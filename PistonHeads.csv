Not due to not driving a typical middle class SUV chariot or concerns that Maserati should not make an SUV. Fine with both of these points but their SUVs are not just special enough to warrant finding a dealer, paying for overpriced servicing and dealing with the colossal deprecation which higher mileage will bring.

foxhounduk,"I think the power train is amazing, the interior is similarly very impressive (I sat in one at the Goodwood FOS last year).It just needs to look more agressive on the outside in my opinion. I get it's a Maserati so the mantra is elegance above everything, but it lacks a bit of spice in the looks department. I agree with the chap above; the front somehow doesn't look like it should belong to the rest of the body?As you guys all know, the Grecale is based on the Alfa Romeo Stelvio; both use Stellantis' 'Georgio' platform. And when you look at the Stelvio it's certainly more cohesive from the front. The new face lifted Stelvio with the Sprint Zagato lights and new facia looks even better!Edited by foxhounduk on Wednesday 10th May 12:30 Edited by foxhounduk on Wednesday 10th May 12:30 ","May 10, 2023"

Julian Scott,"Read this with interest as I replaced a Giulia Quadrifoglio last year with a (new) F-Pace SVR - one of the prime rivals the article cites, and interestingly I found and commented on the Stelvio Vs SVR thread only yesterday - https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...I’ve only seen two Grecale in the flesh, neither the Trofeo obviously, and it’s actually better looking than the pictures foretell, but it’s also not overly distinctive, although perhaps appropriately so for a Maserati.Dropping the new 530bhp Maserati V6 into this car makes for an alluring proposition and had the ingredients to fight with the best. The article even gives the impression that it succeeds to a good level, as whilst it plays second fiddle to the hottest Macan and F-Pace SVR in two specific areas, they also cite that they are high bars to reach, and that the Maserati betters the others in the segment.The one glaring issue is its price point. I bought my SVR last September, brand new but a stock car. Its RRP was just under £88k with a decent level of options. I paid a smudge over £75k cash. What’s more, my car comes with (either standard or the optional extras fitted) all of the £8k of options the test car has, plus more, although with the exception of full matrix LED headlight (I have standard LEDs).I’m sure there will be wriggle room in the Maserati’s price, but the optioned car is over £30k more than I paid and £20k over RRP. Hell of a premium for a Maserati.But, whilst I’m sure the notion of 500bhp+ smaller SUVs makes the blood boil of the driving supremos on here, but as an actual customer in that market, combining entertainment with the practicality medium sized SUVs offers is a welcome market development.

Hifiman2007,"I'm a big Alfa fan. But the Maserati badge to my eyes is on a different level to Alfa,Jag,BMW etc so I would expect to pay a premium over those brands. I see maserati (on badge merit) on a level with Ferrari . Lambo etc. I mean the VW group release basically the same car and then charge a different price for different badges..IE skoda.seat.vw. Audi. So the 20k premium to me is justified. ","May 10, 2023"
BigR,"Quite a Maserati fan (on my 5th, and second Levante). I saw these in the flesh at FoS and have to say that the front is really quite plain and sadly Ford Puma-like. The rest actually looks perfectly decent in the flesh, but that lets it down and isn't enough in tune with 'Maserati' or their sense of slightly different / daring / style.Then, the price of these is pretty rich. The Levante Trofeo is not very much more at all (perhaps £110k in reality), and you get more car for it. If it had a better looking front end and perhaps more of an £80k price tag, it'd stand more of a chance and be a more compact viable alternative to the Levante (which is bloody big).That said, we're all looking at it from our (largely) UK perspective. No idea what their sales spread is across the rest of Europe / world to know whether this will land better elsewhere.As to the comment around digging around for the dealers, this is a bit of a problem too. Maranello is the nearest for me and utterly the most incapable / duplicitous / outright lying dealer (sales and service) of any brand I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Fortunately I live tolerably close enough to another, however, it is a bit of an issue. Equally, it's not a mass-market car, but hell I hope it sells well enough to keep some of the traction going, supporting the ability to build the more exciting stuff such as the MC20 and GranTurismo (in much the same way that Lamborghini or whoever else gets often slated for building SUV's, but they sustain the other products and ensure a viable future for the business).

Wills2,"I like it and would probably go for it against the others, something a bit different and it won't be a bad car at all, I had an X3M and for me they're not the sort of cars you drive anywhere near the limit other than having a blast in a straight line, I'm sure the Trofeo will be a lovely thing to drive.

Its now almost impossible to safely drive a low sports car at night because headlights are very bright now and mounted increasingly higher up on the common SUV's. Even when driving a normal saloon car your eyes are typically now at the same level as oncoming lights. The only safe solution is to raise your eye level above the oncoming headlights. Since its very dangerous to drive with your head out of the sunroof with stilts strapped to your feet, a small SUV is the only remaining option.As long as these small SUV's retain the upright driving position, and are all approx the same dimensions, the status quo will be restored.","February 16, 2022"

ducnick,"With these sorts of cars I wish the reviewers would essentially ignore the halo model bought by the 1%.What we seem to have is a 2 litre, fairly dull small suv just like all the other 2l dull SUV’s. I can’t imagine the vw Tiguan or Audi Q5 /bmw x3/Merc /jag etc etc is any better or worse when it comes to the dull powertrain. They are all dull because they are boring 2 litre four bangers in a brick outhouse.So move onto the other differentiating factors.Is the interior better or worse than the competition? Well it sounds pretty infuriating to me from the review. Certainly no match for proper door handles and buttons in a bmw, but probably about average for the market sector.How about the exterior styling? It looks to me like a big ford kuga with some Maserati badges. The whole thing looks very transverse front wheel drive with a cab forward design. Probably good for interior space, but it’s not a good looker to me.Price? I bet that will be competitive.Dealer experience/reliability … it’s a maserati, when I had one you wouldn’t venture near Britains only dealer, but I’m sure they must have improved now. In the PCP world this probably isn’t a factor.It’s going to be a very hard sell in a market dominated by German brands with wide dealer networks and big advertising budgets.

So a bit over £34k to drive a not-particularly-attractive 4-pot SUV with a list price of £58k for 3 years...that still seems quite a lot. And it's 'only' about as quick as the X3 30d I've been considering, which isn't a performance SUV as such.

Mine was a 2017 car. Facelift from 2020 in the Alfa.The SVR I ended up with by surprise, I tried a C63S and an F90 M5 and found the Merc disappointing and the M5 just dull.The SVR is a very practical and great everyday car, with good luxury. But the surprising thing is how much character it has, obviously it sounds great, has instant thrust, and the handling is fun and the control inputs nicely weighted. The SVR is such a great all round and fun everyday car, and obviously good in all weathers unlike the Alfa.

ducnick,"One of my neighbours has got one already.. oh no it’s a Ford kuga, but they look so similar.There is a fairly complex equation that determines how good looking a car can be. It’s based on size, height, number of doors, number of seats, luggage capacity etc. as a car becomes more practical it becomes harder to design it to look good. Let’s face it, any school kid could sketch a good looking gt car. Try sketching a good looking car that seats 5, has 4 doors, can fit in a U.K. parking space with room to open the door etc it’s hellishly complicated by the packaging requirements of transverse engine, fwd etc.When designing a gt car the designer may features from the stylistic toolbox eg flying buttresses, double bubble roof , coke bottle hips etc to create a pleasing silhouette, that doesn’t work when designing a small crossover. Packaging necessities result in them all looking basically the same. All you can do is resort to different grille, non functional vents etc to differentiate them.Edited by ducnick on Tuesday 22 March 21:08","March 22, 2022"
