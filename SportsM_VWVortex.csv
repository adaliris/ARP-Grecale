Mazda 3s,"After months of releasing preview images and several delays, Maserati has introduced the Grecale, its long-awaited entry-level SUV. The sub-Levante model is aimed directly at the Porsche Macan, and it will likely become the firm's best-selling nameplate in the coming years.The latest addition to the Maserati range stretches 191 inches long and 66 inches tall, dimensions that make it about six inches shorter and nearly the same height as the Levante. Visually, it illustrates what Maserati design boss Klaus Busse meant when he told us that future Maserati models would borrow styling cues from the MC20: its front end is defined by a wide grille positioned below a pair of elongated headlights. Viewed from the side, the Grecale leans more toward sportiness than utility, while the back end wears horizontal lights connected by a strip of bright trim. Vents chiseled into the fenders and trident-shaped logos on the C-pillars link the SUV to the rest of the Maserati range. It's a design that works, in our opinion: The Grecale is recognizable as a Maserati but not a copy of an existing model.Busse told us that the idea wasn't merely to Xerox the MC20's front end onto the body of an SUV.""The design philosophy that I laid out in the beginning was actually done before we designed [the MC20 and the Grecale]. We really had to sit down and get our ahead around what we want to do with the next chapter of the brand. The reality is that 70% of the design process is understanding the message that you want to create, and the car then designs itself and the remaining 30% is just putting it on paper. We didn't want to design the car purely for Instagram; end up with a car loaded with real or fake features, lines, and creases. We're very much about purity. Maserati is a very strong performing car, so it doesn't need to shout, ""Hey, look at me!"" Quite the opposite; it wants to be a rolling structure, a car that adds almost visual value to its environment. That's the overreaching philosophy,"" Busse told Autoblog.Inside, Maserati integrated a relatively long list of tech features without making the dashboard look like the automotive equivalent of an iPhone. The driver faces up to four screens: a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the Maserati Intelligent Assistant (MIA) digital instrument cluster, an 8.8-inch touchscreen positioned right below, and a digital clock — yes, that seemingly counts as a screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility come standard, and the list of options includes a 21-speaker Sonus sound system.How the Grecale's cabin is configured depends on the trim level selected. Buyers have several leather upholsteries and trim materials to choose from, including wood and carbon fiber. We're guessing that the Fuoriserie program will provide additional customization options.""It was time to up the game with our interior designs, but also with fit and finish and with technology,"" Busse said. ""Screens were never something that we were known for. And, to be honest, I don't think that we want to be known for screens. Is the industry at peak screen? But, at the end of the day, we also want to reduce the amount of clutter in the car, so the result is what you see here,"" he added.At launch, the Grecale lineup will include three models called GT, Modena, and Trofeo, respectively. The first two trim levels are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine turbocharged to 296 and 325 horsepower, respectively. It develops 332 pound-feet of torque regardless of horsepower. Linked to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the turbo-four spins the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.Enthusiasts will undoubtedly be more interested in the range-topping Trofeo. Instead of a four-cylinder engine, the flagship Grecale gains a version of the twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V6 called Nettuno and borrowed from the MC20 supercar. The six develops 523 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque in this application, and it also sends its power to the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Brembo brakes help keep the extra power in check, and it sounds like they're needed: Maserati pegs the Trofeo's zero-to-60-mph time at 3.6 seconds and its top speed at 177 mph. An air suspension system comes standard on the Trofeo; it's optional on the GT and on the Modena.Pricing for the 2023 Maserati Grecale GT starts at $64,995 including a mandatory $1,495 destination charge, while the Modena Limited Edition (which is only available online and for a short time) carries a base price of $78,895. There's no word yet on how much the Trofeo will cost.Deliveries are scheduled to start in the fall 2022. Looking ahead, the Grecale range will grow with the addition of an electric model (shown in the gallery) that will wear the Folgore nameplate and that's scheduled to reach showrooms before the end of 2023.What's in a name?Historically, Maserati has named many of its cars after winds, and the Grecale is no exception. It borrows its name from a north-easterly Mediterranean wind that's primarily felt on islands like Malta. Levante, Ghibli, Mistral, Bora, and Khamsin are wind names as well.Click to expand...2023 Maserati Grecale revealed with 523-hp twin-turbo V6 - AutoblogThe 2023 Maserati Grecale is positioned as a smaller alternative to the Levante.

Wimbledon,"I like the styling.If the Grecale EV drives anything like a Stelvio, which it should given that it’s on the same platform, this is probably my next car.But I’m waiting for more details on the EV version. Compared to a Model Y, the Grecale EV has to be compromised because the platform was not designed as an electric vehicle. What will that compromise mean for performance? But in other respects this is more appealing to me than a Model Y.","March 22, 2022"
CTK,"I thought this was just the 500HP firebreather. That one seems redundant to me. The base mild hybrids seem a little weak... should have been PHEVs. The EV is interesting.

Doughynuts,"Of course the hope is that they continue to improve. But a poor track record is very difficult to overcome. Putting out a new shiny piece of turd only digs the hole deeper.EDIT: this is not to be misconstrued as a statement that its a turd. Like I said, I like it. Hopefully it turns out not to be a turd because more competition is always good for us enthusiasts.","March 22, 2022"

Supposedly better to own than an XK or F type, but not quite 981.I know someone who moved from a Cambiocorsa Coupe to the GT and his comments are ""the GT is daily-reliable, more comfortable but less special feeling.""

Wimbledon,"Given this model is on the same architecture as the Giulia/Stelvio, and shares (I believe) the same 4-cylinder engines as the Giulia/Stelvio, reliability should be similar to a Giulia/Stelvio.

The E-Pace is a size down. There's clearly going to be some overlap with the Stelvio Quadrifoglio but this well be an altogether more rounded package instead of going for outright sport.

Galrot,"That's not the Stelvio B-pillar panel though. Also the fitment looks pretty damn good for only they to have been grabbing something and the exact same piece of trim is used in all these late mules that have been photographed.

I also didn't say anything about the fit other than it was ""pretty darn good for only they to have been grabbing something"" either, but of course you don't really care about things such as facts regardless. Also I have no troubles admitting that I don't like most of Maseratis modern offerings. Very few appears to do which is of course their problem.All I'm saying is that the part looks cheap (admittedly my personal opinion) and that you will soon see that it is a production part. It's possible that the car will be absolute hit regardless. Or perhaps it will fail. I can't predict that.","January 16, 2022"

Wimbledon,"I like the Stelvio. And the Stelvio's interior is plenty nice enough for me and wouldn't stop me from owning one. That said, my understanding is that most reviews that compare the Stelvio to its rivals usually score the Stelvio's interior below the others.An example:Porsche Macan vs Alfa Romeo Stelvio: slingshot SUVs twin test reviewCAR magazine UK's Porsche Macan vs Alfa Romeo Stelvio twin-test review: which sporty SUV ticks all the boxes?www.carmagazine.co.uk""Climb inside the Alfa and first impressions are equally pleasing, though closer examination reveals some cheap detailing on the switchgear and gear selector. And it gets worse the lower you go. The bonnet release lever, for instance, appears to be made from one of those curling plastic fish you get in cheap Christmas crackers. Given how frequently you might be asked to lift the lid to show someone that ‘Ferrari-inspired’ V6, you’d think they’d make the lever from something more substantial.""The review concludes that the Alfa is more exciting than the Macan. I'll overlook some interior material choices in favor of a more exciting drive overall, so I'd take the Stelvio.","January 16, 2022"

The MC20 reviews have been excellent and it’s a car that has shown Maserati can fight with the big boys buts it a halo car. They know need to take that good press with that car and build on it and having average reviews will be the death of them with a car like this and this has to sell well for them. I so want them to succeed and make cars that turns the imagine around with Joe public as we need to start to see more bread and butter Maseratis on the road.

They will start every morning and won’t break down, they promise, with apparent sincerity. Yet with this renowned old Italian marque, experience has shown that reality proves less than the sum of these promises.I well remember a Maserati launch during which I heard a terrible thump, which was the driver’s-side window breaking loose and falling into the door bottom. Then it rained heavily.But since January 2021, when Maserati – along with the basket of goods that was Fiat Chrysler Automobiles – became part of the Stellantis Group, promises have to be kept. Or else the mega-group’s boss of bosses, Carlos Tavares, will ease out the recalcitrant division manager, in this case Davide Grasso, on the toe of his boot; believe me, failure is not an option.So, suddenly, in its 109th year, Alfieri Maserati’s firm, founded in Bologna but now headquartered down the road in Modena, has to make reliable cars as well as beautiful ones.The marque’s famed trident badge, devised by Alfieri’s younger brother Mario after seeing the fontana di Nettuno (Neptune’s fountain) in the centre of the family’s home town of Bologna, will now stand not only for style, charismatic engines and fantastic performance, but also dependability.What’s more, Maserati’s finances, so often convoluted and deeply unprofitable, are to be put on a sound footing. To that end, Maserati is following the market to deliver this, the Grecale, a smaller, family-sized and more affordable SUV, which follows in the footsteps of the Levante large SUV of a few years ago.Can it be true? The renowned Italian purveyor of sports cars and gran turismos producing a family SUV to do battle with countless bland Volkswagen ID.4s, Volvo XC40s, BMW X4s, Jaguar F-Paces, Audi Q4s and, of course, the Porsche Macan. Really?There are four versions, all arriving this year, starting with the £61,570 GT, which has a 296bhp/332lb ft 2.0-litre turbo engine with a belt-driven starter/generator mild hybrid system and an electric turbocharger to mitigate the lag before the turbo spins at its most efficient. It is capable of 149mph and 0-62mph in 5.6sec, with economy of 32.5mpg and CO2 emissions of 198g/km.The £67,180 Modena tested here has a bit more power at 325bhp, the same 332lb ft of torque and top speed, but will accelerate to 62mph in 5.3sec, while delivering 32mpg and 199g/km.The top model is the Trofeo, at the distinctly top price of £99,700. It has a 3.0-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine developing 523bhp/457lb ft. It’s capable of 177mph, with 0-62mph in 3.8sec, 16.2mpg and emitting 254g/km.A battery electric model called the Folgore (Italian for thunderbolt) will arrive later in the year.All models are four-wheel drive with a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. The top Trofeo has air springs, active dampers and an electronic limited-slip differential; the others have conventional steel springs, passive dampers and a mechanical limited-slip differential, which can all be upgraded to Trofeo spec. The upgrade to air suspension costs £1,400.The options list is quite a scary place, actually, with 21-inch wheels at £1,585, carbon-fibre twill trim at £2,030, a driver assistant pack of adaptive cruise, active lane management, blind-spot monitoring and LED matrix headlights at £2,535 and a Sonus Faber premium 21-speaker sound system at £2,200.That’s just for starters. The £67,180 Modena tested here ended up at £84,775 when all the extras were included. The Grecale is built at the Alfa Romeo factory in Cassino, Italy, alongside Alfa’s Stelvio SUV, with which it shares its platform (also used in the Alfa Giulia saloon and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV).Family SUVs such as the Grecale tend to have generic styling, because that’s what the market likes and no one dares to go against the grain. While the vibe is very much that of the Porsche Macan, the Grecale’s front is lifted by a large, toothy grille with a prominent trident badge. A trademark trio of vents in the wings pull the eye along the body curves and the pronounced haunches over the rear wheels look purposeful.The front seats are generous, with good lumbar support for your lower back, but quite pinchy side cushions that squash your kidneys after a long time at the wheel. Electronic seat adjustment allows a good driving position, but the seat feels too high and taller drivers might find themselves wishing its base were a couple of inches lower.The digital facia consists of two screens: the instrument binnacle, which is clear and concise, and a centre touchscreen, which is relatively simple to navigate, with the gear selection buttons underneath. Buttons operate electronic latches to open and shut the doors, which would have been a brave move in the old days of Maserati, and there’s the panoply of modern electronic connectiveness, including a WiFi hotspot, an Alexa virtual assistant and a telephone app that will continue to give you last-mile directions from the satnav after you’ve parked up.There’s also the traditional Maserati clock at the top centre of the dashboard, now in a switchable-face digital style; such a pity it looks and feels pretty cheap. On the other hand, the trim and fabric choices seem well matched, pleasant to touch and more luxurious than the upmarket herd.The rear seats are comfortable and plush, with just enough leg room for one 6ft adult sitting behind another. Head room is reasonably generous, too, and three adults fit in the back easily.The four-cylinder engine sounds flat and unresponsive initially. You need to boot the accelerator pedal, but then it spins up into the strong mid-range, with the electric turbo giving an alacrity to its responses. It sounds good at high revs, but the urge tails off rapidly and there’s not much point in searching for the red line.","May 28, 2023"
MarkMas,"The ZF eight-speed is a lovely gearbox, slurring changes when needed, kicking down fast when full power is required and responding quickly to the steering-wheel paddles. The Sport setting leaves it in a higher gear than you’d normally choose, but it’s ready for the call.Will you notice the extra 30bhp of the Modena version? Probably not, but most folk will take it because more is more and the higher power doesn’t punish you too much at the pumps.The Trofeo is the diva of the range –expensive, the V6 lovely to listen to, technically accomplished … and quite nice to hand back before you face the bills. And while it’s something of a dragster, when it comes to a corner, particularly a bumpy one, it reveals every single one of its extra 187kg over the weight of the Modena.Like all of these high-riding SUVs, the Grecale has to satisfy the need to ride gently while giving the impression of cornering like a sports car, and the result of this moderation is seldom completely satisfactory.With all-round independent suspension, Maserati has achieved a good compromise for the air-suspended cars, but a brilliant compromise for the standard steel suspension, which rides well, steers with precision and corners with lean but not sloppiness.The standard chassis feels well balanced and surprisingly comfortable compared with Porsche’s Macan. This new Maserati, entering one of the most heavily competitive classes of car, feels like one of those left-field choices that turns out to be a surprisingly sound one.You’ll have your own views on whether Maserati should be providing well-heeled families with SUVs such as this, but then you’d probably have to have the same opinion on Porsche and its equivalent as well.As it stands, the Grecale is good-looking, with a fine combination (for the class) of ride and handling, while the overall dynamics are impressive. But this is an expensive car – prohibitively so if you dig deep into the options list – and you can have a desirable Porsche Macan with a V6 engine for less whether you buy it outright or take a PCP finance deal.What’s more, as with any car, Maserati’s claims of great residual values (RV) are hot air until you sell your Grecale or realise the final value settlement after a three-year lease. It’s still a risk, but unlike in the past, the Grecale is slightly less of an affair of the heart and more one of the head.The factsBody style: Five-door family SUVOn sale: Summer 2023 (Folgore battery-electric version follows later this year)How much? range £61,570 to £99,700 (£67,180 as tested)How fast? 149mph, 0-62mph in 5.3secHow economical? 30.7mpg to 32.5mpg (WLTP combined), 28.5mpg on testEngine and gearbox: 1,995cc, four-cylinder turbo petrol with 48-volt mild hybrid system, eight-speed automatic gearbox, four-wheel drivepower/torque 325bhp @ 5,750rpm/332lb ft @ 2,000-5,000rpmCO2 emissions: 199-210g/km WLTPVED: £1,565 first year, £570 next five years, then £180Warranty: 3 years/unlimited mileageThe rivalsRange Rover Velar S P250from £53,735Appears much larger than the Grecale, although it’s actually only 4,797mm long. Prices get pretty eye-watering as you go up the range and deeper into the options list, but this sleek and refined 4x4 is best enjoyed in this modest 2.0-litre, 248bhp turbo petrol form. It has a top speed of 135mph, with 0-62mph in 7.1sec, 30.1mpg and 214g/km of CO2.Porsche Macan Sfrom £59,800This rival from Stuttgart costs from £53,400, but the £60,000 S model is a fairer comparison. It punches out 375bhp which delivers a 161mph top speed, with 0-62mph in 4.8sec and a best economy of 25.4mpg, with 251g/km CO2 emissions. The interior exudes typical Porsche craftsmanship and solidity. Great handling, although the ride can be firm.","May 28, 2023"
