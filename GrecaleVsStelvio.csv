AugurMan,"Just for kicks, I test drove a Maserati Grecale today.I was amazed at how the engine looks almost exactly like a Stelvio 2.0 liter engine. The airfilter, turbocharger, intercooler reservoir, engine coolant reservoir, etc, are all in the same place.The interior and dashboard are quite different from a Stelvio. Instead of a gearshift, it has buttons on the dashboard for Park, Neutral, Drive, etc. The Maz has five different drive modes.It's definitely a more luxurious car than the Stelvio. And one definite advantage is better legroom for the back seats.It doesn't have the sportscar-like handling of a Stelvio. But it gives you a pleasant ride, especially over bumpy roads.One thing that surprised me is the engine is much louder in the Maz, especially in the performance mode. I like the sound. Probably has a different exhaust manifold than the Stelvio. The salesman said it is in honor of the company's sportscar heritage.Overall, I'm glad I got a Stelvio. But some people would prefer the Maz's more plush interior.","April 22, 2023"

My Beautiful Stelvio,Thanks for your informative write up. I’ll have to check the Grecale out when I’m at the dealership for an oil change in June. I haven’t seen one on the street yet. I love my Stelvio and doubt that the Grecale can tear me away from it!,"April 21, 2023"
Anunnaki,I also prefer the Stelvio. I don't care about the luxury and really hate the overly digitalised center console. Maybe I am just old school ? The sound of the exhaust is different and better in the Maz .I am sure the exhaust system is different though. Also I prefer much more the QV compared to the Trofeo especially when it is much cheaper for equal performance and sound. Overall the QV is the best performance for the money compared to any brand and model now.,"April 22, 2023"
My Beautiful Stelvio,I also am not a fan of the overly digitized dash. And I certainly prefer having our shifter in the center console.,"April 22, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Semi-equal performance depending on the mode, Maserati just did what Alfa said they were going to do...when Alfa originally said they were going to do it. (I hope Alfa is at least getting paid internally for all these other brands taking thier engineering, cause just like the Hornet, Maserati actually did very little engineering outside of what Alfa already created probably.)Maserati is now showing the Grecale Folgore to be avalible as a 2025 model.Full EV, center mounted battery-pack, dual motors, up to 750hp/1300+ft/lbs,0-60 in 2.7 seconds projected.Maserati introduces its first fully electric SUV in the 500hp Grecale FolgoreA new fully electric SUV is due out from the Italian luxury performance brand marking Maserati’s second EV. The Maserati...electrek.co(Notice it gets credited as a Formula E derived chassis... That's a load of BS. It the Alfa chassis that got written off years ago as if it wasn't being used anymore. How they got away with the is a mystery since they seem to be using it everywhere but at Alfa - also remember the reason for writing it off was supposedly it couldn't be made into an EV? Seems like that was a lie)This is exactly what Alfa talked about in the press a couple years ago, describing thier upcoming EV. Remember? Back when they said the brand would be ""electrified' by 2025? That seems to not be happening.....Instead Maserati will get EVs on the chassis and they will cost very near to $200,000.Considering this, I believe either Alfa will increase the pricing on the next Stelvio substantially, or we will get a cheaper platform.... Like the ones Peugot uses currently. It'll still have 700 HP and be faster then the current models but the chassis will be cheap and the dynamics watered down to be like Audi, it'll have a flat pack battery like every other mainstream EV...bet you $1000.No way they are going to give a Stelvio EV the same power and chassis as the Maserati. Going forward. Not unless the next Alfa near doubles in price, and I don't think Stellantis will ever try to sell an Alfa in this segment at $150,00+.IMO the next Stelvio will be more like the Tonale then the current Stelvio. An ancient hand-me-down chassis with a pretty body design stuck on top. I bet Stellantis even does something similar to what they did for the current ""new"" Quattroporte.... Take a body design that looks near identical to the current generation and put it on a different chassis. But unlike the Quattroporte which went to a better, more expensive, chassis, Alfa will go to a cheaper one. (Which is easy since the current chassis might be the most expensive mainstream platform on the auto industry in terms of design complexity and manufacturing at the price point.)Enjoy 'em while you can, like I said many times before as soon as the next generation of Alfas is released.... The current gen will be hailed as the best deal ever offered in a performance vehicle.Btw: as I also said before... suspect this goes back to when Stellantis wrote the Giorgio platform off. I believe it was written off as an ""Alfa Romeo"" platform.Only an Alfa Romeo platform,if so .... Then legally any other brand but Alfa can use it for new developments, Alfa couldn't though. Pretty sure we will see in a few years that's what happens...the Giorgio goes to other brands and Alfa gets cheap platforms with the larger SUV above the Stelvio being built off the RAM pickup derived body-on-frame chassis and the Stelvio getting a repurposed FWD Peugot chassis... Not the Giorgio (but it'll be like the Tonale and engineered to have ""rwd dynamics"" through full-time AWD tricks). I don't believe Alfa can use this chassis after this generation or that they are currently developing any new cars on it for themselves. What Sellantis said in court when they wrote off the chassis is true... As far as Alfa goes, the Giorgio platform is dead.But Maserati and Jeep can use it....high end /performance model Dodge's and Peugot's can and will use it... Just no future Alfa's.Hope to be wrong, but I think in the future Peugot will have the Ferrari-engineered (Italian) chassis while Alfa gets the Geely engineered (Chinese) ones.Edit: I think the other new Maserati EV built off the Giorgio platform is the Granturismo Folgore. That's the one where the new one and the old one are visually near identical. It's one of 'em.","April 22, 2023"
mike8888,"I think the Stelvio interior is vastly underrated. I would not change a thing, even the info which is subtle and blends in well. That said, the Muzzled Rottie, as my girl friend calls them, are gorgeous.","April 22, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Maserati Is Building Its Largest Lineup—But It Won’t LastThe EV phenomenon is coming for Maserati, and not every model is going to survive.www.motortrend.comIf anyone is wondering why Alfa is planning on focusing less on performance and more in tech and luxury ...This and the Grand Cherokee are why. Dynamically the Grecale and the Grand Cherokee are a step down from the Stelvio. They are also arguably less attractive and cheaper to build/assemble because of it (harder to line up all the curves), but they have more tech and ""corporate"" no doubt believe that and less dynamic chassis tuning are why.Now... To all the enthusiast out there who have been afraid to buy the Stelvio or Giulia because you think they are ""unreliable Alfa's"".....1) The Alfa is no less reliable then the Maserati, if anything the less tech means it is more reliable. It is also less expensive for a better handling and slightly smaller vehicle with better structural rigidity.2) That Porsche SUV or Audi, or Benz or whatever ""performance"" SUV you own/are shopping is a joke compared to an Alfa. The other cars might be faster... Dynamically they are joke. The Stelvio does not ""drive amazing for an SUV"", it handles amazing for a dedicated sports car.... It just happens to be an SUV. The Giulia just happens to have 4 doors..and can shame most dedicated sports cars with 2 doors. When this generation of Alfas goes away...... So will your last and really only opportunity to experience an automotive enthusiasts nirvana without spending near $200k (because the cheap Grecale doesn't do it IMO, but the expensive one does) Maybe I'm wrong but seriously doubt it..... If you don't own an Alfa and truly love driving - through corners and every other part of driving besides raw acceleration (which even the base Alfa is no slouch at, and rewards driver skill in ways others car don't)....Chances are it will be a decade before anything remotely on the level of these vehicles will be offered at these prices. Fear Of Missing Out should be real.","May 5, 2023"
CSalpha1,Interesting take on the performance differentiation of the brands. Sounds logical given the positioning. No doubt The stelvio is a one of a kind. This is why I will eventually replace my Stelvio………. With another stelvio.,"April 25, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"The Grecale is like a middle aged Stelvio.It technically can still fit in its high school football uniform... But it has to suck it's gut in to get the buttons buttoned, and still has some moves but not like back in the day.The Grand Cherokee is the same thing but another alternate universe version where by the time the Stelvio got to be middle aged it became so overweight the high school uniform wouldn't fit and when it tried to run down the field it fell, twisted something, and needed help getting back....Same car.. but, one is in its prime.. one grew up but stayed in shape sorta and the other.... Ate too many potato chips and watched too much TV.IMO it's a crime the parents company of these cars only bothered to advertise the two non-prime versions. The reason the Maserati and Jeep outsell Alfa is because Maseratis and Jeeps get the advertising budgets that Alfa Romeo has never has.Take a group of kids at a school, lock the smartest kid there in a closet, don't let him participate, don't give him(her) any of the new information being giving to the other kids..... It isn't surprising, or that kid's fault when he starts getting bad grades.... It's the teacher's.And here.... First FCA and then Stellantis have as of yet failed Alfa Romeo. Thing is... Is kinda doesn't matter because the cars are still that good.... But probably won't be for long. Get 'em while the getting is good.Thankfully while the Maser is not as dynamically rewarding as the Stelvio it shares something like 80% of everything with the Stelvio so.... Parts will never be an issue probably.","April 25, 2023"
AugurMan,There is a persistent myth that Alfas have severe maintenance problems. It's not supported by the empirical facts at all.,"April 25, 2023"
C.Q4,"I am not sure why there is animosity against the Grecale. Grecale is what the new Stelvio should have been, slightly larger (adults can fit in the back), and it offers a hybrid and eventually BEV tech. People are crying that Giorgio was killed off, yet it lives under the GC and Grecale. I'd like the Grecale's extra space, while retaining everything else that makes the Stelvio.Yes, it gets more advertising. That is because Maserati is the luxury brand of Stellantis. The top dog. Jeep is always going to be more popular and it does a great job of fitting it's customer's needs.They have Giorgio, AlfaLinkTM, and you can get a hybrid-2.0GME. So I fail to see the issue?","April 25, 2023"
lost1750GTV,"""Stelvio should have been""I've got nothing against the grecale, but not everybody thinks it should have been a bigger more lux vehicle.Many, me included, would far prefer a shrink wrapped short wheel base version of this platform.","April 25, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Ok.. important..It DOES NOT retain everything that makes the Stelvio special.The Grecale is MORE expensive with LESS body rigidity which yields a poorer ride AND worse handling. Again, for more money.Lastly no hate towards the Grecale. No, my ""hate"" is for the corporate executives who have been treating Alfa like a ******* stepchild since Marchionne passed away, and who decided it was an either/or situation...Either they support Maserati or they support Alfa. Either they build a car focused on performance, or they build a car focused on technology.... either, or.It doesn't have to be that way at all. Not even a little bit. Giving Maserati all the options Alfisti have been asking for the removing most of the color options from Alfa to given to Maserati.... Unnecessary and yes... Hate might be the right word for how it makes me feelThe Grecale can get a great car.... It's success does not have to mean Alfa Romeo has to start watering down their vehicle dynamics to try and be Audi... Like Maserati does.Nothing against Maser. They make great cars and I am glad they are in the market. Also nothing against Audi. What I am against -again- is turning Alfa into a wanna be version of either of those brands.... Or worse.... The ""luxury"" version of Dodge.With the right support.. maybe listen to the Alfisti who support the brand instead of dumping them to chase other grand's customers.... Alfa Romeo could be one of the premier brand sin the world. The cars it builds already are.... Stellantis needs to build on that not take it away and give it to other brands which is what I see happening.And the Grecale is not what the Stelvio should have been, but it's is a great model based off the platform that should be able to coexist simultaneously. Again.. no reason for it to be an either/or situation.Both can exist and both can succeed, one doesn't have to become the other. The problem with Alfa is and has been how the parent Corporation treats it... It isn't and hasn't been the vehicles.","April 25, 2023"
C.Q4,"I don't want more luxury, but the car is tiny in the back. The wheelbase is actually rather long on the Stelvio, but due to the RWD/Longitudinal platform, it pushes the interior space back. This limits legroom, and makes the back seat of the Giulia and Stelvio nearly useless. BMW and Grecale add an inch or two to the wheelbase for a some more space.The Tonale (FWD/transverse platform),with a shorter wheel base, has more legroom than the Stelvio. I am not saying that is a better car to drive, but the packaging is better for passengers. BMW RWD has merely added an wheelbase.So, it would be nice for some better interior packaging. It is odd that I can't fit more than a laptop bag behind my seat in the Giulia. Good luck fitting adult legs.***A SWB version of Giulia, meaning a coupe, would be awesome. A 4 door would be terrible.","April 25, 2023"
C.Q4,"Why do you think it has less body rigidity and a poor ride (probably has softer springs)?It is on Giorgio, it uses AlfaLink suspension and the semi-virtual axis steering. Those are the traits that make the Stelvio/Giulia gems. It might weigh more, and be slightly longer, but I'd like to see technical evidence that it is less rigid, or offers a worse ride.","April 25, 2023"

So, it seems the difference is tuning the electronic steering and possibly the torque distribution. So, the platform is basically the same, they just dialed it back for comfort. Got it.Sounds like an Alfa Romeo Stelvio version would have the great dynamics that you want, with some more legroom many want (and buy a BMW X3 instead because of).

The Stelvio/Giulia have about 12"" of space between the front tire well and the front door, where a FWD platform car has 2-4"". That space, used by the engine bay, is taken away from the interior. This is why most cars are FWD platform, to allow for more interior space.

Not all or even most RWD cars have this layout for the reasons you mention, passenger space. When designing this platform the emphasis was not in passenger space. Plenty of cars on the market that do that, don't know why ever car has to but oh well.

C.Q4,"He has held a lot ofroles, but in 2018 he was named Global Head of Alfa Romeo. He was not named as CEO of Dodge until 2021. He was mostly Dodge North America head at different times, but that's not as senior. I understand there are other positions before/after Alfa. I don't think he retained old roles while getting new ones (perhaps some of them). Either way, the Tonale/Hornet were probably pitched to FCA together. It is most likely that the volume of the Hornet is what made the business case for Tonale. Without Hornet, Tonale may have never happened. Who knows. Clearly, having Kuniskis involved with both companies helps. The main point is that there is nothing Dodge about the Tonale, it uses a Fiat platform, a Fiat engine and basically the Jeep 4xe rear eMotor (whoever actually makes it). It is more Italian than American.STLA-Large has nothing to do with Giorgio. It's not renamed. Hoperfully, it will get AlfaLink. It's not a lesser version of Giorgio, it is a brand new skateboard chassis.

ALFAOFFROAD,"The Small-wide platform under the Tonale is 20 years old and shared with the Alfa Mito as part of Alfa's pre-relaunch line up.The Guilia/Stelvio and the entire new factory were made so Alfa would no longer be stuck with crap like that platform.But now it's back and you think that's good?Realize I have been following Alfa closely since 2017. Owned one since 2018. Others here have done so, longer.Do you honestly think anyone who works for Alfa and wants to continue doing so will say what actually happened if that isn't the corporate line? I've worked in the auto industry... My experience is that companies tell you what to say and if you don't say it you get fired or convinced to quit over things like that. At the dealer level, so I assume corporate is worse.Here's the facts as they are for anyone watching in real time.Alfa released details on the Tonale. Had show cars for years in advance, with lots of details released slowly during the development as far as what engines and model range would be available.Then right before the Tonale was supossed to hit the market .. Dodge got the Hornet with every option Alfa announced originally, while Alfa suddenly wasn't going to have them and was going to pushback their launch. Maybe that was always the plan and Alfa/Dodge just lied about what models Alfa would have and when they would release.. or maybe... Something changed part way through and the plans changed....As for the platforms.... Yup.. Stellantis sure did say the Giorgio platform was dead. Nobody would get it anymore and the all new cars/EVs will be on the ""new"" STLA platforms.They also say the Folgore EVs models Maserati is releasing are based on formula E, which might be true, however they are also built directly on the Giorgio platform with minimal modifications. Same platform Stellantis ""killed"" because they said it wasn't able to electrified.If you haven't figured it out yet.... Stellantis doesn't seem to always tell the truth. Took me a few years to figure that out... Back when I had only owned a Alfa a year I was a lot more forgiving of their BS. Now.. I wish Stellantis sold Alfa to VW. Stellantis sucks.

C.Q4,"So your issue is that Tonale is on SCCS and not Giorgio? Sure, it would be great for Tonale to be on Giorgio, but it is a RWD platform, and Tonale is a small CUV on a FWD platform. That platform allows for more interior space within a smaller wheelbase. That is what C-Segment CUV buyers want...frankly, most CUV buyers want more interior space/cargo space over anything else. Giulia/Stelvio/Grecale/Grand Cherokee are all on Giorgio, so you have plenty of options to choose from.SCCS originated with Alfa MiTo, so it is just as Alfa as anything else. Plus, Alfas were Fiat-based and FWD for how many decades? This is what the low end (higher volume) side of the Alfa segment is used to; MiTo and Giulietta.Alfa released a concept car with a power point. Then when Stellantis was created and leadership changed, JPI halted the release of Tonale because he wasn't happy with it's performance numbers, and you know, we were in the middle of a pandemic with terrible supply chain issues. They finally decided to release official numbers on the Tonale and the Hornet as well. If the Hornet idea didn't exist in 2019, it certainly happened a few years ago. It takes time to develop a new car, even if it is badge engineering...which isn't completely true, since the interior as some differences, plus functions, etc which are not shared (Power Shot).Grecale is not on a Formula E platform, that is not for retail cars. It is on Giorgio and uses electric motors that are from or influenced by their partnership in Formula E now. In reality, it's probably just marketing speak and not real.Giorgio is dead for all future development. Grecale and GC were developed years ago before the announcement. Now, the next Giulia/Stelvio will be on STLA-Large.If Stellantis sold Alfa to VW, they would be on the MEB platform. So, that's not any different than STLA-Large.

No thanks to the Alfa Romeo press service but because, as I waswww.italpassion.frPersonally - after driving a Hornet - my opinion is the same. Were the Tonale the first Alfa I ever drove, (assuming it drives like the Hornet which seems to be the case) I would not be driving an Alfa. I'de be driving an Acura or a Mazda because both are more entertaining cars in that market segment to me. (Though neither is what I would call entertaining outside of a comparison to other cars in that horrible driving segment)Of course the reply to this is those are the base model! Of course it doesn't drive great!Again... Base model Stelvio/Guilia still drive great. HP is not required for a ""fun"", ""dynamic"" driving experience as Mazda and many other brands including Alfa have demonstrated for years.More so.. the component choice in even the premium, Hybrid Tonale belies any sort of real performance regardless of any marketing jargon.The Hybrid Tonale uses a 6 speed automatic transmission. A transmission made by Aisin - who is owned by Toyota - a transnission shared with such notable performance vehicles as the Toyota RAV4 and Sienna along with the Suzuki Swift and other ""performance"" vehicles. Nothing about the Tonale is impressive or even premium sadly. It looks good though.To be clear.. not even Toyota uses that transmission in a performance vehicle. They use it in Camrys and mini vans...and it's their transmission. Literally designed by them..and they don't use it for anything performance oriented. (INTERESTINGLY, Lotus did use that same transmission in the 2012 Evora, which had tons of problems with it and required multiple revisions due to numerous transmission failures)Also,Battery electric vehicle do not have ""almost zero maintenance"", they have different maintenance, which doesn't get performed every 5k miles, it must be followed like religion every second the car is owned. The maintenance is how much and fast it is charged and how far it is driven in low charge.An EV owner must make sure to never charge over 90% or under 10%, at least not regularly. They also make sure to precondition the battery in cold or warm weather, along with other guidelines that must be followed or turn the battery into a brick that can only hold 20% of the original charge which the manufacturer will say is just fine under warranty and not a problem to be fixed. The maintenance is different but no less important and just as expensive if you eff it up. Easier to eff up, if cheaper to do also.. with less ability to fix. But hey..... Whatever right?

(Italpassion).I have zero experience with the PHEV's Aisin transmission, but considering the segment it just has to work smoothly to be popular. The ZF8 isn't amazing. I would much rather a manual transmission over it. Even if it the best, or close to the best, automatic on the market. It's still lumpy, abrupt and less engaging than a manual. The ZF-S6 manual used by old Euro Giulia QV and BMW would have been a better option.EVs do not have annual maintenance. I have owned 3 Teslas. There is nothing to do at your dealership. Change the tires as required. I even took my car in for a 2-year brake fluid change...nope, it was fine. They sent me on my way. Since the brake pads are rarely used, they last for 100,000 miles+. You have to charge the car, just as you fuel your Stelvio. Yes, there are differences, but that's a part of the experience.","May 3, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Don't charge above 90% or below 10% ever.. not unless you want to lose range significantly depending on how often and badly you don't follow the rule.That is the maintenance. It costs nothing, unless you don't do it. Then it costs you the ability to drive the car eventually.Again, cheapest Stelvio drives amazing. Cheapest Tonale should too.. if it were an Alfa in anything other then the name. But it isn't.The magazine and pundits say this will save the brand.. because SUV.Absolutely hilarious thing about that...They said the same thing about the Stelvio.They were wrong... But sure, this time they'll be right because the Tonale is smaller and doesn't drive as well....the Stelvio didn't sell because it drove too good, too performance oriented... So making the Tonale performance lame but acting like it isn't cause of the market segment, that will change things... riiiiight.All they are doing is alienating their current customer base while expecting a new one to appear out of nowhere. Which will happen because the market segment is so hot? Literally the exact sne reasoning they used with the Stelvio but this time the vehicle itself is less impressive and has direct competition from a better priced model with a longer option list within Stellantis...Sorry but that seems like the most foolish thought process possible in this circumstance. They aren't just thinking ""If you build it, they will come."" Yeah . That's never worked before but this time it will because the car has nothing special about it.Meanwhile .... The RAV4 hybrid is faster by a country mile. Yeah, the Tonale handles better but as you and everyone else continually points out, in that market no one cares how the car drives. Again, sorry but this all just sounds dumb. Like running off a cliff cause everyone else is.Maybe it will save Alfa. If that means Alfa become cheap Audi..... Who cares? Not me. Maybe others will however I suspect people who like Audis will keep driving them and Alfa will continue to be a joke in terms of sales.Alfa doesn't need poorer handling cars, Alfa needs a marketing budget and a parent corporation that offers real support. Without either of those the rest doesn't matter.","May 3, 2023"
C.Q4,"100%. Tonale will live or die by marketing, increased awareness and investing in perceived reliability.I do think that you will have some Alfa owners buy a Tonale for their teen, or a young family (with Alfa grandparents) might get one. Outside of that, it is an uphill battle to convince new-to-the-brand buyers.All of this could be helped, but FCA/Stellantis has not really tried.I made two suggestions to Larry Dominique. 1) include a maintenance plan with purchase price and 2) extend the warranty. He was open to the maintenance plan.","May 3, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Then, in my opinion...As an outsider who can't possibly know anything right?He's yet another example of corporation promoting people to their highest level of incompetency. It's called the ""Peter principle."" (Being nice by saying this .. my first choice of words was not as politically correct)More examples of poorly differentiated badge engineering failing then succeeding. A LOT more... Add in a shift in the brand that has the possibility of alienating the current consumers.... Yeah... Far more failures then successes.A 10 year warranty is quite probably the only route to Alfa's success, outside of lots of marketing and a 10 to 15 year commitment to not change the brand but rather build on it by giving the cars more options and installing more dealers with better training. Meanwhile Alfa couldn't get a 5 year commitment after spending a billion dollars on a new platform and factory, and never had any marketing to speak of. Releases ""updated"" models that have fewer options then what came before....Yeah..... Eff Stellantis for all this. Just my opinion.. which you are re-enforcing, not changing. Do hope to be proven wrong in terms of the coming platforms and driving dynamics. Hopefully the Tonale is a one-off for its market segment and not a harbinger of things to come...However, I will say add this: the STLA Large platform is pretty much confirmed to be a skateboard-type battery pack. It will not be like the Maserati Folgore's with the center mounted battery which is magnitudes superior in terms of chassis dynamics to the skateboard layout. The skateboard layout ..... The next Alfa's might drive alot like Tesla and Kia EVs. Take that as you may, they will not drive like Maserati EVs... The Maserati's will be better, and based off the chassis under our cars.","May 3, 2023"
Vivo678,"Regardless of what current Alfa owners want and the direction they would have chosen for the brand , once Alfa goes over to the dark side, all electric, it's going to be a direction strange for lovers of history and the brand. In my opinion the Tonale needs to remain in Europe where fuel consumption is a bigger factor and smaller cars are preferable. I doubt that the Tonale is going to lure American buyers. The BMW models are fully established in this market segment and actually reflect a certain status, the badge sells. Here comes the Tonale which is late to the party as the Dodge Hornet is marketing the crap out of their version, the Hornet. I don't personally think that the Hornet is ugly, same colors, same seats, same engineering and cheaper with more market exposure.If Alfa tuned the Tonale for performance and handling, given they have had a big delay, I can see it swaying consumers away from the Hornet , especially if reviews supported the idea that the Tonale was a driver's car, but that's not the direction and it's not going to happen. On top of the Tonale's lesser performance compared to the Stelvio it's just not a fresh look. It looks like a Stelvio got hit in the nose to flatten it... in my opinion the rounder sexy front lights of the Giulia/Stelvio are correct to the design language.I like the Tonale as a small SUV in the European market, less so in America unless it is priced as the Hornet, then I think it's more attractive.

MotivationalMade,Why do you think it has less body rigidity and a poor ride (probably has softer springs)?,"May 4, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Rigidity goes arm-in-arm with ride quality. Weak bones make a weak structure, which make a poorly performing suspension where all the road imperfections come through the body.I am particularly sensitive to vibrations and twisting, notice more in the Grecale. There have been a few reviewers that have commented on feeling the body twist in hard cornering or when hitting a mid corner bumps also. However.. who drives like that in an SUV right??","May 4, 2023"
AugurMan,"I gave the Grecale Modena I test drove last week a good workout. Did some hard cornering and drove over bumpy roads. The Maz handled itself well, but not as good as my 2018 Stelvio Sport.","May 5, 2023"
ALFAOFFROAD,"Absolutely. If the Stelvio didn't exist the Grecale would be arguably the best handling SUV around, bar none..(the argument could be made for the Macan/Cayanne as the Grecale is more like them dynamically then the Stelvio. The Stelvio is the top of that heap.. Grecale makes the heap more of a plateau, the peak is flat with room for several cars. Basically the same pile as before except the top got bulldozed off and the Stelvio was -is- the only vehicle up there, now there's a little extra dust pile where the Grecale sits to make it a tiny bit higher then the Porsche....).I think the plan is ... As-is... The Stelvio won't be around much longer to be messing the Grecale up.The next one will not measure up to the Maserati .. but will be better then your average Volvo or Honda for sure.Not kidding, get while the gettin's good unless you think $100k is a reasonable amount to spend on a car. This level of dynamism won't be available at these prices for much longer... Or even at higher prices really.","May 5, 2023"

ALFAOFFROAD,"Since we are talking about the Tonale ....I think this guy's review is pretty spot on for a ""typical Dodge buyer"" perspective.He likes the car, surprising himself he does. What really matters though is how he reacts to the interior.. to him, it's an Alfa Romeo, European...which is why he is surprised he likes it as much as he does,..... To him ""European"" is not a good thing. I think that will be a lot more common of a reaction then expected, the typical Dodge person will think it's european which will probably cost a few sales, however that same feeling of ""european-ness"" will also probably attract a lot of would-be Alfa buyers who would rather have a longer options list and a lower starting price ......","May 5, 2023"

(That might be paying $10k to beta test software)Regardless....it's a step backwards in every way butBeing shiny and distracting. Just my opinion.Yeah..Jeep is going to make a killing on the Giorgio platform. Although they call it the WL and swear it's thiers.The only unibody Durango is the current one. The other gens were all ladder frame. Not surprising they will go back to it. Jeep won't give Dodge thier modifications to the Giorgio platform, and it's too expensive to use as-is. (I'm not sure what all was done but I know Jeep took so long to use it because it took them that long to make it affordable..there are alot of cutting edge assembly techniques materials and methods of bonding dis-similar materials utilized on the platform.)I need to drive the new GC, local dealer doesn't have one yet. The L, I thought was sweet though.(Edit) was looking for info on what Jeep did specifically besides using more steel and less aluminum, found a Stellantis blog that provides a little reference on what I've been saying about Giorgio being adapted to the next Stellantis corporate platform. That is what is happening. They aren't killing the Giorgio, they are adapting it for the next gen.Giorgio is being converted to STLA LargeSeveral publications recently ran stories on the death of the sort-of-new Giorgio platform, designed to support medium-sized and large cars and crossovers for Alfa Romeo, Dodge, Jeep, and possibly Chrysler. The reality appears to be different: Giorgio has simply been brought into a new naming...www.stellpower.com","January 25, 2022"
CSalpha1,"I couldn’t agree more. That dash in the Giorgio and stelvio is so classic in every way. Simply beautiful. Planting a screen compromises the Italian design phylosophy and they are very protective of that. Italian design is their most cherished differentiator.

ALFAOFFROAD,"To be fair Maser never made its own parts. The old ones were from the Benz parts bin cribed back when FCA and Benz were part of the same company.Considering those switches were shared with Dodge products, this is a step up. Maserati has always been blasted for it's switch gear.(Let's not forget, the base Maserati V6 is the Chrysler corporate V6 - used in minivans - worked by Maserati. Love Maserati but they have always been saddled with using other people's stuff and had to make the best of it).I seriously can't get over replacing gauges with a single flat screen. What is it about animated menus makes people ignore the fact that is utterly useless In any direct sun. Useless.

ALFAOFFROAD,"Ha! Column mounted shifter.. the definition of an old person's car. I see that and think.. ""Hey, its my grandfather's Buick. That car sucked."" Total unfair prejudice but I think that's why more manufactures don't use it.Guess my issue is the idea of a screen adding value is impossible with how I think about driving. Showing more information etc, I do not care.I don't look around the interior of my car while driving, if I do...it's a glance. Never more. Which doesn't work with screens, they take too long to read. I want a guage with a needle, readable by instinct out of the corner of my eye. Operate all controls by touch, I don't even look at the audio system when changing songs, just wait to hear it. While driving all I want is engine and vehicle speed, gas and temp, I want them out of the corner of my eye. And I do not want anything inside the car reflecting glare into my eyes while driving. Ever. Never ever. The idea of that makes me irrationally angry. The gauges themselves do that. I don't want more reflective surface area there.HUD is sweet, but even then. I don't want the outside or inside temperature, or a compass, or anything but speed, gas, engine temp, and I want every single accessible control to be switchgear operable without looking. All of them. Each control should have a mighty different feel, readable like braille. (Not like Porsche does though..overkill)Not saying I'm right and anyone is wrong. Just learning and sharing perspectives. We are all right for ourselves.For me, it's about not getting in an accident, ever. 31 years of driving a few million miles, I have never had an accident besides being rear-ended at a stoplight, spun out plenty, lots of crazy stuff...no impacts.Pretty sure not looking around the car at stuff has been a factor in that, want to die at 100 with that record. I was in some bad accidents as a child (parents driving every time. One of them I was in the rear facing seat of a 70's station wagon with no seat belt. You can maybe guess how that went. One of my first memories, not a good one.), literally don't remember a time without back and neck problems of some sort, migraines, and as such.. not having a vehicle impact me, or me impacting anything is a huge priority. Overrides everything else to an irrational extent.Touchscreens make me think I will get in an accident while staring at the screen for 3o seconds solid trying to hit the exact correct spot required to activate some truly inconsequential thing. But the road is bouncy and I'm old so I keep missing it.Except it won't be inconsequential...it'll get me hit and all that pain comes back. Either that, or it'll be when the sun is in the exact right place to reflect off the screen in front of me making me have to squint and struggle to see clearly and won't see well enough to respond in time to whatever stupid thing some other person does for no reason...which means I don't get out of the way...and they impact me.Sure it's total paranoia but it's how I feel. Hate 'em.I wouldguess though ya'll don't have childhood trauma that makes you paranoid. Which makes sense now that I think about it. Good for you. Everyone I know tells me I am too intense about this stuff.","January 26, 2022"

But you are paying for a performance engine with a plush but still small car. The ideal one would have been a 350bhp 6cyl - some downtuned nettuno with still great soundtrack. The other 200bhp is just not necessary in that car. Then it’s a bit hard to swallow 50% premium over QV for something will not be as keen as qv. So trofeo is purely a poser car. But then again if you don’t know any of this then it should be fine. It’s just I reckon if you were to go for maser image and luxury you may as well get the trofeo levante which would have the actual Ferrari v8. That is very special.

I could get a nicer, newer Stelvio for the same money as an older Macan Turbo with more miles. My wife was on board because the Stelvio Quad is also faster than the Macan Turbo. I subjectively think that the Stelvio handles better and looks better.","June 19, 2023"
alfa63,"When my wife wanted to move on from her 2011 BMW X3 about 18 months ago, she decided on a Macan (we purchased a 2017 Macan S). Which means we didn't cross shop any other cars. As for the various models for the Macan, we focused on the ""S"", not the Base, GTS, or Turbo. (We only looked at 2015-18 model years.)I used this website to lookup the options and build date of the various Macans we were looking at.Porsche Build Sheets and Window Stickers by VIN | VIN Analytics(Porsche also has a configurator if you are going the new car route and want one tailored to your/her desires.)The website was helpful as the various dealers invariably either didn't list all the options are listed incorrect ones.If you have any questions, let me know.","June 19, 2023"

rusty mayes,"Well, today we went back to the Alfa/Maserati dealership to rule out the Stelvio or Grecale before pulling the trigger on the Macan. My bride sat in the Grecale and was instantly smitten. We drove the Modena model and although it is not a rocket like my Quatroporte, it was fast enough to be scary. We did not drive the Stelvio as my wife was already in love. We pick her up on Thursday! Ended up going with metalic black which will be our first black car ever. It really is striking. Thanks for the input, I have a little trepidation buying a first year production car but nothing ventured nothing gained.","June 19, 2023"
rusty mayes,"My bride is wanting to replace her 2022 Range Rover Discovery. It is quite pedestrian and boring although it is loaded with safety features that she likes the most important of which is the rear-view mirror that is a digital monitor eliminating blind spots.We went shopping today and first stopped at San Francisco Exotic cars in Marin and looked at Maserati Levantes, Grecales and Alfa Stelvios. Unfortunately, they were short staffed, and we could not find anyone to talk to, and all the Alfas had just come off the boat. They were all just covered in salt and grime and sitting in the lot crammed full of other luxury models. We decided to come back later and instead went to the Porche dealer to scratch and sniff on the Cayennes and Macans. Cayenne is too big but the Macan just felt right. I would like to explore the Stelvio but I think the wife is set on the Porche. I was really stoked when she saw the Stelvio and liked it even better than the Maserati Grecale. Just wondering if you Stelvio guys considered other SUVs or were just sold on the Stelvio because it is Alfa Romeo.","June 19, 2023"
southernstar,"Top Gear has a comparison test from a few years ago of the PorSche Macan Turbo vs. the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio that is worth reading. Both are outside my snack bracket ( my wife drives a BMW X1 ), but it seems that the Alfa is faster and more responsive, if less well put together and harsher.","June 18, 2023"
John5495,Just a matter of preference really. We did not drive anything else because my wife was pretty set on the Alfa. Bummer you had a less than great experience at the AR dealership as a test drive might have been enough to seal the deal!,"June 19, 2023"
