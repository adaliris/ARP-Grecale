EDZ,"I know there are a few on here with orders placed and waiting for their cars and curious as to when delivery maybe, as very little information on progress or news comes from dealers.So thought I would start a new post for people to post any news about their order status to give any info for others waiting. May be post when you ordered, roughly where you are based, estimated delivery date, model and any other update info received. Or if you are a lucky one when you picked it up.I will start: Based in UK, ordered beginning of April, estimated delivery mid October Trefeo Primasirie. Latest info should have car sometime this month. 🤞Hopefully by posting your info it will give others more of an idea of what is going on, I know we have one lucky member already received their car.Thanks.","June 8, 2023"
EDZ,"Another slap in the face today. Just had call from my dealer and the car is again delayed and will now apparently not be here until mid December earliest, might as well have said not until 2023. 🤨 Apparently build delay's mainly on right hand drive cars as far as I'm aware, yet I was told the car went into build beginning of August !!! someone is not telling the truth...............🙄","November 3, 2022"
Modenacanada,Same here. Got a call from my Canadian dealership. Was intitially told October. Now they are telling me mid to late December. It seems like 2023.....,"November 4, 2022"
EDZ,"Thanks for the reply ""Modenacanada"" So obviously not just right hand drive cars delayed. I'm sure they will turn up eventually and yes I'm thinking 2023.","November 5, 2022"

EDZ,"Welcome to the forum.Yes, as you say very little info and never accurate. I also don't contact the dealer every week, I contact the dealer when I was told by them a date the car should approximately arrive, then I'm told another couple of months, that's the frustrating thing, just a little more info and update occasionally would be good.","November 14, 2022"

Trident,Welcome to the forum@David! Good to hear you got an update about your Grecale. How did you spec it?,"November 21, 2022"
David,"So I have chosen Grigio Lava with Nero seats, Giallo stitching, yellow callipers plus sunroof and privacy glass. Can’t find any pictures online of a Moderna in Grigio Lava but the promo film shot in Rome looks like one of the cars is Grigio Lava.","November 21, 2022"
EDZ,Hi David and welcome to the forum.Thanks for the update and nice to hear from another RHD buyer from Britain which is obviously of much interest to myself as we appear to be in the same boat. Last update I had a couple of weeks ago was that my car should arrive early to mid December. But I'm kind of not expecting it till 2023 as the last two dates for delivery given of October and then mid November have come and gone.,"November 22, 2022"

mbo222,"Based in Indiana, USA.Sigh. Placed order in June for a trofeo. Dealer has no clue as to arrival....was to be mid Nov.","November 25, 2022"
EDZ,"Thanks for posting mbo222. I have just had another update from my dealer and as expected another delay not arriving next week. Thats 5 different delivery dates given over the last five months so far and still no sign of the car, apparently end of December now. I told my dealer only now contact me when the car has left the factory and on it's way or when it is at your dealership, as I will just take it the car will be here sometime in 2023.","November 25, 2022"
UKTrofeo,"I live in the UK and have a Trofeo (not Primaserie) on order. Originally it was meant to arrive week 47 2022 but now postponed to week 52! Dealer mentioned that Maserati are doing significant quality control checks which is causing the production line to be shut down and hence delayed. Seeing some of the comments here about new cars already having to go back for updates does give a bit of concern.However, I visited the dealer yesterday and their first 2 Grecale’s have now arrived in last few days - no Trofeo’s though. Good to see cars starting to arrive (apparently 25 now arrived in UK). My dealer indicated that he should have 25 Grecale’s delivered by the end of the month, despite Christmas!","December 6, 2022"
EDZ,"Welcome to the forum and another UK member.Yes they are now arriving but like you not mine. I am a little frustrated and annoyed considering I ordered a Trofeo Primaserie in April this year, and according to Maserati advertising ""qoute"" ""Be the first to own before anyone else"" by ordering a Primaserie and mine not even here yet, what utter bull shite from the manufacturer, and Trofeo's for sale on Auto Trader now.","December 6, 2022"
EDZ,"Just had a phone call from my dealer, can't believe what Iv'e just been told, yet another delay and not to expect my car before February 2023 but more than likely beginning of March 2023 😒 but still no actual confirmed date for arrival. To say I had a few choice words to air with them is an understatement, but hats off to the manufacturer and dealer with a better customer relationship response this time and for now what they have done and given has soften the blow a little, but they still have a little work to do to reinstate my confidence and trust in them, lets wait and see what happens next.","December 16, 2022"
UKTrofeo,"Oh no! That’s no good. I’ve just phoned my UK dealer and on their system my car is still showing as week 52, but I guess there is a good chance mine is going to be further delayed as well. Did they give any reason for the delay?","December 16, 2022"
EDZ,"To be honest I think I have had every excuse in the book since ordering. This time Iv'e been told it's to do with the specialist colour finish which is done out of house, and it's them that are having problems. So you may still be lucky and get yours, will be interesting if you don't then I will know if what Iv'e been told is true or not. Good luck","December 16, 2022"
Modenacanada,Wow. I'm sorry to hear that. My dealer has called and told me the car arrives in his dealership next week.,"December 20, 2022"
UKTrofeo,"Just had an update from my dealer and surprise surprise my car is not going to arrive next week. Now pencilled in for week 3, ie mid Jan. Only slightly positive news is that it has moved a little along the production line. But honestly how long are these going to take to arrive? No Trofeos arriving in the UK this year.","December 21, 2022"
EDZ,I hope that pans out OK for you. Don't forget to let us know and post some pic's. Good luck.,"December 21, 2022"
EDZ,"Sorry to hear that, but kind of telling me what I was told may not be trueDid they give you any reason for your delay ?","December 21, 2022"
UKTrofeo,"No. They said they have no idea. Previously they told me that extra quality control checks are being made and cars being pulled of the production line to do this, slowing production down a lot.","December 21, 2022"
TF007,@EDZI am really very sorry about that. This takes away the excitement and it is simply untenable. The Prima series should be the first to be delivered. Hope it arrives shortly.,"December 22, 2022"
EDZ,Thanks. I trust you are still enjoying yours and all is going well.,"December 22, 2022"
TF007,@EDZYes I am still happy. Nothing negative to report so far.,"December 22, 2022"
UKTrofeo,So potentially some more positive news. My dealer contacted me to say that my car is now progressing quite quickly through the production line - the production line codes have now increased 3 times this week. And the date of delivery has remained at week 3 (ie mid January). The dealer is now pretty confident it will arrive then. We shall see.,"December 23, 2022"
EDZ,I wish you luck that it pans out. Unfortunately that has been said three time to me already and the last one being the fourth time that never happened was in writing (email). But I guess our cars will arrive eventually sometime in 2023.,"December 24, 2022"
UKTrofeo,Has your dealer given you the production codes for your car? Mine has moved from 20 to 50J,"December 24, 2022"
EDZ,"To be honest Iv'e stopped asking. As in July this year I was told my car was at status 20 and slowly moving along production line. Nearly six months later I'm told having trouble with paint finishso I personally take status codes with a pinch of salt. Sorry I don't wish to be a party pooper but I have as Iv'e said before had every excuse in the book why it has not yet arrived. All Iv'e ever wanted is honesty from the manufacturer, even the dealers are getting frustrated, they are obviously taking the flake by just passing on what they have been told.","December 24, 2022"
UKTrofeo,Well I’m trying to be optimistic. The dealer has had a number of GTs and Modenas delivered so are aware of the broad way that the production codes have progressed for cars that they have had delivered recently. If your car has reached production code 50f a while ago then certainly I would be less confident. Mine was on code 20 for months. I’m guessing that right hand drive Trofeos have been a bit of an issue for Maserati hence the delays. However a paint finish issue would affect Modenas and GTs as well. Mine is a different colour to yours. We will see if there are further delays pretty soon!!!,"December 24, 2022"
EDZ,"Unfortunately my optimism has been knocked several times, but I still smile and hold on to some hope that it will turn up soon. The Trefeo Primaserie is a specialist four coat colour finish under the fluorecie program (according to the price list I have a 15k extra) and not done on normal production line run as other colours listed. The car is pulled from line and painted else where apparently, so does not follow the same line production run schedule as all other cars, hence what I was told last update. As you say will be interesting to see what they say in the new year, my dealer is far more optimistic for the Q1 delivery but will no longer say he is confident. 🤣 All the best, and have a great Christmas.","December 24, 2022"
UKTrofeo,I’ve now been given a specific delivery date of 21 January. We shall see 😉,"January 5, 2023"
EDZ,"Pleased for you, better news as being given a specific date is far more promising 🤞 hope it all works out this time. Good luck and keep us all posted.","January 5, 2023"
UKTrofeo,"My dealer called with another update. The date has remained at 21 January and the production code has moved on to 85 which means the car has been completed, just undergoing final checks before being dispatched. My dealer said that their first Trofeo arrived this week and mine would be their second. I’m crossing my fingers!!","January 12, 2023"

Tony Mac,Looks fabulous 👍👍,"January 27, 2023"
edit,hello everyone?did you get any discounts when you ordered the car?,"January 27, 2023"
EDZ,"Welcome to the forum edit.It's been virtually impossible to get discounts on any new cars for the last couple of years, due to supply and demand. Manufactures have been struggling to get parts linked with the semiconductor shortages and just can not produce the amount of cars required for the market. Add to this that the Grecale is a brand new model and orders are buoyant, they have no need to discount, plenty of customers in the queue. You may be lucky and get something thrown in but don't hold your breathI'm sure as the parts shortage and semi conductor issues slowly subside, linked with the current bad global economy figures, the rise in cost of living and energy costs, demand will ease and maybe a little discount will return, but not for a while yet. IMO, anyone that has got a discount would had been a very, very lucky customer or an employee of the dealer or manufactureGood luck.","January 27, 2023"

vicster,"I had it configured back in April last year. Delivery was supposed to be in October but I'm guessing they were still passing inspection to be approved for the road.My dealer had a few cancellations so buying from stock was possible. In fact, I ordered a white one and they were able to swap it for a black one configured the exact same way ✌","February 19, 2023"
edit,"Just payed today the deposit for a Grecale Modena nicely configured.The dealer said the estimated delivery time is 3 to 4 monthsbtw, in the contract I have a paragraph that is mentioning the price will be retroactive increased if the production cost will increase until my car will be delivered.Did you have something like this when ordering yours?","February 22, 2023"
Tony Mac,"Good choice editEarly January, when we started considering ordering a Grecale, the Dealer said it would be a 4 month wait and that they were expecting a Price rise in March. So taking delivery in April / May would be at the increased price.The Dealer had a Launch Event with New Stock Grecale's in the showroom - we bought a Modena and picked it up the following week","February 22, 2023"
EDZ,"Congrats on placing your order edit,hope your wait is not to long.Most manufacturers have that type of paragraph in the sales contract, actual price you pay as that quoted when your car actually goes into build. Dealers normally ask at that stage to increase your deposit to a full none refundable 10% of total cost of car, no increases normally after that point even if it takes a couple of more months to eventually arrive at dealers.","February 22, 2023"
1stMaserati,@EDZare you still waiting????? Any updates?,"February 22, 2023"
edit,"The same message I got here in Romania...there will be a price increase in March/April.Anyhow, I lost excatly 5 weeks because I asked for 5% discount, that finaly got it but with my time expence.Maybe I could escape the retroactive price increase from this spring if order was placed at the end of January.@Tony MacThe issue with the stock cars is all got 21 inch rimms and wanted only 20 inch as roads here are a complete mess sometimes.Also all have glass roof and didn't wanted as our plan is to keep the car over 10 years and all the cars with glass roof will be eventually 'flooded' after some years.The hook in the back was needed also (for some Thule device for bicicles) and none from the stock got it.The only real option for me was to order one in production and to wait.","February 22, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi 1st Maserati.Not Good News 😒To be honest I'm at my whits end and just about had enough now. The 8th Delivery date supposedly the beginning of this week never happened, no car arrived at the dealers, despite Maserati saying it had left the factory. My dealers are just as annoyed apparently and at a loose end as to what is actually going on. Iv'e been waiting over two days now for an update on current situation as is my dealer also, no response from Maserati as of yet. This really has gone beyond a joke now and is absolutely diabolical customer service and relations on Maserati's behalf, even my dealers are now lost for words as they can only inform me what Maserati tell them, and obviously what they have told me so far and the numerous delivery dates over the last six months has left them embarrassed and with much egg on their face. Time to look at other options out there now I think, there is only so much S--T, crap and lies one can take.","February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Further to above. Just had an update. Maserati have reluctantly just informed my dealer that all Grecale's were held back at the factory and none were actually dispatched. Apparently they have a software issue and won't release any Grecale's until they have sorted the problem, as it has to be done manually to each car and can't be done over the air, (suggests different parts fix to me) So basically anyone out there waiting for a car from factory will have a delay (so I'm informed), no time scale for this has yet been given. Maserati are obviously playing cloak and dagger and keeping issues hidden as best they can, but obviously there is only a limited time they can hide things especially if no cars are being released from factory. The wait goes on 😠 and I also can't wait for the next excuse for none delivery of my car, Iv'e had so many, surely there can't be any left in the book to quote.","February 23, 2023"
Tony Mac,Shocking EDZ - I couldn’t have waited this long 😞,"February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi TonyTo be honest if I had been told I would be waiting over a year for the car when ordering it, I may have looked else where then. The trouble is that Maserati have been playing me along, each time a delivery date arrives it's not met and I'm given another delivery date which is normally only a few weeks later, so I hold fire as most new cars at present are taking around six months. If we all had crystal balls I'm sure we would all do things differently, but life at present is so unpredictable. Do hope your car is going well and you are still enjoying it.All the best.","February 23, 2023"
Tony Mac,"You are stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I’m sure it will be truly worth the stress and frustration of waiting.In December 2022 we were considering a Mecan / Cayenne and the build wait was 12+ months.Still enjoying our Modena, only done 350 miles - no issues to report🤞","February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Glad to hear your still enjoying your car Tony and all is going well.Yes my last few cars have taken 12+ months to arrive including my current Macan GTS, but I'm told that at the outset and they have pretty much arrived as told. The difference here is Maserati told me 6 months and I'm nearly a year (give or take a few weeks) in and still waiting, that's the frustrating part. If you are told delivery time when ordering you accept or reject that time and work to those times, give or take a month. Maserati have not been up front with information or kept me informed from the outset, diabolical customer service and relations and I thought Porsche were bad 🤣The best of this is: I had an email direct from Maserati back in July 2022 welcoming me to the family and informing me my car was in build and should be with me very soon 😱 from then on they went into hiding 👻","February 23, 2023"
edit,"@EDZI was thinking this morning regarding your situation.Maybe Maserati delivered the car actually and maybe your car has technical problems and in fact is in the dealer warehouse trying to fix it.If your car was at Maserati factory with some issues, it is impossible to not have the technical knowledge or resources to fix it. They are delivering cars on daily basis to all the corners of the world. So, what are the reason to not replace quarter of your car, if needed and to deliver the car, if the car is still at the factory?If your car is at the dealer and the dealer is lying to you, the repairs are more difficult via air at the dealer and always the dealer needing to have maserati mails and sugestions.If I was you, I will visit the dealer without telling him upfront and tell that you want to search the car in the back warehouse/garage to be sure that they are playing wright with you as the trust regarding them is lost. They have to demonstrate you this is the reality and they don't have the car in pieces somewhere. do not leave until you inspect the dealer and do not give them time to hide the car.My dealer told me they will deliver my Modena in 3-4 months calculating from the downpayment.","February 24, 2023"

They have to demonstrate you this is the reality and they don't have the car in pieces somewhere. do not leave until you inspect the dealer and do not give them time to hide the car.My dealer told me they will deliver my Modena in 3-4 months calculating from the downpayment.Click to expand...Thank you for your thoughts and suggestion edit.I have already visited the dealers on a few occasions and the car is definitely not there. My dealers are part of a very large group and also very large in the USA and are the largest Maserati dealers in the UK with branches all over the country.Late yesterday I actually email Maserati direct in Italy to get honest clarification of what is actually going on with my car as my dealer is at a loss also. Iv'e had an acknowledgement receipt of same and will have to await what they finally reply, but will contact again early next week if not received.","February 24, 2023"
TF007,"Hello@EDZthis is simply shocking and unacceptable.We are talking about a car that has a worldwide delivery time of about 3 to maximal 4 months. At all dealers, moreover, the car is in stock. Here something runs completely wrong. Even if it should be because of your equipment variant, they must be able to name that and offer options. By the way, the current Macan GTS has a delivery time of 3 months again and in general, delivery times have dropped at all manufacturers.If they can't provide a very clear and logical explanation (which they haven't been able to do so far), then I would withdraw from the contract.

This is as he said, something that they have never seen or heard of before and he is very interested in knowing the outcome.

1stMaserati,"That is really heartbreaking to read@EDZ. Just as Maserati is getting great press and Stelantis looks like really re-polishing the brand (look at the Granturismo) and trying to push itself into the space where others have been so successful (i.e. Porsche and the Macan), it is simply mind boggling that situations like this (no one can track your primaserie order?????) can happen.If the entire customer experience sucks, then the brand suffers.Pure speculation, but maybe things with the UK dealer and Maserati Italy are not as good as they appear and that is the root cause? So there is a problem that you are not seeing or privy to. What is weird is that you had several promises of delivery with a date. Either this was the dealer plucking it out of thin air to placate you or how else can that be explained. Can you “demand“ a VIN number and ask if the car has even been built?Hope this resolves itself soon!","March 7, 2023"

EDZ,"Hi AllIv'e been a little hesitant posting updates as Iv'e had eight delivery disappointments so far.This week I have finally had several phone calls from Maserati Italy !! Firstly the car has been found, so Wally has not got it 🤣 It's built and has a VIN number sitting in a warehouse at the factory awaiting dispatch. No Grecale's have left the factory for over six weeks now apparently, all on hold due to updates etc on software. Apparently it is actually illegal for them to release cars knowing they have issues or faults to correct, hence the sudden stop on dispatch over six weeks ago. I'm so far told that release should finally start happening very, very soon and my car should be in the UK by end of March. They have had numerous problems with the paint, parts and building the my car due to it's very top end spec etc. Iv'e had apologies from several people in Maserati and awaiting a final phone call, as to what they intend to do to make up for it and that the car has been released and on route to UK. Lets hope this is the last time and I don't receive more disappointment and it arrives as been told direct from Maserati. 🤞","March 15, 2023"
1stMaserati,Great news@EDZ!!!!!As an aside… What does this all mean for us on the road in a Grecale? Is there a recall wave coming for all of us with software updates? Funnily I was the the dealer today (less than 3 km from home and next to the petrol station I normally use) as I knew the new Granturismo arrived. They did not mention any software recall for delivered cars.As for the Granturismo… easy on the eyes is all I can say!,"March 17, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi 1stMaseratiDuring my conversations things I was sort of told were tongue-in-cheek and still a little cloak and dagger as to real reasons, so obviously some can be taken with a pinch of salt. But I was lead to believe that most software updates can be done over the air, that is cars that are on the road, but new cars are not fully livened up until they arrive at the dealers and sold, so require manual update. Basically they told me as little as possible but keep me happy.Cars are now being released and in fact some are now arriving at dealers.

I do understand looking at news bulletins that the French are doing their usual protests and blockages of roads and ports etc at present. Apparently over president Macron's increase in pension age law, and the fisherman over EU new rules coming in over fishing nets.

edit,"To be honest, if I was you, I will take the car as it is and return for repairs only when the spare parts needed have arrived.Because it is possible for them to have problems in the suply chain, as the model is new and also a niche model. Maybe you will wait another 1 or 2 moths for the spare parts.Back in 2008 I had a brand new model of Audi A4 and hit a dog with it. As the model of the car was new, I had to wait over 1 month for the spare parts to come, as it was difficult for them to supply.

UKTrofeo,"I’d suggest not doing the coating on the front where the ppf is going. I had full body ppf install done and my independent xpel installer strongly recommended avoiding the Gtechniq completely as the ppf fits better without it. Xpel actually designed the ppf for the Trofeo with my actual car, as it was the first Trofeo with a full body install","April 3, 2023"
Tony Mac,May I ask the approximate cost for Full Body PPF?,"April 3, 2023"
UKTrofeo,One other point to note is that the screws that Maserati supplies to fix the rear number plate to the rear plate holder are too long and therefore go into the paintwork causing damage. This was spotted by my ppf installer and fully rectified by my dealer free of charge. The dealer checked their other Grecales and ALL of them had damaged paintwork as a result of the long screws. Once rectified and the ppf installed I binned the rear number plate holder and just installed the rear number plate with thick double sided sticky foam pads. (The sticky pads would adhere to the rear number plate holder securely!!),"April 3, 2023"
UKTrofeo,Not cheap. About £5k including full paintwork detail,"April 3, 2023"

Tony Mac,"ThanksWe had the same issue with the Tracker Fob for the first week after taking delivery. Leaving the Security Fob in a coat pocket placed on the rear seat or in wife’s handbag, triggered alerts and phone calls.Vodafone got quite annoyed and said take it out of the leather Maserati pouch - we ignored this. But started placing the Key + Fob in the central cup-holder, which stopped the alerts.Dealer said it shouldn’t be an issue leaving the Fob in the pouch, so long as it was in the car.Will experiment placing it in ‘other’ places to see if this has been fixed.","April 3, 2023"

My wife was against it and always is asking me why we did such a mess with our money.It is clear it will have technical issues, but what stress me the most is going in a trip and car beeing completly dead and refusing to work.

EDZ,"Hi edit.What you should bare in mind is ! One of the majority reasons owners join any forum is the fact they have a problem or issue with their car and start to do internet research, this happens with every manufacturer. Just look at how many have joined this site recently for that very reason, because they have an issue or want to air their anger at the manufacturer. So you will always see and read many issues with cars on forums in the early days/months/years of release, but a good platform for such. Once the membership grows over the years and the car gets known these will become less. Considering how many cars are made or have been made, a forum is not really a place to get best averages, owner members probably only make up aprox 30% of this site. I feel for everyone that has issues or problems but there is also many out there including myself that so far have had no problems whatsoever with the car and probably many more of those that are not forum members. Some of the issues I have read have also been due to owners not even understanding their own car as of yet, covered in the hand book or something not even spected on purchase, and some are just niggles they don't like, just as you get with every different make of car. And some issues derive from poor dealer backup, know-how and after care, many of whom really don't know the Grecale as of yet and are more interested in sales (profit margins).Looking forward to your pic's on collection, which sounds like it's not far off.","May 6, 2023"

So it is clear for me there are technical issues as a car production is tipically one week.As much as I love this car, it is a complete stress for what will follow and that is taking all the joy from me. My wife was against it and always is asking me why we did such a mess with our money.It is clear it will have technical issues, but what stress me the most is going in a trip and car beeing completly dead and refusing to work. My wife will ask for divorce))))).Next summer we will do a car trip of over 4000km and of course we will do it with the 2 years old Audi A6.But still we have some 'short' trips allready planed here in the country of 500, 700, 250km that we will do it hopefully with the Grecale and allready I'm stressed about it.Meanwhile I asked my dealr for the invoice and I paid the Modena in full 2 days agoClick to expand...There are teething problems yes, but I have driven more than 8000 kilometers and have not had a single problem so far.In this respect, I would not worry too much and you have warranty in any case.","May 12, 2023"
WarrenB,"While I agree in principal, the issues raised on this forum show a trend which is helpful in diagnosing issues. My car has many of the key and key beeps issues a lot of others have raised which I have fed into my service center to help resolve the issues and what it does highlight is that it’s a systemic problem rather an isolated problem with my car. It’s been in the service center for 3 weeks now and Maserati are trying to resolve the issues remotely without any luck so far.The number of different issues does show the lack of testing done and I get the impression that Maserati rushed the car out to get ahead of the launch of the new Cayenne and Macan updates. I didn’t spend $100k to be a beta tester.","May 12, 2023"

edit,"Delivered today.Already did some 85 miles and I'm very pleased.Looks perfect, drives perfect.The first 10 miles where horror as it is a complete different car compared with sedands I'm used with.But slowly I started to accomodate with it and I'm feeling like I'm driving it since monthsThe first 10-12 miles where city driving and the rest highway.I was pushing it 90-110mph always and combined with city driving and also having in mind the highway driving was constantly uphill (from 200ft altitude to 1700ft altitude), the return is 17mpg.I'm still learining how to lock this car)))Also, this car is not child friendly...the isofix is burried somewhere and it is difficult to hang the child seat...I will destroy the leather in that area.Also, maybe you will check how it is yours. You are puting the car in Aero 1, you are modifing the driving mode and when you will return to previous driving mode, the car will go to normal height position. As a matter of fact, when you switch the driving mode, the height of the suspension goes to normal position.The braking pedal is too soft for my liking. You need to push alot to brake.Completely different compared with Audi A6...I'm not sure if it was soft also with 5 series. But as far I remember, yes.I know when I bought the A6 I had the feeling it is too hard and it was braking hard after few mm pushing compared with 5 series and it was difficult to adapt also.","June 25, 2023"

edit,"I will not insist about the things thst are fantastic with this car l, as allready were spoken by others, but only on what could have been better from my perspective.For our country, it is more logic that refuelling to be on the right side of the car.The truck it is not enough with 535 liters. At least not for me.I have touch screens commands also on A6. When you are pushing a button, it vibrates like you are pushing a real button. This distractes you somehow, as you need to concentrate yourself. On the other hand, on the Grecale it is too sensitive. I really dont remember when I started my seat heating when driving..only felt the seat started to burn. Probabily the best solution is in between this 2 cars.The fan of the AC is a little bit noisy. Anyhow, the AC is colling the car 3 times better than in the A6.This car is not built to accomodate a child seat. You can accomodate but at the expense of destroying the leather on that area. This is what will happend with mine.The tow hitch is a complete joke. It is not electric deploiment, not even mechanic deployment. You have the hitch in your truck and you have to manually put it under the car. You have keys to remove the hitch, keys that you cand loose it, it seems difficult and dirty job.The insulation could have been better. I have insulated windows, but still it is a lot of noise inside the cabin.The fuel tank is tooo small. At least 2-3 gallons extra could give you more confort.Today we will have 120miles trip back home, all type of roads. Leets see what is to be added.","June 25, 2023"

UKTrofeo,"I live in the UK and have a Trofeo (not Primaserie) on order. Originally it was meant to arrive week 47 2022 but now postponed to week 52! Dealer mentioned that Maserati are doing significant quality control checks which is causing the production line to be shut down and hence delayed. Seeing some of the comments here about new cars already having to go back for updates does give a bit of concern.However, I visited the dealer yesterday and their first 2 Grecale’s have now arrived in last few days - no Trofeo’s though. Good to see cars starting to arrive (apparently 25 now arrived in UK). My dealer indicated that he should have 25 Grecale’s delivered by the end of the month, despite Christmas!","December 6, 2022"
EDZ,"Welcome to the forum and another UK member.Yes they are now arriving but like you not mine.

To say I had a few choice words to air with them is an understatement, but hats off to the manufacturer and dealer with a better customer relationship response this time and for now what they have done and given has soften the blow a little, but they still have a little work to do to reinstate my confidence and trust in them, lets wait and see what happens next.","December 16, 2022"

EDZ,"To be honest I think I have had every excuse in the book since ordering. This time Iv'e been told it's to do with the specialist colour finish which is done out of house, and it's them that are having problems.

UKTrofeo,Has your dealer given you the production codes for your car? Mine has moved from 20 to 50J,"December 24, 2022"
EDZ,"To be honest Iv'e stopped asking. As in July this year I was told my car was at status 20 and slowly moving along production line. Nearly six months later I'm told having trouble with paint finishso I personally take status codes with a pinch of salt. Sorry I don't wish to be a party pooper but I have as Iv'e said before had every excuse in the book why it has not yet arrived. All Iv'e ever wanted is honesty from the manufacturer, even the dealers are getting frustrated, they are obviously taking the flake by just passing on what they have been told.","December 24, 2022"
UKTrofeo,Well I’m trying to be optimistic. The dealer has had a number of GTs and Modenas delivered so are aware of the broad way that the production codes have progressed for cars that they have had delivered recently. If your car has reached production code 50f a while ago then certainly I would be less confident. Mine was on code 20 for months. I’m guessing that right hand drive Trofeos have been a bit of an issue for Maserati hence the delays. However a paint finish issue would affect Modenas and GTs as well. Mine is a different colour to yours. We will see if there are further delays pretty soon!!!,"December 24, 2022"
EDZ,"Unfortunately my optimism has been knocked several times, but I still smile and hold on to some hope that it will turn up soon. The Trefeo Primaserie is a specialist four coat colour finish under the fluorecie program (according to the price list I have a 15k extra) and not done on normal production line run as other colours listed. The car is pulled from line and painted else where apparently, so does not follow the same line production run schedule as all other cars, hence what I was told last update. As you say will be interesting to see what they say in the new year, my dealer is far more optimistic for the Q1 delivery but will no longer say he is confident. 🤣 All the best, and have a great Christmas.","December 24, 2022"

EDZ,"Welcome to the forum edit.It's been virtually impossible to get discounts on any new cars for the last couple of years, due to supply and demand.

You may be lucky and get something thrown in but don't hold your breathI'm sure as the parts shortage and semi conductor issues slowly subside, linked with the current bad global economy figures, the rise in cost of living and energy costs, demand will ease and maybe a little discount will return, but not for a while yet.

EDZ,Then doing really simple man math's you would have to get at least 13% off to be any where near on par with UK prices as Swiss prices are more nearer 33% dearer.,"February 2, 2023"
edit,"You are tring to buy the Modena trim?Here in Romania the Modena starts at 72.900 euros plus 19% VAT, so 86.750 euros including VAT. I added some options and only got 3% as discount. As I said to them, I will not buy aat this level of discount.I can see in Switzerland the Modena trim starts at 97.250 CHF, so 98.360 Euros...but this is because the CHF is very strong this months. Normally it is 90% from the Euro","February 9, 2023"

edit,I'm planning to pay the down payment next week also for a Modena.Did you got it from stock or it was your configuration?I'm curious about the waiting time,"February 19, 2023"
vicster,"I had it configured back in April last year. Delivery was supposed to be in October but I'm guessing they were still passing inspection to be approved for the road.My dealer had a few cancellations so buying from stock was possible. In fact, I ordered a white one and they were able to swap it for a black one configured the exact same way ✌","February 19, 2023"
edit,"Just payed today the deposit for a Grecale Modena nicely configured.The dealer said the estimated delivery time is 3 to 4 monthsbtw, in the contract I have a paragraph that is mentioning the price will be retroactive increased if the production cost will increase until my car will be delivered.Did you have something like this when ordering yours?","February 22, 2023"
Tony Mac,"Good choice editEarly January, when we started considering ordering a Grecale, the Dealer said it would be a 4 month wait and that they were expecting a Price rise in March. So taking delivery in April / May would be at the increased price.The Dealer had a Launch Event with New Stock Grecale's in the showroom - we bought a Modena and picked it up the following week","February 22, 2023"
EDZ,"Congrats on placing your order edit,hope your wait is not to long.Most manufacturers have that type of paragraph in the sales contract, actual price you pay as that quoted when your car actually goes into build. Dealers normally ask at that stage to increase your deposit to a full none refundable 10% of total cost of car, no increases normally after that point even if it takes a couple of more months to eventually arrive at dealers.","February 22, 2023"
1stMaserati,@EDZare you still waiting????? Any updates?,"February 22, 2023"
edit,"The same message I got here in Romania...there will be a price increase in March/April.Anyhow, I lost excatly 5 weeks because I asked for 5% discount, that finaly got it but with my time expence.Maybe I could escape the retroactive price increase from this spring if order was placed at the end of January.@Tony MacThe issue with the stock cars is all got 21 inch rimms and wanted only 20 inch as roads here are a complete mess sometimes.Also all have glass roof and didn't wanted as our plan is to keep the car over 10 years and all the cars with glass roof will be eventually 'flooded' after some years.The hook in the back was needed also (for some Thule device for bicicles) and none from the stock got it.The only real option for me was to order one in production and to wait.","February 22, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi 1st Maserati.Not Good News 😒To be honest I'm at my whits end and just about had enough now. The 8th Delivery date supposedly the beginning of this week never happened, no car arrived at the dealers, despite Maserati saying it had left the factory. My dealers are just as annoyed apparently and at a loose end as to what is actually going on. Iv'e been waiting over two days now for an update on current situation as is my dealer also, no response from Maserati as of yet. This really has gone beyond a joke now and is absolutely diabolical customer service and relations on Maserati's behalf, even my dealers are now lost for words as they can only inform me what Maserati tell them, and obviously what they have told me so far and the numerous delivery dates over the last six months has left them embarrassed and with much egg on their face. Time to look at other options out there now I think, there is only so much S--T, crap and lies one can take.","February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Further to above. Just had an update. Maserati have reluctantly just informed my dealer that all Grecale's were held back at the factory and none were actually dispatched. Apparently they have a software issue and won't release any Grecale's until they have sorted the problem, as it has to be done manually to each car and can't be done over the air, (suggests different parts fix to me) So basically anyone out there waiting for a car from factory will have a delay (so I'm informed), no time scale for this has yet been given. Maserati are obviously playing cloak and dagger and keeping issues hidden as best they can, but obviously there is only a limited time they can hide things especially if no cars are being released from factory. The wait goes on 😠 and I also can't wait for the next excuse for none delivery of my car, Iv'e had so many, surely there can't be any left in the book to quote.","February 23, 2023"
Tony Mac,Shocking EDZ - I couldn’t have waited this long 😞,"February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi TonyTo be honest if I had been told I would be waiting over a year for the car when ordering it, I may have looked else where then. The trouble is that Maserati have been playing me along, each time a delivery date arrives it's not met and I'm given another delivery date which is normally only a few weeks later, so I hold fire as most new cars at present are taking around six months. If we all had crystal balls I'm sure we would all do things differently, but life at present is so unpredictable. Do hope your car is going well and you are still enjoying it.All the best.","February 23, 2023"
Tony Mac,"You are stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I’m sure it will be truly worth the stress and frustration of waiting.In December 2022 we were considering a Mecan / Cayenne and the build wait was 12+ months.Still enjoying our Modena, only done 350 miles - no issues to report🤞","February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Glad to hear your still enjoying your car Tony and all is going well.Yes my last few cars have taken 12+ months to arrive including my current Macan GTS, but I'm told that at the outset and they have pretty much arrived as told. The difference here is Maserati told me 6 months and I'm nearly a year (give or take a few weeks) in and still waiting, that's the frustrating part. If you are told delivery time when ordering you accept or reject that time and work to those times, give or take a month. Maserati have not been up front with information or kept me informed from the outset, diabolical customer service and relations and I thought Porsche were bad 🤣The best of this is: I had an email direct from Maserati back in July 2022 welcoming me to the family and informing me my car was in build and should be with me very soon 😱 from then on they went into hiding 👻","February 23, 2023"
edit,"@EDZI was thinking this morning regarding your situation.Maybe Maserati delivered the car actually and maybe your car has technical problems and in fact is in the dealer warehouse trying to fix it.If your car was at Maserati factory with some issues, it is impossible to not have the technical knowledge or resources to fix it. They are delivering cars on daily basis to all the corners of the world. So, what are the reason to not replace quarter of your car, if needed and to deliver the car, if the car is still at the factory?If your car is at the dealer and the dealer is lying to you, the repairs are more difficult via air at the dealer and always the dealer needing to have maserati mails and sugestions.If I was you, I will visit the dealer without telling him upfront and tell that you want to search the car in the back warehouse/garage to be sure that they are playing wright with you as the trust regarding them is lost. They have to demonstrate you this is the reality and they don't have the car in pieces somewhere. do not leave until you inspect the dealer and do not give them time to hide the car.My dealer told me they will deliver my Modena in 3-4 months calculating from the downpayment.","February 24, 2023"

Just as Maserati is getting great press and Stelantis looks like really re-polishing the brand (look at the Granturismo) and trying to push itself into the space where others have been so successful (i.e. Porsche and the Macan), it is simply mind boggling that situations like this (no one can track your primaserie order?????) can happen.If the entire customer experience sucks, then the brand suffers.Pure speculation, but maybe things with the UK dealer and Maserati Italy are not as good as they appear and that is the root cause? So there is a problem that you are not seeing or privy to. What is weird is that you had several promises of delivery with a date. Either this was the dealer plucking it out of thin air to placate you or how else can that be explained.

Firstly the car has been found, so Wally has not got it 🤣 It's built and has a VIN number sitting in a warehouse at the factory awaiting dispatch. No Grecale's have left the factory for over six weeks now apparently, all on hold due to updates etc on software. Apparently it is actually illegal for them to release cars knowing they have issues or faults to correct, hence the sudden stop on dispatch over six weeks ago. I'm so far told that release should finally start happening very, very soon and my car should be in the UK by end of March. They have had numerous problems with the paint, parts and building the my car due to it's very top end spec etc. Iv'e had apologies from several people in Maserati and awaiting a final phone call, as to what they intend to do to make up for it and that the car has been released and on route to UK.

1stMaserati,Great news@EDZ!!!!!As an aside… What does this all mean for us on the road in a Grecale? Is there a recall wave coming for all of us with software updates? Funnily I was the the dealer today (less than 3 km from home and next to the petrol station I normally use) as I knew the new Granturismo arrived. They did not mention any software recall for delivered cars.As for the Granturismo… easy on the eyes is all I can say!,"March 17, 2023"

UKTrofeo,One other point to note is that the screws that Maserati supplies to fix the rear number plate to the rear plate holder are too long and therefore go into the paintwork causing damage. This was spotted by my ppf installer and fully rectified by my dealer free of charge. The dealer checked their other Grecales and ALL of them had damaged paintwork as a result of the long screws. Once rectified and the ppf installed I binned the rear number plate holder and just installed the rear number plate with thick double sided sticky foam pads. (The sticky pads would adhere to the rear number plate holder securely!!),"April 3, 2023"
UKTrofeo,Not cheap. About £5k including full paintwork detail,"April 3, 2023"
UKTrofeo,But apart from the number plate issue and the tracker fob triggering alerts even when the fob is in the car (this has stopped happening now so maybe a software update was done) the car has been wonderful (now done about 1500 miles),"April 3, 2023"
EDZ,Thanks for the pointer UKTrefeo 👍Will have a word with the detailer before undertaking.Pleased to read things have and are good with your Trefeo.,"April 3, 2023"
Tony Mac,"ThanksWe had the same issue with the Tracker Fob for the first week after taking delivery. Leaving the Security Fob in a coat pocket placed on the rear seat or in wife’s handbag, triggered alerts and phone calls.Vodafone got quite annoyed and said take it out of the leather Maserati pouch - we ignored this. But started placing the Key + Fob in the central cup-holder, which stopped the alerts.Dealer said it shouldn’t be an issue leaving the Fob in the pouch, so long as it was in the car.Will experiment placing it in ‘other’ places to see if this has been fixed.","April 3, 2023"
edit,"So, my downpayment was on 22nd of february and the dealer called me today to say the production time is week 16, so starting with 17th of April. I will have my Modena on week 19 so no later than 12th of MayGood news","April 4, 2023"
Dai Uy Ted,"I recently asked the dealer when my order might be acknowledged by Maserati. They couldn't guess, because at this point the car would be a MY 2024. Since we don't know the pricing, or what colors/options might be offered then, I started looking at alternatives. Decided on a used Levante, letting first owner absorb the depreciation.

EDZ,"Hi edit.What you should bare in mind is ! One of the majority reasons owners join any forum is the fact they have a problem or issue with their car and start to do internet research, this happens with every manufacturer. Just look at how many have joined this site recently for that very reason, because they have an issue or want to air their anger at the manufacturer. So you will always see and read many issues with cars on forums in the early days/months/years of release, but a good platform for such. Once the membership grows over the years and the car gets known these will become less. Considering how many cars are made or have been made, a forum is not really a place to get best averages, owner members probably only make up aprox 30% of this site. I feel for everyone that has issues or problems but there is also many out there including myself that so far have had no problems whatsoever with the car and probably many more of those that are not forum members. Some of the issues I have read have also been due to owners not even understanding their own car as of yet, covered in the hand book or something not even spected on purchase, and some are just niggles they don't like, just as you get with every different make of car. And some issues derive from poor dealer backup, know-how and after care, many of whom really don't know the Grecale as of yet and are more interested in sales (profit margins).Looking forward to your pic's on collection, which sounds like it's not far off.","May 6, 2023"

WarrenB,"While I agree in principal, the issues raised on this forum show a trend which is helpful in diagnosing issues. My car has many of the key and key beeps issues a lot of others have raised which I have fed into my service center to help resolve the issues and what it does highlight is that it’s a systemic problem rather an isolated problem with my car. It’s been in the service center for 3 weeks now and Maserati are trying to resolve the issues remotely without any luck so far.The number of different issues does show the lack of testing done and I get the impression that Maserati rushed the car out to get ahead of the launch of the new Cayenne and Macan updates. I didn’t spend $100k to be a beta tester.","May 12, 2023"

However, I'm uncertain if these accounts accurately reflect the experiences of all owners or if they represent a minority who encountered unfortunate circumstances with their models. What are your thoughts? If given the chance to reconsider, would you still choose to purchase the Grecale?My primary concerns revolve around reliability problems and potential depreciation, particularly in comparison to other Maserati models. I'm open to tolerating minor software-related inconveniences.","June 12, 2023"

Synapse,"Hi@Shouliop1, welcome! I've had the car since Feb and love it! There are some minor annoyances and peculiarities, as with any new vehicle loaded with this many options. None are in my opinion dealbreakers or anything that would cause me even a moment of regret. Many of the complaints I've seen come down to what you are looking for in a vehicle. If you are very particular about the user experience of every bit of tech included then I would say spend some time with the car before you buy. For me all the ADAS, warning aids and accompanying beeps etc are unnecessary even though I have the options included. There is a high degree of software configurability and basically any feature that isn't important or doesn't quite work the way I like, I simply turn it off. Same goes for the issues others are having because they have chosen to set the horn to sound each time the vehicle locks/unlocks. It's not a necessary feature in my opinion and I don't use it because I can actually hear the locking mechanism actuate and at least for my car, the mirrors will auto fold when locking. Maybe future software updates will improve upon some features I've chosen to disable and when it is eventually to my satisfaction, I'll use it. Either way I'm happy with my purchase because what I value most is how it drives, the design details (which are best in class) and if I'm being honest, I don't mind that extra bit of prestige that comes with the Maserati marquee.","June 2, 2023"

They have a long list of Ferraris needing to be serviced and the Grecale’s are using up all the space.

Mikeinyorks,"Love the performance and the handling. Interior is great. No mechanical issues. Modena Prima Series, delivered 4 April 2023, and now done over 2,000 miles. This is a U.K. car. Previous car was a Porsche Cayenne. No issues!But having had cars with so few issues this one is getting irritating. Convinced it is software related. Not done a journey without some issue. As said notmechanical.justshouldn’t happen.I have paid for functions that don’t work as intended. Hit and miss.Satnav fails and reboots. Looses traffic, and doesn’t return unless you stop and restart. Speed limits are wrong most times! camera relies on satnav at times when it hasn’t read a road sign ( apparently). One direction it says 20mph ( never been 20mph!) and the other direction is 60mph which is correct.Not convinced air con and cooled seats work properly all the time.Constantly getting texts and calls from Vodafone about the tracker. Key fob not found is another issue. Which requires stopping and restarting.Screen has a mind of its own.Surrounded cameras work intermittently. View isn’t great when they do work.But I also now worry about other not obvious functions that may not be working due to software limitations. These could be safety related.My car was delayed, waiting for software updates! Seems they are still an issue. Going in for a few days to be checked in a couple of weeks. Earliest the dealer can do, as due to distance, I need a courtesy car. Let’s see…I used this forum to see if others have similar experiences. There could be a simple fix. And hope that Maserati read and see what needs to be done to make the car great.Some seem to have minimal issues and/or accept and turn off functionality ( if I have paid extra for a function, I expect it to work), or have major issues. I’m in the middle. Annoying issues, that unnecessarily soil the overall experience.","June 4, 2023"
WarrenB,"Agreed but not ideal especially in US cities like Atlanta that are noisy where you can’t hear the click. The mirror fold is a sign but an issue if they are already folded. My issue is that I can’t even get to the petrol tank to open it without the car locking itself let alone getting to the pump. 9/10 times I can’t open the boot/trunk as the kick sensor beeps 2 twice and does nothing and the button doesn’t work as the car isn’t seeing the key when standing there. The front doors sometimes just won’t open too and you have to use the physical key buttons.What issues did you have?

Americans are very conditioned to getting exactly what they paid for and are very demanding when that doesn’t happen which is why there are really strong consumer protection laws and state laws like the Lemon Law here which I’m going through now.Maserati NA have acknowledged they are having more issues than expected and my dealer for one is also frustrated as their feeling is that the cars are not being thoroughly tested before delivered and they are stuck dealing with the issues.The Grecale is Maserati’s push into more mass market appeal and they need to rid the brand of its poor reliability perceptions to be successful and this launch isn’t helping.,"June 4, 2023"

Sitting behind a arctic truck with 4-6 cars behind it all in front of you, all pondering if they have enough power to overtake the arctic truck (hesitating), with that better power output BHP you can over take much easier and make progress, whilst the others are still stuck behind.","May 12, 2023"
Synapse,My Modena is getting 17.4mpg while 100% city driving (lots of rush hour). I've been pretty gentle on the throttle as I'm still under 1000km. Mostly in Comfort mode and no auto start/stop (that feature stopped working and I don't miss it at all 😆).,"May 14, 2023"

Synapse,"Out of curiosity I looked a bit into why the auto start stop seemed to be disabled all the time (on the dash display there is a symbol indicating it is not on). If you usually drop your hood and let it slam shut this probably does not affect you. However, I have a habit (from owning other cars with an aluminum hood) where I close the hood by lowering it slowly and then pressing down until it latches. There is a sensor which apparently did not detect the hood is fully closed and that is why the auto start/stop was disabled. Strangely, there is no warning light on the dash showing the sensor did not detect full closure. The door/hood open warning light only illuminates if you don't press down on the hood and actuate the mechanical latch. In my situation the mechanical latch was engaged and therefore no warning light.","May 18, 2023"
Geoff,"I don't drive my car too much but 15 miles x galon for a 2 liters engine is crazy. I had a 5.6 V8 and fuel consumption was 14 driving in the city. I'll wait for the engine to have more miles, maybe is too new.","May 18, 2023"
Synapse,I would think the main constraint to fuel efficiency probably comes down to weight and how the engine is tuned to deliver performance. Reducing the displacement to a 2.0 can only get you so far in terms of fuel savings if you still want it to drive like a Maserati.,"May 19, 2023"

Locking and unlocking with the keyless entry is hap hazard.2. Touching the door handle every if the car is unlocked results in beeping. It sometimes beeps over 6 timeswhen touching.3. getting out of the car and walking to the passenger door on the drivers side will result in the door locking.4.Even though the software is set to open all doors on key push, it only opens the front doors. I think the keyless entry doesn’t unlock the car when approaching it and you have to touch the front door to open the back doors.For this kind of money and functionality that just works in Toyotas or Honda’s, they have to fix it.

You click the key to open the front and back doors which gives 2 beeps. Each of the front door passengers touch the door handles and they both beep twice so that now 6 beeps in total.Even just a driver who wants to put shopping in the back means either clicking the key or touching the handle, then opening the back and then getting into the car which is another 2 beeps so 4 in total.I’ve never known a car to do this.

italia,"Sorry you're having issues@WarrenB.I'm 48 hours into my Grecale Trofeo ownership with no issues. A couple of things I've learned about new cars and motorcycles is that they have VERY high parasitic drain on the installed battery. Thus, while the car is in stock at the dealer on the lot, the battery is draining. It's not unusual for a battery to be just strong enough to start at the dealer, but will not fully recharge through the alternator charging system on the way home. Thus, the first stop at a gas station or at home renders the battery too weak to start the next time unless properly charged, or it presents low voltage to the vehicle's electronics which can be quite troublesome to sensors, settings, etc. Unfortunately, car and motorcycle dealers almost never do a complete initial charge to a battery before delivery. That battery ""initiation charge"" is one key to long term battery health, and proper electrical support of vehicle electronics.So, doing my own charge on Day 1 of ownership is a habit I have formed. I have six Deltran Battery Tender Plus units for motorcycles and a garage-queen car, so it was easy for me to add the battery tender pigtail to the Grecale battery and connect it to the Deltran unit (a ""Smart"" tender) for a complete charge, which ended up taking nearly 11 hours. You can use a regular 2A/10A/70A charger and set it at 10A for a quicker charge, but a Smart tender works well unattended and will cease trickle when the battery is fully charged.Given the evidently high parasitic drain on the Grecale battery, I intend to put in on a tender any time I'm not driving it for a week. My six (Grecale will be seventh) battery tenders are connected to a power strip that is plugged into a wifi plug with a scheduler. I run the battery tenders on a schedule of 18 hours, twice a week. Several of my vehicles also have very high parasitic battery drain.Regarding your issues:1) I'm not sure if my wireless charging is working or not - haven't checked - do you have to turn on wireless charging in a menu?2) The stereo sounds good. I did notice that when a Waze direction comes on and interrupts the music, it returns to music on the right channel a second or so before the left channel. I think that happens in one of my other cars too so it may be more Apple Carplay related.3) The doors seem to lock and unlock fine using both keys, and the mirrors seem to fold when locked, so I guess that's all working. I don't think it beeps at me but if I check the door when the key is away from the car, the door is locked. The door did unlock once by grabbing the handle with the key in my pocket, so I guess that is working.4) Boot kick sensor - can't imagine ever using that but sounds kinda fun. I guess.5) My experience is that door rattles are the easiest for dealers to troubleshoot.6) Batteries. There's just too much tech and too many sensors running all the time on new cars and motorcycles. I know some people are not in favor of using battery tenders, but they prevent the type of voltage drops that can cause issues with computers, ECUs, and flash memory /chip storage in cars with high battery parasitic loss. Voltage drops or improperly initiated batteries can cause a vehicle to have ongoing issues with retaining settings and operating electronic functions properly. Many issues that people think are sensor problems are the result of voltage drops. Even if the car is able to start, the battery may be presenting low voltage to the sensors and electronics when the car is off.And if I haven't convinced you yet to the benefits of smart battery tenders, I usually get 6-7 years of life out of new lead acid, AGM or lithium car / motorcycle battery using battery tenders on a regular schedule.One of my early impressions: I took it for an 80 mile drive this morning. The Trofeo's ""Sport"" mode has a very slight intrusion that you can feel in the steering response, even when traversing a fairly easy corner. I would have expected the intrusion to be felt only when tire grip necessitated. The Corsa mode, however, has no intrusion and thus the steering feels much more natural. I'm sure I'll post other impressions as I go along.Good luck sorting your issues.","June 21, 2023"

italia,"@edit. Thanks for your reply. I'm quite a bit older than you, and have driven more miles and (probably) owned more motorcycles and cars than you. But this is not a pissing match right.?That said, in recent years, the number of drains on a battery when the car is not in use is not comparable to most cars older than 5-6 years. A 2017 BMW may not be comparable in parasitic drain to some newer cars. Anyway, believe what you want, but parasitic drain is a thing. Some vehicles have very little parasitic drain - others have considerable drain. Good luck with your experiences and assumptions.","June 21, 2023"
Tony Mac,"I have to agree with@edit- These new cars should NOT need trickle chargingOur Modena often sits for a 7+ days between journeys, without any battery charging or failure issues.Back in early May the local dealer installed a Software Update, which I was told, primarily addressed excessive battery discharge","June 21, 2023"
italia,"@Tony MacI totally agree that batteries shouldn't NEED trickle charging. And 7+ days SHOULD be easily achieved by any healthy, well initiated battery. I have 3 other cars (2015-2020 models) that all have sat for a few weeks without a battery issue.Unfortunately, it's not always the case in that some new cars (and motorcycles) have high enough parasitic drain, and combined with poorly initiated batteries, there can be issues. I have one '20 car and a few motorcycles that cannot sit for a few weeks without issue. The manufacturers of them actually ship battery tenders with the vehicles. LOLEven my Maserati dealer warned me not to let my Grecale sit for more than 2-3 weeks without being driven or on a battery tender.Hopefully those software updates make it easier for all of us to maintain battery health. Sounds like they found some systems that had high parasitic drain issues and resolved them by having software control demand when car is not in use.This might be interesting reading for some:What is 'Normal' for Parasitic Draw?","June 21, 2023"

adamb,"Hi Everyone!I live in the UK (London), and I've had a Grecale Modena (fully specced out) since Jan this year, and have come across some of these issues, so just wanted to weight in as well! 😀Apologies for the lengthy response below - I've tagged people so you don't have to read it all if you don't want to! 😅In response to OP (@seattlejanzen):I have to turn my infotainment system on manually pretty much all the time, except when I briefly stop somewhere (say while buying petrol) - I suspect that there's a grace period where it just comes back on right away, but otherwise needs to be started manually, and of course thelegaleseaccepted (pretty odd design, and the first car I've encountered this).If you mean having to accept the same legalese multiple times, I just reckon the screen isn't always responsive, and also has little tolerance for being imprecise when pressing a button (I encountered this in other parts of the MIA as well)I've had the exact the same problem, and it was driving me crazy! 😂 The music would skip for a split second about every 10-20 seconds, and sometimes for a whole second or two when doing certain operations (changing screen in the MIA, scrolling lists, etc.). I spent way too much time investigating this, and what I found is that it only seems to affect CarPlay (I didn't have an Android phone to test with), and it doesn't make a difference whether you use wired or wireless CarPlay. All other sources were unaffected (Radio, Bluetooth, USB). Ultimately I've raised this with my dealer, and Maseratireleased a software update which fixed the problem. However when the service installed this, it effectively broke my navigation, so be careful before you jump on the update bandwagon (more details on this further below).Yes, I don't believe the MIA has the ability to recognise your phone as a USB music player - it only supports plugging in a USB storage device to read music files off of. However, what you can do is connect your phone as a bluetooth audio source instead - all you have to do is once your phone is connected to the car, go into the Device Manager in the menus, and you'll see three icons: Phone, Music, CarPlay. The third one should be currently selected if you're using CarPlay, but if you click the Music icon, it will disconnect CarPlay and use your phone as an audio source instead. You'll still be able to use the play/pause/next/previous buttons on the MIA to control the audio, but you'll have to select tracks/playlists via your phone screen instead.Sorry I can't help with this one - I've left that option enabled on mine!In response to@Mikeinyorks:I haven't had the door opening issue you describe, however I do have a frequent problem with the car not detecting my fob even though it's inches away in my pocket, and I have to put my hand on the latch a few times to work. FYI I have my car set up to open all doors when the fob is pressed, instead of just the driver's door - not sure if that makes a difference, but just throwing it out there...Haven't come across the volume going silent, but I also don't use the Radio, so it might be specific to that...I live in West London and drive to Central once a week, and I've found the traffic info fairly reliable so far around here (often pretty close to Waze), but I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't universally the case in all locations - whereabouts do you live, if you don't mind me asking?If you mean the popup keeps showing, I think that's an annoying side effect of how many wireless chargers work - my solution was to turn off the popup, so now the car only shows the charging indicator in the digital clock screen. You can disable the main screen popup in the car Settings, underNotification > Wireless Charger Status Popups.In response to@Tony Mac:I've had loads of problems with the security fobs, where the car kept triggering false alarms with Vodafone because it couldn't see them. I've raised this with Maserati and after some servicing it seems to have been resolved; it's worth noting that I've also had to get both security fobs replaced eventually (even though I've put fresh batteries in them first), but now the last time I spoke to Vodafone and we re-synced the fobs, they both started working. 🎉 As a side note I used to have a Porsche Macan with Vodafone tracking as well, and never had an issue, plus the car would also tell me if it couldn't see the fob (I forgot to turn it on), or if the battery was running low; once when talking to Vodafone, the CS agent mentioned that Porsches are the only cars which give you actual feedback on the tracking system, and also that recent Maseratis use an updated tracking system, which has been causing a lot of similar issues to mine for owners...Regarding the ""speed limit"", do you mean the speed limit detected on the current road, and the limit set via the Speed Limiter functionality? Either way, both of those should be visible in the HUD (should be standard on the Modena): I think the current speed limit is visible even in ""Simple"" mode, whereas the Speed Limiter (and other driving assist info) is visible via the ""Advanced"" mode - you can change this in settings, underDisplay > Head Up Display > HUD Content.In response to@Synapse:#8: This happened to me once, and I've been paranoid ever since! 😅 For the record I approached the car from the passenger side, grabbed the handle, saw the lights flash and heard the door unlock, but when I opened the door the alarm went off; had to use the key fob to silence it. Hasn't happened since, but now I always wait a couple of seconds after grabbing the handle and seeing the lights flash, just in case...#10: I wonder whether this is due to the ""Auto-On Radio"" function, which I believe is set to ""ON"" by default - I've set mine to ""OFF"" and never had the problem you describe. You can find it in the car settings, underAudio > Auto-On Radio.Now, for my part, as I mentioned above I've had a software update installed by Maserati which resolved some of my issues (including the music skipping with CarPlay), however for some reason it came bundled with the ""South America, Oceania, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific"" map package, which renders the navigation effectively useless - some major motorways are visible, but otherwise nothing else in London... I spoke to the dealer, who spoke to Maserati, and now they came up with another software update to potentially fix this - it's just been released a couple of days ago, so hopefully I can get it updated in the coming week and report back. 🙂I've also asked about remote updates, but was told the major updates have to be done at the service; as a side note the Grecale documentation in general is really rather poor, with many functions having zero explanation (like the Wi-Fi software update), or not being mentioned at all (like the gesture controls for the climate control).Finally, just to pile on, I have the following issues which others haven't yet mentioned:Car only remembers the volume settings for music, but not for notifications and navigation announcements, which revert back to 15 (quite loud) every time I turn the car on.CarPlay doesn't connect when there's no phone signal, say in an underground garage; however it's worth noting that I've had the same issue in my Porsche Macan, so it may be some weird bug in CarPlay itself, rather than in the Grecale...When I turn the wheel all the way to the left or right (full lock) manoeuvring at low speed, I get some vibrations coming through the chassis and the steering wheel; it almost feels like the tires rubbing against the chassis, but it's definitely not the case. It also seems more pronounced after I start the car, and maybe less so after having driven for some time, but I haven't tested it enough. I've raised this with the service who looked at it and said that this was typical for this model and that it was fine. Has anyone else encountered this? This is the first car where I've come across such a behaviour, so it seems a bit odd...Thanks,Adam","April 19, 2023"

Tony Mac,"Hi Adam,Thanks for taking the time to reply to all of the issues being reported - really helpful and appreciated.Starting with your comments about theSteering Vibrationsat low speed on full-lock. Sounds like we get the same sensation, but only when it's cold and on a smoothish surface. To me it feels like a very light judder. My guess is this is the Akerman Affect that other sports cars suffer from - I'm told it's common on Porsche's. We previously had a MB GLC and this suffered from shockingly bad Crabbing and Juddering during the winter monthsSecurity Fob- We haven't received any recent calls from Vodafone, so assuming the Security Fob is working. Assuming things are working typically results in failure, so will take the car out without the Fob to check if we get a call??Road Speed Signs- Referring to the Speed limit detected on the Current road - with Level 1 it uses the GPS location, not camera sign recognition. This works pretty well but the Speed Sign shown on the Main screen is difficult to see without moving my Left hand. This Speed sign isn't being shown on the HUD - will take a look at the options - Thanks for this information. The Warning Beep when exceeding the speed limit is useful, but far too loud.In my opinion the Indicator noise is also too loud and sounds awfulKeyless Entry- Also having issues with this. Rarely works the way it should. Walking towards the car and the small coloured lights in the headlights come on ( switched off the annoying Beep ), so you would assume the doors can be opened. But frustratingly the doors are still locked, typically taking 2 or 3 attempts to open the door.Other issuesLights and Computer switched onafterLocking and Leavingthe car on a car park. A friend came and warned me the lights and computer were on, even though I had 100% switched the ignition off and locked the car as usual??Main Screen gets confusedand reverts back to the wrong menu option.

The setting is ‘Auto Door Lock’ but now looking closer atyeah, however, in looking at that setting closer i mistakenly thought that was the setting that locks the doors when you leave.

Examples are zoomable and side view surround view cameras where the image brightness, contrast etc can be set. Self parking and self reverse out of parking which we don’t have. Just 2 examples. The reason we are experiencing these issues is it’s Maserati’s first entry into the world of tech at the level of their competitors and I just don’t think they tested enough before releasing the car. I’m guessing they needed another 6 months to a year of testing but were forced to release it with the new Cayenne coming and the updates the the Mercedes GLC.","May 7, 2023"

edit,"What EDZ wanted to say with the car is full of technology was the car is full of displays and no physically buttons at all, probably.My story is I waited for the new GLC Coupe almost 12 months to be released.In January beeing enough waiting, I was having a look on the Grecale.The down payment was on 22nd of February and the GLC coupe was released on 15th of March. Mercedes where accepting orders shorthly after.So, having Grecale against the GLC means for me as technical features:Less technically advance lightingNo rear wheels steeeringMecanically deployed towing hitch and no electricNo rear side airbags (only courtain for the back)No Ionisation for the ACNo real ambient lighting. New GLC coupe have many colours to choose from and more advance lines and shapesNo driving front camera that can record on the internal HDDNo spare wheelLess advance 360 parkingThis is technically.But there is also:Smaller warrantyLess reliability not only in theory. The stress that we will be somewhere hundreds or 1000-2000km away from home and the car to refuse to work is fantasticThe don't know how to fix of the dealer and also of the producerMore fuel consumption due to Jeep outdated engine fitted on my carHigher cost of the annual maintenance (oil, filters and so on)Higher cost of the parts that needs to be changed after some time as a normal result of the wear and tearThe cost of the repaires after the warranty will be no longer valid. Our plan is to keep this car verry, very long time (at least 10 years). I'm already settled I will have 1-2-3 invoices close or even exceeding 10.000 euros each for repairs during this years.Higher cost of the insurance.","May 13, 2023"
WarrenB,"I agree with you EDIT. The car has nothing new other than one additional screen. My 2017 Ghibli SQ4 has almost all the same functionality and settings as the Grecale but just on a smaller screen with lower resolution. The only thing it doesn’t have is the 360 camera.I accepted that the German cars have a lot more functionality and better implementations of the same (360 cameras is one example)but I bought the Maserati for its great design and uniqueness on the road and for that I was prepared to pay a significantly higher price point for arguably less as you have to measure its price point against 6 cylinder equivalents. With this much higher total cost of ownership in mind, I expect everything to work. A key and keyless entry system that doesn’t work which has resulted in my car being in the service center for 21 days and still counting is unacceptable. The dealer and Maserati Italy have spent 3 weeks and cannot find a solution And when I ask what the plan is or when they expect to have a solution, I just get a shrug of the shoulders and the proverbial “we don’t know”.","May 13, 2023"

adamb,"Hi Everyone! Sorry about the (very) late response, I didn't get notified by the site about new replies to this thread... 🙄Updates on my car since my last post:Navigation:The car was taken in for another software update, which resolved the issue with the incorrect maps being loaded in the nav system; Apple CarPlay audio still works correctly, so there were no regressions after the update.Vodafone Tracker:As of about a week ago, my Vodafone tracker once again started raising false alarms; it's been pretty consistent in not detecting a fob at all in the car (even if I took it out of my pocket and put it on the centre console). I spoke with the dealership, and I was told that a lot of people have been having this problem, and that Maserati has now identified a problem with the antenna used to detect the card; they are currently working on a new design for the hardware, and once ready will roll it out to existing vehicles. There are no set timelines, but his best estimate was that this wouldn't be ready for at least a couple of months.However, I was also told that Maserati advised thatplacing the tracker fob in the rear seating area can resolve the issue. I have tested this today, and getting into the car on three separate occasions, I haven't received a false alert once (fingers crossed it continues to work). It is of course pretty awkward to have to put the card in the back each time (and to make sure you don't forget it), so I'm working on a little DIY solution to make it more manageable.","May 22, 2023"
adamb,"Hi@Tony Mac! Sorry about the (very) late response!Steering Vibrations:Thanks, that's very interesting! I haven't heard of the Ackermann Effect before, but reading about it now it all makes perfect sense! So basically it's a tradeoff whereby you get better handling at high speed, but get some of this judder during tight turns at low speed - I can live with that (it's not too bad anyway). I had a Porsche Macan before and I don't recall having the same problem, but maybe it was just subtle enough for me to ignore it.Security Fob:Interesting you haven't had any problems - lucky you I guess! 😉 As per my previous post above, there's definitely a design flaw in the hardware, and I got the impression there are a decent number of people having issues...Lights and computer stays on:If you mean the interior lights, it definitely seems like if you switch any of them on via the buttons above the rear view mirror, they stay on even after locking and leaving (I haven't had it happen while leaving it on auto). As for the computer, I have the ""Radio Off with Door"" option enabled (you can change this in Settings underAudio > Radio Off with Door), so it always turns off as soon as I open the car door (and the ignition is off). I might try turning the option off to see what happens. I also wonder if it would eventually switch off for you once the time in ""Radio Off Delay"" has passed (underKey Off Optionsin the Settings). Reading the manual (page 127) for that option, I also get the impression that what you're experiencing might be the intended behaviour, but it's unclear - either way it's not great...Navigation Zoom:I'm with you on this - manually zooming via the small touch buttons on the left (far) side of the screen is pretty inconvenient while driving, and the auto-zoom feature is pretty poor - no matter which setting I use (zoom in at junction, zoom based on road type), it always seem to just stay roughly at the same (close) zoom level, and never zooms out (even if there's no upcoming turn for 10+ miles).Brakes:I get a bit of squeaking when I'm slowly releasing the brakes from a complete stop (for example while manoeuvring during parking), but otherwise I haven't come across any noise like the examples you mention.","May 22, 2023"

Sorry about the (super) late response!#3 As per my post above, I've had another software update installed, and now both the MIA navigation and CarPlay are working as expected (also haven't spotted any new issues for now). I'm also a heavy Waze user, but I also really like being able to see the map and directions in the instrument cluster and on the HUD. Apple was showing off a future version of CarPlay a little while back which would be able to integrate with additional displays in the car, but I'd imagine it's going to be a long time before that makes its way into the mainstream (and probably wouldn't be back-ported to existing models).Being able to lock your keys in the car sounds pretty concerning - lucky you had a spare close by! 😅 I also have the app installed as well, so it's good to know I can reach for that if this ever happens...","May 22, 2023"

Tony Mac,"Adding to EDZ’s postWe haven’t had any battery issues with our Grecale - it’s typically stationary for 3 to 10 days between trips, but never any issues.Having said the above - last week the car was at the dealers for a Software Update. That I was told addresses Battery problems 👍The sensors for Keyless entry and Tracking were moved to hopefully resolve the issues we were seeing. These changes appear to have fixed the Keyless entry niggle.Asked the dealer to investigate the squeaky brakes at low speed - they said this is normal behaviour?Reading about the Beeping other owners report, when opening the car - we don’t see / hear this problemMPG - averaging 29 mpg and no complaints with this. Bought a Maserati for its stylish looks and excellent performance from a 2L engine. If high mpg is a key requirement, maybe the Grecale isn’t the right choice. Tested the motorway mpg while driving for a long distance at 50 mph and the mpg is easily returning 35 mpg - but not much fun 👍","May 22, 2023"

1stMaserati,Hi EDZ! Nice to meet you as well! Sorry should have sent a message in new owners section ;-) When is your delivery planned? We don't regret the change from the Macan!!!TF007 I will ask the dealer and see what they say. Our other car is a Taycan and the phone charger works well in the sense that it will always find and charge your phone. The problem with all these wireless chargers is that they produce a lot of heat if you are not perfectly over the charging area and can overheat your phone (hence why Apple created a magnet based system). Kind of a shame that you have to go back to a cable to charge in the Grecale as the location is perfect -- but not perfect if adding a cable is needed :-(,"November 15, 2022"

TF007,"Last Friday I picked up my new Maserati Grecale Modena at the dealer. The handover was great and I was stunned by the vehicle in real life. I am impressed in all aspects with this beautiful vehicle.My impressions so far:LookSubjective, but for me the most beautiful SUV on the market. The car is big, looks massive, but is still a tad smaller than a full-size SUV (X5, GLE, Q7). It looks sporty, but is very elegant at the same time. It has a coupe-like design, but you still sit high up, as you would expect in an SUV. The details with the Trident, the integrated door handles, the grille or the tailpipes, fit perfectly into the overall picture. The proportions are right. Simply a beautiful car!InteriorYou sit in the driver's seat and it feels like home. The workmanship is simply perfect. Leather everywhere, beautiful little details. Nothing clatters. The seats are very comfortable and can be adjusted in many ways. The headliner is covered with a fine fabric. I don't think it's Alcantara, but it almost seems like it. The panoramic roof lets a lot of light into the interior and the eye-catcher par excellence, are the Sonus Faber speakers. The steering wheel is also leather and is designed to match. The Grecale is on par with the luxury class.InfotainmentThe centerpiece are the new screens with the infotainment system. Here I was concerned that it couldn't keep up with Mercedes and co. I miss nothing! (almost nothing) and some is even better solved. The resolution of the display is high, the colors rich and the touchscreen responds flawlessly. The surround camera also has a good resolution. Automatic parking is not possible with Maserati (a minus point), but otherwise parking with the guide lines and different views is very pleasant.I like the fact that several apps can be displayed next to each other on one screen, e.g. the navigation system and the radio at the same time. The head-up display is large and shows the map as well as the speed.Sonus FaberI was particularly looking forward to this feature. I have the high-premium version. And I have to say, the best I've heard in a car so far. With Spotify as the source (no Lossless) the bass is so crystal clear, the highs and mids are detailed and the 3D soundscape is phenomenal. Songs like Hotel California or Temptation by Diana Krall come out impressively. It's like hearing the song in a new version.Unfortunately, I am missing the TIDAL built-in app (hifi/lossless quality). Maserati has promised to get back to me on this....Driving impressionThe Grecale is a sports car. The steering is precise and the chassis is tightly tuned. It takes curves without wavering. The car feels very agile and it's fun to drive. I have the air suspension. It smooths out long bumps very well. Because of the tight tuning and probably also because of the 21"" rims, the car feels still rather on the harder side. Comfort addicts do probably not get their value here.When cruising, the car is very very quiet (with laminated glass). When accelerating, however, you can clearly hear the sports exhaust system.I have only the 4 cylinder in the Modena. For me, nevertheless, a very good decision. Because you would not suspect one. The car moves nimbly in any situation, and in sport mode you can feel the acceleration. The sound is deep and sonorous. Maserati has really done a good job here.ConclusionA wonderful and great car with few to no weaknesses. I am very happy that I have chosen the Grecale (and left Mercedes behind me)I am also looking forward to your first reports, reviews and questions.","May 21, 2023"
EDZ,"Congratulations, and a great looking combo. Great pics and first impression report, thanks for them 👍 although makes me even more hungry for my one to arrive 😃.

Thanks","October 26, 2022"

And with the Nettuno, the Grecale becomes a real race car...I'm currently observing a steady delivery of all models and I'm sure you'll be able to pick yours up soon.The wearable key is quite nice. The strap is a normal fabric strap, neither specially comfortable, nor uncomfortable.I find it a useful feature, especially when going for swimming in the summer.The battery cannot be changed according to the dealer, but it should last 3 years. But then the whole key must be replaced.","October 26, 2022"

Modenacanada,How is that premium sound system ?,"November 4, 2022"
TF007,"As described in my first conclusion, it's worth every penny. The 3D-sound creates an incredible sound stage. The treble is very clear, you can hear every instrument individually. The bass is undistorted and powerful. I can really highly recommend it.","November 5, 2022"
hicham,"Hello congrats !! Its such a good looking car. As i am about to order the GT version, would love to have your feedback on the overall fuel consumption . Thanks in advance 🙏","November 28, 2022"
TF007,"That's an interesting question. I have only driven just under 2000 kilometers, but I can already see a pattern. On short distances, the consumption is rather high: about 11-12 L. On longer distances with highway and country road, the consumption is with moderate driving at 8.9-9.5 liters. I think it could still go down to 8 liters, driven mostly on the highway. However, with very sporty driving, the fuel tank will be empty very quickly.Conclusion: the Grecale is not really economical, but if you are not always racing, expect consumption for longer distances of around 9 liters. For short trips, you have to accept a consumption well beyond 10/11 liters.","November 28, 2022"
1stMaserati,"Completely agree with@TF007. This is also based on driving less than 2.000 km so far. The one benefit: the Grecale does not need 98, but only 95. I asked the dealer twice and he said 95 is all it needs.","December 2, 2022"
TF007,"Yes 95 is enough, however, the manual says: ""For vehicle top performance, use unleaded gasoline with no less than 98 minimum octane rating.""So I decided to go with that. Maybe marginal difference, but why would they recommend it?","December 4, 2022"

Fabfive,"I have been driving my new Grecale Modena for exactly one week and would like to give my first impressions. Previously, I drove a 2020 BMW X5 30d and was initially very skeptical about making this switch. I consciously chose a sportier alternative without sacrificing a certain level of comfort. As you can imagine, in terms of comfort, it's difficult to compete with an X5...;-). I am impressed by the exterior - the Modena combines elegance, sportiness, and at the same time exudes a touch of hedonism. The interior is impeccable and the craftsmanship down to the smallest detail is simply fantastic. I really didn't expect that. For a four-cylinder, the car drives almost like a six-cylinder, almost because I come from a legendary BMW six-cylinder and you can notice the difference a little bit. However, my negative points are as follows: 1. Autonomous driving: the assistant drives too close to the right lane, and I don't know if this is a mistake that can be corrected with a software upgrade (?) 2. Automatic speed limit takeover is unfortunately not available. Again, the question arises whether this can be added with a software upgrade? 3. Tank volume is too small at 62 liters. 4. In my opinion, the consumption is much too high (currently 12.3 liters per 100 km!) compared to the X5: 9.2 liters per 100 km. 5. There are too many acoustic notifications, some of which you don't know where they are coming from. Other than that, everything is still great so far.","April 12, 2023"
TF007,"Hi@Fabfivetotally agree with you, the engine is really well adjusted and feels great.Let me comment on your points:1. Autonomous driving: the assistant drives too close to the left lane, and I don't know if this is a mistake that can be corrected with a software upgrade (?)That's true, but I haven't found it too irritating so far. Rather annoying I find that the simplest curves the system can't handle.2. Automatic speed limit takeover is unfortunately not available. Again, the question arises whether this can be added with a software upgrade?Also true. I was expecting the feature as well, and according to the package description, it should be available. But it is not...3. Tank volume is too small at 62 liters.Indeed, but that's a silly trend in the entire industry.4. In my opinion, the consumption is much too high (currently 12.3 liters per 100 km!) compared to the X5: 9.2 liters per 100 km.I have an 11.5 average mostly in GT mode, with a lot of short distance rides. Down to 9 is possible with longer steadier trips.5. There are too many acoustic notifications, some of which you don't know where they are coming from. Other than that, everything is still great so far.What bothers me the most is, if you are in autonomous mode, every time when the system stops recognizing the lane, a warning signal sounds. For this reason, you are forced to turn off the system completely within the city limits (back to normal level1 mode), because otherwise the alarm sounds all the time.

And with the Nettuno, the Grecale becomes a real race car...I'm currently observing a steady delivery of all models and I'm sure you'll be able to pick yours up soon.The wearable key is quite nice. The strap is a normal fabric strap, neither specially comfortable, nor uncomfortable.I find it a useful feature, especially when going for swimming in the summer.The battery cannot be changed according to the dealer, but it should last 3 years. But then the whole key must be replaced.View attachment 219View attachment 220Click to expand...Hi, a question on the wearable. I have Vodafone tracker provided, so i guess i need to leave that in the car. Which presumably means i need to take my normal key fob off the keyring as i expect the car will not lock if it is inside?","May 21, 2023"
EDZ,"Finally had news that my Trofeo is in production, current status ""20"", although been at that stage since end of July as factory currently on summer recess. Lets hope things move at a swift pace when the factory starts up again later this month and that they have all the parts required to complete it. Looking forward to its arrival now. 😊","October 28, 2022"
Razbeo,Dealer has told me my Modena is expected around October 12th.,"August 21, 2022"
EDZ,"Congrats, possibly getting our cars around the same time, my dealer is waiting for the factory to reopen to get more of an update.","August 22, 2022"
Razbeo,"I did not know the factory was not open. I was at my dealer a week and a half ago picking up a new Alfa Romeo. At that time dealer told me my car was on the assembly line being built, and gave me a very general estimate of delivery time. Then Saturday the dealer contacted me, and said they had a further update and gave me the October 12th date. I had not contacted them as I did not expect any change in the status so soon.","August 22, 2022"
EDZ,"My dealer contacted me start of August to tell me mine was also in production and not to expect to much more info for a few weeks as they were now closed for their annual holiday until late August. But also said as soon as they return he will keep me informed as to its progress, although apparently progress can be slow sometimes and periods where not much happens, but expected around October delivery.","August 22, 2022"
TF007,"I'm new here on the forum and I'm also one of the lucky buyers of the Maserati Grecale.I chose the Modena, in Grigio Lava with Ghiaccio interior color. 21"" rims are also included (yellow calipers) as well as all the other extras.Before I drove exclusively Mercedes, last the GLC. Actually I was planning to order the newest model. However, I was no longer satisfied with the build quality (a lot of plastic) and the rather marginal design update. It also suddenly felt boring to me.Then the Grecale came along. After the test drive I was completely excited. Finally, real emotions about a car again. No boring colors, a nice sound, a best in class sound system, the wonderful seats and then of course, that elegant and special design, inside and outiside. With the latest infotainment system, it was clear to me to say goodbye to Mercedes and enter the world of Maserati.I ordered mine on July, 26 and the expected delivery date is October, 9.

Nice choice.👍I think those of us that were lucky to get orders in early will start to see them in October and it looks like you may be one of the first 😉Like yourself I was impressed with the Grecale and ordered, well put a holding deposit down first even before the UK launch back at the beginning of April as there was only 10 Trofeo Primaseries coming to the UK. Don't forget to keep us all updated on delivery and obviously a few pic's on collection.","September 9, 2022"
TF007,Thanks for the warm welcome@EDZ! The Trofeo is also no bad choiceSure I will post the latest updates right here. Looking forward to any kind of news.,"September 9, 2022"
TF007,"Any updates from your side yet?I haven't heard anything from my dealer yet and looking at the car brokers in Europe, no one has a Mondena model yet (Only GT/Trofeo).","October 3, 2022"
EDZ,"Hi yaThe last update I had a week or so back was a slight delay in production/delivery. Quoted build completion is now end of October and I should now have my car start of November instead of later this month as originally quoted. There are still no models as of yet in the UK and it appears now the start of November is the due date. I believe it's only the GT and Trefeo Primasirie models arriving as there is no Modena Primaserie coming to UK, that is reserved I believe for the USA market which probably explains your Europe search findings.","October 3, 2022"
TF007,Thanks@EDZI see. I also think that there is a delay. There is still a request pending with my dealer.But I also expect November at the moment. I will keep you posted.,"October 3, 2022"
EDZ,"Thanks,will also keep you posted.","October 3, 2022"
TF007,"If all goes as planned, I'll be picking up my new Grecale next Friday! I'm really looking forward to it and I'm excited. Will then post pictures and my first impression here ...","October 16, 2022"
EDZ,Great news TF007. Do hope all goes to plan for you and looks like you will be one of the first. I'm awaiting feed back from my dealer with regards to mine. look forward to pictures and your first comments. Good luck.,"October 17, 2022"
Modenacanada,Great news. I assume you are in Europe? Any updates for buyers in north America?,"October 21, 2022"
EDZ,Welcome to the forum.I'm from Europe (UK) but have no information on North America. There are a few on the forum with orders and hopefully someone will have a little more news for you. Have you a car on order ?,"October 22, 2022"
Modenacanada,Yes. I ordered a blu intenso Modena launch package. I was told end of October but now that seems very unlikely.,"October 24, 2022"
EDZ,"Nice colour.As I posted above, think everyone with orders is in the same boat. Maserati seem to be a little behind, as unfortunately most manufacturers at present due to the on going semi conductor and parts supply issues. On placing my order back in April it was later confirmed mid to late October delivery but is now looking more like late November, even though I was told my car went into build in August. A friend of mine has a new Macan on order which completed build early September but has been sitting in the dealers compound ever since awaiting for missing parts to be fitted.","October 25, 2022"
Modenacanada,The wait is very tough. It seems that realistically we will be getting our cars in dec or January.,"October 27, 2022"
EDZ,"I'm ok with the wait my last 3 cars have taken between 12 and 18 months to arrive. What I find tough is when you are given a delivery date and it doesn't happen and a few more months are added on when you get very close to the original date given, a little more regular information on progress along the way would be good. Just to be kept in the loop on progress as they say rather than us having to keep contacting the dealer asking and waiting for a response whilst they find out, that's the frustrating tough point to me.","October 28, 2022"
