Mazda 3s,"After months of releasing preview images and several delays, Maserati has introduced the Grecale, its long-awaited entry-level SUV. The sub-Levante model is aimed directly at the Porsche Macan, and it will likely become the firm's best-selling nameplate in the coming years.The latest addition to the Maserati range stretches 191 inches long and 66 inches tall, dimensions that make it about six inches shorter and nearly the same height as the Levante. Visually, it illustrates what Maserati design boss Klaus Busse meant when he told us that future Maserati models would borrow styling cues from the MC20: its front end is defined by a wide grille positioned below a pair of elongated headlights. Viewed from the side, the Grecale leans more toward sportiness than utility, while the back end wears horizontal lights connected by a strip of bright trim. Vents chiseled into the fenders and trident-shaped logos on the C-pillars link the SUV to the rest of the Maserati range. It's a design that works, in our opinion: The Grecale is recognizable as a Maserati but not a copy of an existing model.Busse told us that the idea wasn't merely to Xerox the MC20's front end onto the body of an SUV.""The design philosophy that I laid out in the beginning was actually done before we designed [the MC20 and the Grecale]. We really had to sit down and get our ahead around what we want to do with the next chapter of the brand. The reality is that 70% of the design process is understanding the message that you want to create, and the car then designs itself and the remaining 30% is just putting it on paper. We didn't want to design the car purely for Instagram; end up with a car loaded with real or fake features, lines, and creases. We're very much about purity. Maserati is a very strong performing car, so it doesn't need to shout, ""Hey, look at me!"" Quite the opposite; it wants to be a rolling structure, a car that adds almost visual value to its environment. That's the overreaching philosophy,"" Busse told Autoblog.Inside, Maserati integrated a relatively long list of tech features without making the dashboard look like the automotive equivalent of an iPhone. The driver faces up to four screens: a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the Maserati Intelligent Assistant (MIA) digital instrument cluster, an 8.8-inch touchscreen positioned right below, and a digital clock — yes, that seemingly counts as a screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility come standard, and the list of options includes a 21-speaker Sonus sound system.How the Grecale's cabin is configured depends on the trim level selected. Buyers have several leather upholsteries and trim materials to choose from, including wood and carbon fiber. We're guessing that the Fuoriserie program will provide additional customization options.""It was time to up the game with our interior designs, but also with fit and finish and with technology,"" Busse said. ""Screens were never something that we were known for. And, to be honest, I don't think that we want to be known for screens. Is the industry at peak screen? But, at the end of the day, we also want to reduce the amount of clutter in the car, so the result is what you see here,"" he added.At launch, the Grecale lineup will include three models called GT, Modena, and Trofeo, respectively. The first two trim levels are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine turbocharged to 296 and 325 horsepower, respectively. It develops 332 pound-feet of torque regardless of horsepower. Linked to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the turbo-four spins the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.Enthusiasts will undoubtedly be more interested in the range-topping Trofeo. Instead of a four-cylinder engine, the flagship Grecale gains a version of the twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V6 called Nettuno and borrowed from the MC20 supercar. The six develops 523 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque in this application, and it also sends its power to the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Brembo brakes help keep the extra power in check, and it sounds like they're needed: Maserati pegs the Trofeo's zero-to-60-mph time at 3.6 seconds and its top speed at 177 mph. An air suspension system comes standard on the Trofeo; it's optional on the GT and on the Modena.Pricing for the 2023 Maserati Grecale GT starts at $64,995 including a mandatory $1,495 destination charge, while the Modena Limited Edition (which is only available online and for a short time) carries a base price of $78,895. There's no word yet on how much the Trofeo will cost.Deliveries are scheduled to start in the fall 2022. Looking ahead, the Grecale range will grow with the addition of an electric model (shown in the gallery) that will wear the Folgore nameplate and that's scheduled to reach showrooms before the end of 2023.What's in a name?Historically, Maserati has named many of its cars after winds, and the Grecale is no exception. It borrows its name from a north-easterly Mediterranean wind that's primarily felt on islands like Malta. Levante, Ghibli, Mistral, Bora, and Khamsin are wind names as well.Click to expand...2023 Maserati Grecale revealed with 523-hp twin-turbo V6 - AutoblogThe 2023 Maserati Grecale is positioned as a smaller alternative to the Levante.

Wimbledon,"I like the styling.If the Grecale EV drives anything like a Stelvio, which it should given that it’s on the same platform, this is probably my next car.But I’m waiting for more details on the EV version. Compared to a Model Y, the Grecale EV has to be compromised because the platform was not designed as an electric vehicle. What will that compromise mean for performance? But in other respects this is more appealing to me than a Model Y.","March 22, 2022"
CTK,"I thought this was just the 500HP firebreather. That one seems redundant to me. The base mild hybrids seem a little weak... should have been PHEVs. The EV is interesting.

Doughynuts,"Of course the hope is that they continue to improve. But a poor track record is very difficult to overcome. Putting out a new shiny piece of turd only digs the hole deeper.EDIT: this is not to be misconstrued as a statement that its a turd. Like I said, I like it. Hopefully it turns out not to be a turd because more competition is always good for us enthusiasts.","March 22, 2022"

Supposedly better to own than an XK or F type, but not quite 981.I know someone who moved from a Cambiocorsa Coupe to the GT and his comments are ""the GT is daily-reliable, more comfortable but less special feeling.""

Wimbledon,"Given this model is on the same architecture as the Giulia/Stelvio, and shares (I believe) the same 4-cylinder engines as the Giulia/Stelvio, reliability should be similar to a Giulia/Stelvio.

The E-Pace is a size down. There's clearly going to be some overlap with the Stelvio Quadrifoglio but this well be an altogether more rounded package instead of going for outright sport.

Galrot,"That's not the Stelvio B-pillar panel though. Also the fitment looks pretty damn good for only they to have been grabbing something and the exact same piece of trim is used in all these late mules that have been photographed.

I also didn't say anything about the fit other than it was ""pretty darn good for only they to have been grabbing something"" either, but of course you don't really care about things such as facts regardless. Also I have no troubles admitting that I don't like most of Maseratis modern offerings. Very few appears to do which is of course their problem.All I'm saying is that the part looks cheap (admittedly my personal opinion) and that you will soon see that it is a production part. It's possible that the car will be absolute hit regardless. Or perhaps it will fail. I can't predict that.","January 16, 2022"

Wimbledon,"I like the Stelvio. And the Stelvio's interior is plenty nice enough for me and wouldn't stop me from owning one. That said, my understanding is that most reviews that compare the Stelvio to its rivals usually score the Stelvio's interior below the others.An example:Porsche Macan vs Alfa Romeo Stelvio: slingshot SUVs twin test reviewCAR magazine UK's Porsche Macan vs Alfa Romeo Stelvio twin-test review: which sporty SUV ticks all the boxes?www.carmagazine.co.uk""Climb inside the Alfa and first impressions are equally pleasing, though closer examination reveals some cheap detailing on the switchgear and gear selector. And it gets worse the lower you go. The bonnet release lever, for instance, appears to be made from one of those curling plastic fish you get in cheap Christmas crackers. Given how frequently you might be asked to lift the lid to show someone that ‘Ferrari-inspired’ V6, you’d think they’d make the lever from something more substantial.""The review concludes that the Alfa is more exciting than the Macan. I'll overlook some interior material choices in favor of a more exciting drive overall, so I'd take the Stelvio.","January 16, 2022"

The MC20 reviews have been excellent and it’s a car that has shown Maserati can fight with the big boys buts it a halo car. They know need to take that good press with that car and build on it and having average reviews will be the death of them with a car like this and this has to sell well for them. I so want them to succeed and make cars that turns the imagine around with Joe public as we need to start to see more bread and butter Maseratis on the road.

They will start every morning and won’t break down, they promise, with apparent sincerity. Yet with this renowned old Italian marque, experience has shown that reality proves less than the sum of these promises.I well remember a Maserati launch during which I heard a terrible thump, which was the driver’s-side window breaking loose and falling into the door bottom. Then it rained heavily.But since January 2021, when Maserati – along with the basket of goods that was Fiat Chrysler Automobiles – became part of the Stellantis Group, promises have to be kept. Or else the mega-group’s boss of bosses, Carlos Tavares, will ease out the recalcitrant division manager, in this case Davide Grasso, on the toe of his boot; believe me, failure is not an option.So, suddenly, in its 109th year, Alfieri Maserati’s firm, founded in Bologna but now headquartered down the road in Modena, has to make reliable cars as well as beautiful ones.The marque’s famed trident badge, devised by Alfieri’s younger brother Mario after seeing the fontana di Nettuno (Neptune’s fountain) in the centre of the family’s home town of Bologna, will now stand not only for style, charismatic engines and fantastic performance, but also dependability.What’s more, Maserati’s finances, so often convoluted and deeply unprofitable, are to be put on a sound footing. To that end, Maserati is following the market to deliver this, the Grecale, a smaller, family-sized and more affordable SUV, which follows in the footsteps of the Levante large SUV of a few years ago.Can it be true? The renowned Italian purveyor of sports cars and gran turismos producing a family SUV to do battle with countless bland Volkswagen ID.4s, Volvo XC40s, BMW X4s, Jaguar F-Paces, Audi Q4s and, of course, the Porsche Macan. Really?There are four versions, all arriving this year, starting with the £61,570 GT, which has a 296bhp/332lb ft 2.0-litre turbo engine with a belt-driven starter/generator mild hybrid system and an electric turbocharger to mitigate the lag before the turbo spins at its most efficient. It is capable of 149mph and 0-62mph in 5.6sec, with economy of 32.5mpg and CO2 emissions of 198g/km.The £67,180 Modena tested here has a bit more power at 325bhp, the same 332lb ft of torque and top speed, but will accelerate to 62mph in 5.3sec, while delivering 32mpg and 199g/km.The top model is the Trofeo, at the distinctly top price of £99,700. It has a 3.0-litre, twin-turbo V6 engine developing 523bhp/457lb ft. It’s capable of 177mph, with 0-62mph in 3.8sec, 16.2mpg and emitting 254g/km.A battery electric model called the Folgore (Italian for thunderbolt) will arrive later in the year.All models are four-wheel drive with a ZF eight-speed torque converter automatic gearbox. The top Trofeo has air springs, active dampers and an electronic limited-slip differential; the others have conventional steel springs, passive dampers and a mechanical limited-slip differential, which can all be upgraded to Trofeo spec. The upgrade to air suspension costs £1,400.The options list is quite a scary place, actually, with 21-inch wheels at £1,585, carbon-fibre twill trim at £2,030, a driver assistant pack of adaptive cruise, active lane management, blind-spot monitoring and LED matrix headlights at £2,535 and a Sonus Faber premium 21-speaker sound system at £2,200.That’s just for starters. The £67,180 Modena tested here ended up at £84,775 when all the extras were included. The Grecale is built at the Alfa Romeo factory in Cassino, Italy, alongside Alfa’s Stelvio SUV, with which it shares its platform (also used in the Alfa Giulia saloon and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV).Family SUVs such as the Grecale tend to have generic styling, because that’s what the market likes and no one dares to go against the grain. While the vibe is very much that of the Porsche Macan, the Grecale’s front is lifted by a large, toothy grille with a prominent trident badge. A trademark trio of vents in the wings pull the eye along the body curves and the pronounced haunches over the rear wheels look purposeful.The front seats are generous, with good lumbar support for your lower back, but quite pinchy side cushions that squash your kidneys after a long time at the wheel. Electronic seat adjustment allows a good driving position, but the seat feels too high and taller drivers might find themselves wishing its base were a couple of inches lower.The digital facia consists of two screens: the instrument binnacle, which is clear and concise, and a centre touchscreen, which is relatively simple to navigate, with the gear selection buttons underneath. Buttons operate electronic latches to open and shut the doors, which would have been a brave move in the old days of Maserati, and there’s the panoply of modern electronic connectiveness, including a WiFi hotspot, an Alexa virtual assistant and a telephone app that will continue to give you last-mile directions from the satnav after you’ve parked up.There’s also the traditional Maserati clock at the top centre of the dashboard, now in a switchable-face digital style; such a pity it looks and feels pretty cheap. On the other hand, the trim and fabric choices seem well matched, pleasant to touch and more luxurious than the upmarket herd.The rear seats are comfortable and plush, with just enough leg room for one 6ft adult sitting behind another. Head room is reasonably generous, too, and three adults fit in the back easily.The four-cylinder engine sounds flat and unresponsive initially. You need to boot the accelerator pedal, but then it spins up into the strong mid-range, with the electric turbo giving an alacrity to its responses. It sounds good at high revs, but the urge tails off rapidly and there’s not much point in searching for the red line.","May 28, 2023"
MarkMas,"The ZF eight-speed is a lovely gearbox, slurring changes when needed, kicking down fast when full power is required and responding quickly to the steering-wheel paddles. The Sport setting leaves it in a higher gear than you’d normally choose, but it’s ready for the call.Will you notice the extra 30bhp of the Modena version? Probably not, but most folk will take it because more is more and the higher power doesn’t punish you too much at the pumps.The Trofeo is the diva of the range –expensive, the V6 lovely to listen to, technically accomplished … and quite nice to hand back before you face the bills. And while it’s something of a dragster, when it comes to a corner, particularly a bumpy one, it reveals every single one of its extra 187kg over the weight of the Modena.Like all of these high-riding SUVs, the Grecale has to satisfy the need to ride gently while giving the impression of cornering like a sports car, and the result of this moderation is seldom completely satisfactory.With all-round independent suspension, Maserati has achieved a good compromise for the air-suspended cars, but a brilliant compromise for the standard steel suspension, which rides well, steers with precision and corners with lean but not sloppiness.The standard chassis feels well balanced and surprisingly comfortable compared with Porsche’s Macan. This new Maserati, entering one of the most heavily competitive classes of car, feels like one of those left-field choices that turns out to be a surprisingly sound one.You’ll have your own views on whether Maserati should be providing well-heeled families with SUVs such as this, but then you’d probably have to have the same opinion on Porsche and its equivalent as well.As it stands, the Grecale is good-looking, with a fine combination (for the class) of ride and handling, while the overall dynamics are impressive. But this is an expensive car – prohibitively so if you dig deep into the options list – and you can have a desirable Porsche Macan with a V6 engine for less whether you buy it outright or take a PCP finance deal.What’s more, as with any car, Maserati’s claims of great residual values (RV) are hot air until you sell your Grecale or realise the final value settlement after a three-year lease. It’s still a risk, but unlike in the past, the Grecale is slightly less of an affair of the heart and more one of the head.The factsBody style: Five-door family SUVOn sale: Summer 2023 (Folgore battery-electric version follows later this year)How much? range £61,570 to £99,700 (£67,180 as tested)How fast? 149mph, 0-62mph in 5.3secHow economical? 30.7mpg to 32.5mpg (WLTP combined), 28.5mpg on testEngine and gearbox: 1,995cc, four-cylinder turbo petrol with 48-volt mild hybrid system, eight-speed automatic gearbox, four-wheel drivepower/torque 325bhp @ 5,750rpm/332lb ft @ 2,000-5,000rpmCO2 emissions: 199-210g/km WLTPVED: £1,565 first year, £570 next five years, then £180Warranty: 3 years/unlimited mileageThe rivalsRange Rover Velar S P250from £53,735Appears much larger than the Grecale, although it’s actually only 4,797mm long.

edit,"I will not insist about the things thst are fantastic with this car l, as allready were spoken by others, but only on what could have been better from my perspective.For our country, it is more logic that refuelling to be on the right side of the car.The truck it is not enough with 535 liters. At least not for me.I have touch screens commands also on A6. When you are pushing a button, it vibrates like you are pushing a real button. This distractes you somehow, as you need to concentrate yourself. On the other hand, on the Grecale it is too sensitive. I really dont remember when I started my seat heating when driving..only felt the seat started to burn. Probabily the best solution is in between this 2 cars.The fan of the AC is a little bit noisy. Anyhow, the AC is colling the car 3 times better than in the A6.This car is not built to accomodate a child seat. You can accomodate but at the expense of destroying the leather on that area. This is what will happend with mine.The tow hitch is a complete joke. It is not electric deploiment, not even mechanic deployment. You have the hitch in your truck and you have to manually put it under the car. You have keys to remove the hitch, keys that you cand loose it, it seems difficult and dirty job.The insulation could have been better. I have insulated windows, but still it is a lot of noise inside the cabin.The fuel tank is tooo small. At least 2-3 gallons extra could give you more confort.Today we will have 120miles trip back home, all type of roads. Leets see what is to be added.","June 25, 2023"

The isofix you don't need it...for me is a disaster as shown in pictures above.For instance, some complain about the HUD. This feature is something I never use it. It was turned off by me since day one. Warren is complaining the back doors don't automatically unlock by itself until you are opening first the front doors. The same is here, but I don't care, I like to unlock the car from the key and then all doors are unlocked.For me keyless entry is an option I never wanted along with hud, but they are standard feature.The same object or person is completely different depends of the needs of person looking at.","June 30, 2023"

AusTrofeo,"Hey WarrenB, you’re right in saying that the air suspension doesn’t lower to the lowest setting everytime. There are a couple of nuances to this.1. You must drive over 40km/h for the car to automatically lower2. If for some reason you were in Sport/ Corsa and decide to return the dial to GT after you have parked. The car raises itself to the normal height.Why you can’t select Entry/ Park height on the display is beyond me as you can do it in the Levante.","July 2, 2023"

AusTrofeo,"Was informed by the sales person when taking delivery as I questioned why the vehicle was not in the entry/ exit height and how we can get it into that setting.There are some particular nuances which haven’t been fully articulated such as why Aero 2 is blocked out and why entry / exit can’t be manually selected when stationary, etc.From memory the previous vehicles I had with air suspension didn’t require the engine to be on to change ride heights (you could turn the engine off before it reached entry/ exit height and it would still continue to lower)","July 2, 2023"
WarrenB,"Not sure I would trust a sales person 😁. I tried it now and assuming you are at any height other than off-road, all you have to do is put the car in “D” and back into “P” and the car will lower so there isn’t a 40km/h limitation. I’ve found you can turn the car off, open the door and close it, and the car will lower but it doesn’t always do it. My BMW allowed you to set it in the infotainment and it had a button in the trunk/boot. It’s important to me as I have a family member in a wheel chair and it makes it easier for her to get in.aero 2 is blocked out by design. It only lowers to aero 2 when the car goes over 195km/h or when it remains between 180km/h and 195km/h for more than 15secs. I’ll never use it in the USA as that is jail speed. It’s detailed in the manual.","July 2, 2023"
edit,"Agree with Warren about the aero 2.What I see about my car is the parking mode for suspension is needing some long time to reach the lowest level.But yes, if you put the gearbox in parking, engine still on, the car lowers.If you open the door, engine on, the car stops lowering..it pops you a message in the dash (also this scenario is mentioned in the book).But if you stop the engine fast after parking, you will not benefit from this option as you are stepping out and the car still lowers itself.I really dont know if always parking mode works, but I'm 100% sure once happens to put the car in Aero 1 (I'm always driving this way), saw the indicator in the dash saying the car is doing this and after few minutes the car shows the suspension is in the normal height mode.LATER EDIT.Guys, what tires pressure do you have?I got 2.4-2.5.","July 3, 2023"

edit,"I didn't find the discution about this thing on the forum, but it seems my car does the same regarding parking height of the air suspension.I was moving the car one meter backwards yesterday and the suspension never goes back to automatic parking position, even if is set to do so and it was so before that 1 meter moving.Also, once, my wife locked the car with the trunk locking button after she took something from there, even if we needing to take someting from inside the car. So I unloked the car from the key fob to take the item from the inside of the car.The air suspension lifted the car (i dont think it was normal) as I didn't start the engine and never get back to parking position after locking.Then, many times when driving, even If I'm putting the car manually in the aero 1, happens to reverse by itself to normal position.This means nothing to me, even if mentioned, but some people coud find this very annoying.Let's say after 1000km I'm staying as bad things about Grecale not with this software unfinished business (as long they are not transfor themselves in to malfunctions that are asking for repaires) but with things that are related with the core construction of the car mentioned before:Suspension knocking hard on bumpy roads and engine noise, not isofix friendly, joking tow hook and too seensitive touch screens as you can start or stop by mistake any type of command on the touch screen.The first 2 from the total of 5 are upseting me the most","July 15, 2023"

EDZ,"So I found out yesterday this is more by design than a flaw and a good job it did stop, For Safety issues.I parked the car next to a very high curb/footpath/sidewalk it stopped lowering the suspension when I opened the door and a very good job it did.The door only just cleared the curb by less than 1mm had the suspension continued to lower the door would had been seriously damaged, due to the height of the curb had the car continuing to lower, it would had hit and lifted the door on the curb, so be grateful we have this safety feature, "" It's not a fault"".","July 16, 2023"
edit,Totally agree.This is the way should be.@EDZit didn't happend to your car to 'forget' to lower to parkins position?,"July 15, 2023"
WarrenB,"Just to clarify the functionality and I’ve tested this extensively, it does indeed stop lowering when you open the door but it continues lowering when the door is closed. I’ve found the only time it doesn’t lower is if you open the door before you put the car into park or before you turn the car off, as well as if the car isn’t parked on a level surface. Did it not continue lowering for you?","July 15, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi edit,Thankfully it did stop lowering but there was a momentary split second of panic as I opened the door quicker than normal after switching off to see how close I was with the bottom of the door on the curb/footpath.","July 15, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi WarrenBYes when I closed the door it continued to lower after a few seconds, when I came back had to be careful getting back in as car door was lower by a few millimetres than the height of the curb.","July 15, 2023"
WarrenB,Either the car doesn’t function the way it’s intended to do or the manual is incorrect but the manual says the engine must be running for it to lower which isn’t true.They should have put a button in the trunk/boot to lower or raise the car like other manufacturers. The huge benefit of this is loading packages into the back or wheelchair access.,"July 15, 2023"
EDZ,"I did't actually physically see the car continue to lower after closing the door but obviously it did lower, as when I returned the door did not clear the higher part of the stepped curb, I suppose seeing how close the door was to the curb on arrival the car it's self could had settled a mill or two. I personally have not checked the actual functionality in depth or as much as yourself, it just seems to work accordingly for me and I have no issues with it's functionality.","July 15, 2023"
John,"Glad that’s yet another so called issue debunked that I’ve read about, 😊 and rightly so how it should work.","July 15, 2023"
WarrenB,My car doesn’t work as intended so it’s not debunked or a “so called“ issue for me. My car just doesn’t lower at times when it should. I’ve had 2 loaners to compare to so I have a very good idea what is normal and what isn’t.,"July 16, 2023"

Seeing some of the comments here about new cars already having to go back for updates does give a bit of concern.However, I visited the dealer yesterday and their first 2 Grecale’s have now arrived in last few days - no Trofeo’s though.

Nearly six months later I'm told having trouble with paint finishso I personally take status codes with a pinch of salt. Sorry I don't wish to be a party pooper but I have as Iv'e said before had every excuse in the book why it has not yet arrived. All Iv'e ever wanted is honesty from the manufacturer, even the dealers are getting frustrated, they are obviously taking the flake by just passing on what they have been told.","December 24, 2022"
UKTrofeo,Well I’m trying to be optimistic. The dealer has had a number of GTs and Modenas delivered so are aware of the broad way that the production codes have progressed for cars that they have had delivered recently. If your car has reached production code 50f a while ago then certainly I would be less confident. Mine was on code 20 for months. I’m guessing that right hand drive Trofeos have been a bit of an issue for Maserati hence the delays. However a paint finish issue would affect Modenas and GTs as well. Mine is a different colour to yours. We will see if there are further delays pretty soon!!!,"December 24, 2022"
EDZ,"Unfortunately my optimism has been knocked several times, but I still smile and hold on to some hope that it will turn up soon. The Trefeo Primaserie is a specialist four coat colour finish under the fluorecie program (according to the price list I have a 15k extra) and not done on normal production line run as other colours listed. The car is pulled from line and painted else where apparently, so does not follow the same line production run schedule as all other cars, hence what I was told last update. As you say will be interesting to see what they say in the new year, my dealer is far more optimistic for the Q1 delivery but will no longer say he is confident. 🤣 All the best, and have a great Christmas.","December 24, 2022"

elchiki,"EDZ said:Welcome to the forum edit.It's been virtually impossible to get discounts on any new cars for the last couple of years, due to supply and demand. Manufactures have been struggling to get parts linked with the semiconductor shortages and just can not produce the amount of cars required for the market. Add to this that the Grecale is a brand new model and orders are buoyant, they have no need to discount, plenty of customers in the queue. You may be lucky and get something thrown in but don't hold your breathI'm sure as the parts shortage and semi conductor issues slowly subside, linked with the current bad global economy figures, the rise in cost of living and energy costs, demand will ease and maybe a little discount will return, but not for a while yet.

vicster,Just got my Grecale Modena Primaserie on Feb 14 and received about 5% discount at my Canadian dealership with lots of extras.,"February 18, 2023"
EDZ,Welcome to the forum and congrats in getting your car.Always good and nice to see a few pics of the car when you get the opportunity to post.Enjot your new ride.,"February 19, 2023"
edit,I'm planning to pay the down payment next week also for a Modena.Did you got it from stock or it was your configuration?I'm curious about the waiting time,"February 19, 2023"
vicster,"I had it configured back in April last year. Delivery was supposed to be in October but I'm guessing they were still passing inspection to be approved for the road.My dealer had a few cancellations so buying from stock was possible. In fact, I ordered a white one and they were able to swap it for a black one configured the exact same way ✌","February 19, 2023"
edit,"Just payed today the deposit for a Grecale Modena nicely configured.The dealer said the estimated delivery time is 3 to 4 monthsbtw, in the contract I have a paragraph that is mentioning the price will be retroactive increased if the production cost will increase until my car will be delivered.Did you have something like this when ordering yours?","February 22, 2023"
Tony Mac,"Good choice editEarly January, when we started considering ordering a Grecale, the Dealer said it would be a 4 month wait and that they were expecting a Price rise in March. So taking delivery in April / May would be at the increased price.The Dealer had a Launch Event with New Stock Grecale's in the showroom - we bought a Modena and picked it up the following week","February 22, 2023"
EDZ,"Congrats on placing your order edit,hope your wait is not to long.Most manufacturers have that type of paragraph in the sales contract, actual price you pay as that quoted when your car actually goes into build. Dealers normally ask at that stage to increase your deposit to a full none refundable 10% of total cost of car, no increases normally after that point even if it takes a couple of more months to eventually arrive at dealers.","February 22, 2023"

Tony Mac,Shocking EDZ - I couldn’t have waited this long 😞,"February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi TonyTo be honest if I had been told I would be waiting over a year for the car when ordering it, I may have looked else where then. The trouble is that Maserati have been playing me along, each time a delivery date arrives it's not met and I'm given another delivery date which is normally only a few weeks later, so I hold fire as most new cars at present are taking around six months. If we all had crystal balls I'm sure we would all do things differently, but life at present is so unpredictable. Do hope your car is going well and you are still enjoying it.All the best.","February 23, 2023"
Tony Mac,"You are stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I’m sure it will be truly worth the stress and frustration of waiting.In December 2022 we were considering a Mecan / Cayenne and the build wait was 12+ months.Still enjoying our Modena, only done 350 miles - no issues to report🤞","February 23, 2023"
EDZ,"edit said:@EDZI was thinking this morning regarding your situation.Maybe Maserati delivered the car actually and maybe your car has technical problems and in fact is in the dealer warehouse trying to fix it.If your car was at Maserati factory with some issues, it is impossible to not have the technical knowledge or resources to fix it. They are delivering cars on daily basis to all the corners of the world. So, what are the reason to not replace quarter of your car, if needed and to deliver the car, if the car is still at the factory?If your car is at the dealer and the dealer is lying to you, the repairs are more difficult via air at the dealer and always the dealer needing to have maserati mails and sugestions.If I was you, I will visit the dealer without telling him upfront and tell that you want to search the car in the back warehouse/garage to be sure that they are playing wright with you as the trust regarding them is lost. They have to demonstrate you this is the reality and they don't have the car in pieces somewhere. do not leave until you inspect the dealer and do not give them time to hide the car.My dealer told me they will deliver my Modena in 3-4 months calculating from the downpayment.Click to expand...Thank you for your thoughts and suggestion edit.I have already visited the dealers on a few occasions and the car is definitely not there. My dealers are part of a very large group and also very large in the USA and are the largest Maserati dealers in the UK with branches all over the country.Late yesterday I actually email Maserati direct in Italy to get honest clarification of what is actually going on with my car as my dealer is at a loss also. Iv'e had an acknowledgement receipt of same and will have to await what they finally reply, but will contact again early next week if not received.","February 24, 2023"

EDZ,"TF007 said:Hello@EDZthis is simply shocking and unacceptable.We are talking about a car that has a worldwide delivery time of about 3 to maximal 4 months. At all dealers, moreover, the car is in stock. Here something runs completely wrong. Even if it should be because of your equipment variant, they must be able to name that and offer options. By the way, the current Macan GTS has a delivery time of 3 months again and in general, delivery times have dropped at all manufacturers.If they can't provide a very clear and logical explanation (which they haven't been able to do so far), then I would withdraw from the contract. Isn't there a right of rescission in the UK?As great as the Grecale is...I hope you find a good solution for you!Anyway, very sorry to hear all this.Click to expand...Thanks for your input TF007, appreciated.We do have the right of rescission in the UK.

This is as he said, something that they have never seen or heard of before and he is very interested in knowing the outcome.

EDZ,"1stMaserati said:That is really heartbreaking to read@EDZ. Just as Maserati is getting great press and Stelantis looks like really re-polishing the brand (look at the Granturismo) and trying to push itself into the space where others have been so successful (i.e. Porsche and the Macan), it is simply mind boggling that situations like this (no one can track your primaserie order?????) can happen.If the entire customer experience sucks, then the brand suffers.Pure speculation, but maybe things with the UK dealer and Maserati Italy are not as good as they appear and that is the root cause? So there is a problem that you are not seeing or privy to. What is weird is that you had several promises of delivery with a date. Either this was the dealer plucking it out of thin air to placate you or how else can that be explained. Can you “demand“ a VIN number and ask if the car has even been built?Hope this resolves itself soon!Click to expand...Thanks 1stMaseratiI totally agree with your first two paragraphs and would like to think Stelantis would not be impressed with what is happening in this situation one little bit.Iv'e been down so many avenues now and just continually hitting a brick wall each and every time.

1stMaserati,Great news@EDZ!!!!!As an aside… What does this all mean for us on the road in a Grecale? Is there a recall wave coming for all of us with software updates? Funnily I was the the dealer today (less than 3 km from home and next to the petrol station I normally use) as I knew the new Granturismo arrived. They did not mention any software recall for delivered cars.As for the Granturismo… easy on the eyes is all I can say!,"March 17, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi 1stMaseratiDuring my conversations things I was sort of told were tongue-in-cheek and still a little cloak and dagger as to real reasons, so obviously some can be taken with a pinch of salt. But I was lead to believe that most software updates can be done over the air, that is cars that are on the road, but new cars are not fully livened up until they arrive at the dealers and sold, so require manual update. Basically they told me as little as possible but keep me happy.Cars are now being released and in fact some are now arriving at dealers.

Paoloalfieri,14 days old grecale Gt.Even if hud is in on position display dont work.,"April 14, 2023"
MaseratiCares,"RichG75 said:I bought my Grecale GT on June 10th. By June 17th the car was towed into the dealership due to a dead battery that would not jump start. The dealership had the vehicle for 4 days, installed software updates and recharged the battery. The dealer declared the vehicle good to go and I picked the car up the following Wednesday June 21st. Unfortunately, 2 days later the car was dead again and towed back into the dealership where they are currently working on it. Currently the car has 365 miles on it and has spent more time in the shop than in my driveway. To say I'm disappointment is an understatement. I have already contacted a Lemon Law Attorney and I'm waiting to get the car back....so that I can break down a 3rd time and we can get the ball rolling with a Lemon Law claim. Totally unfortunate for an $80k vehicle. Maserati North America needs to offer buy backs for the affected cars and continue their R&D before making the cars available for sale to the public. Also, I read that Maserati is banking on the the success of Grecale as they need a volume seller to pump up their bottom line. This vehicle in its current state is not going to help with Maserati's future success.Click to expand...Hi RichG75,We understand how frustrating this must be for you.

I'm hoping it is just a software glitch and will be fixed soon.Outside of this, the car is great and seems even more responsive in GT mode than my macan turbo I traded in.

WarrenB,Do you agree with this review?Grecale ReviewThis is the first review that has called out the linear braking of the car. My wife keeps on having a go at me because I’m giving her whiplash so I know have proof it’s not me.I also find the accelerator to be very much the same. At times it’s fine but at times I touch the accelerator and nothing happens and I give a bit more gas and nothing and a bit more where I’m probably around a third down and then the car takes off like a floored it. What’s strange is that it doesn’t always happen. Has anyone else experienced this?,"July 2, 2023"
Tony Mac,"Very interesting review that pretty much sums up my thoughts on the Grecale.I’m happy to pay a slight price premium for the Grecale because, in my opinion, it’s much better looking than the Porsche Mecan. Plus everyone stops to look at it and I haven’t seen another one on the roads.@WarrenB- agree on the Brakes - at low speed - very little ‘feel’ plus noisy and grabby.","July 2, 2023"
WarrenB,"Couldn’t agree more. Whenever I valet it, they always park it outside the entrance to the restaurant and put the Macans in the parking garage. They just need to solve the irritating issues all caused by software so they are fixable.Do you find the accelerator can also be a bit like the brakes at slow speeds or when pulling off? Almost like an on off switch. you gently touch it and It sometimes does nothing so you push a bit more and nothing, so a bit more and it then takes off like I floored it. It’s Inconsistent.","July 2, 2023"

The dealer kept the car until June 21, 2023, and then declared the car ""Good to go."" According to the dealer the vehicle had multiple software upgrades that were needed one of which was designed to help with battery issues. I picked the car up on June 21, 2023, and by June 23, 2023, the vehicle was towed back to the dealership for the same issue. Dead battery! The vehicle had 360 miles on it when towed in. The car is still at the dealership today. The dealership did a deep cycle charge on the battery with no luck and then they were instructed by Maserati Engineering to install a higher output battery. Currently they are holding the vehicle for a few days to see if the vehicle losses power. In addition to this I have had all of the other issues that other Grecale owners are reporting, doors hard to get into, key not detected while driving down the road, and the other one is the auto stop/start is sometimes on with out me pushing the button and sometimes it isn't.

I’ve been in a Mercedes and BMW over the past 6 years and they both just worked out the dealer door. I don’t really expect to be dealing with this when paying this kind of money for a 4 cylinder car and a premium over comparable competitive brands . I have a Modena Limited Edition fully loaded with everything except for the roof racks. Is anyone else having these issues or what other issues are you finding?1. Wireless charger doesn’t work. Maserati are updating a part in it and the dealer is waiting for the part from Italy.2. Every now and then, the sound system will start playing out of one speaker on the driver side door. It seems the only way to fix it is to stop the car, turn off and open the door.3. The key system including keyless entry is just hopeless. Keyless entry works when it wants to. Pushing the key button to lock the car doesn’t always work and at other times it locks but doesn’t beep. Exiting the car and walking around it in the garage to get inside sometimes results in 5 to 6 beeps. I never really know if the car is locked or not. To make it worse, rather than having a smaller speaker to provide an audible tone, it screams at you through the main horn/hooter so the key issues and all the honking is beginning to irritate my neighbors.4. The trunk/boot kick sensor beeps but never opens it.5. A speaker in the passenger door has a bad vibration even with normal base set.6. An issue that has been happening which my dealer mentioned to me that I haven’t encountered is the battery is going flat In some cars. Supposedly the car has been recognizing people’s keys in their homes and turning the car systems on which has been draining the battery.I worked with a few dealers on the east coast before buying and I could never figure out why none of them knew much about the car and I was teaching them as I had watched all the YouTube videos. It turns out Maserati will not give the dealers cars for their sales team to drive to get to know the car and help test it for them. I’m betting we as early adopters are beta testing the car for them and if that is the case, we should be paid for doing itThere are a lot of extremely positive reviews on YouTube so far but all by people who are doing quick test drives. I think I’m going to do one on my experiences to date to help people make an informed decision and make them understand what they are buying in to.

I have a Modena Limited Edition fully loaded with everything except for the roof racks. Is anyone else having these issues or what other issues are you finding?1. Wireless charger doesn’t work. Maserati are updating a part in it and the dealer is waiting for the part from Italy.2. Every now and then, the sound system will start playing out of one speaker on the driver side door. It seems the only way to fix it is to stop the car, turn off and open the door.3. The key system including keyless entry is just hopeless. Keyless entry works when it wants to. Pushing the key button to lock the car doesn’t always work and at other times it locks but doesn’t beep. Exiting the car and walking around it in the garage to get inside sometimes results in 5 to 6 beeps. I never really know if the car is locked or not. To make it worse, rather than having a smaller speaker to provide an audible tone, it screams at you through the main horn/hooter so the key issues and all the honking is beginning to irritate my neighbors.4. The trunk/boot kick sensor beeps but never opens it.5. A speaker in the passenger door has a bad vibration even with normal base set.6. An issue that has been happening which my dealer mentioned to me that I haven’t encountered is the battery is going flat In some cars. Supposedly the car has been recognizing people’s keys in their homes and turning the car systems on which has been draining the battery.I worked with a few dealers on the east coast before buying and I could never figure out why none of them knew much about the car and I was teaching them as I had watched all the YouTube videos. It turns out Maserati will not give the dealers cars for their sales team to drive to get to know the car and help test it for them. I’m betting we as early adopters are beta testing the car for them and if that is the case, we should be paid for doing itThere are a lot of extremely positive reviews on YouTube so far but all by people who are doing quick test drives. I think I’m going to do one on my experiences to date to help people make an informed decision and make them understand what they are buying in to. A potentially great car that is very new and still has a lot of issues that need to be resolved.What are your experiences so far?Click to expand...The charger in ours has never worked but most disappointing is the car has been in the Maserati shop more than on the road or our garage! Just drains the battery DEAD.","April 29, 2023"

Samer B.,I’m having issues with the key/entry system as it works sporadically. The alarm keeps going off with and message stating the key fob is not in the car.

My car has been in the service center for 55 days of the 76 days I’ve owned it because of the keyless entry system nonconformities.

I've had the car less than one week. I purchased this Grecale out of state because the local dealership closed down. Here are the issues I'm having.1). Less than 12 hours after arriving home and vehicle in the garage the battery was completely dead. Had to have 24/7 roadside assistance come jump the car and even then it took several minutes to charge it enough to start the vehicle.2). HUD no longer displaying at all. All settings in both the controls on the steering wheel and center console show HUD is on.3). Horn honks when locking the car even though that setting is disabled in the settings.Wife very much likes the car but for this kind of money these issues should not be happening. Dealership has confirmed all software updates have been applied. Again, we have had this car for 4 days now.

italia,"@edit. Thanks for your reply. I'm quite a bit older than you, and have driven more miles and (probably) owned more motorcycles and cars than you. But this is not a pissing match right.?That said, in recent years, the number of drains on a battery when the car is not in use is not comparable to most cars older than 5-6 years. A 2017 BMW may not be comparable in parasitic drain to some newer cars. Anyway, believe what you want, but parasitic drain is a thing. Some vehicles have very little parasitic drain - others have considerable drain. Good luck with your experiences and assumptions.","June 21, 2023"

If you go to GT or Confort, the S bulb dissapears.Of course, you can press the S button for suspension also in GT and Confort.The fact that for Trofeo there is S and also H bulb, it is becoming confusing for all Grecale range.I did not understand if for Trofeo there is S, H bulb and no bulb also.","June 24, 2023"
GrecaleQVTrofeo,"I do not know the MODENA , but I think this model has no CORSA mode. That’s probably the reason why only the TROFEO has three suspension settings.

The S suspension is absolutely sufficient even for faster driving.The TROFEO is the best car I have ever driven.","June 24, 2023"

Shouliop1,"I've come across numerous threads highlighting issues. However, I'm uncertain if these accounts accurately reflect the experiences of all owners or if they represent a minority who encountered unfortunate circumstances with their models. What are your thoughts? If given the chance to reconsider, would you still choose to purchase the Grecale?My primary concerns revolve around reliability problems and potential depreciation, particularly in comparison to other Maserati models. I'm open to tolerating minor software-related inconveniences.","June 12, 2023"
Shouliop1,"Considering that most problems appear to originate from the USA and being in Canada places me in close proximity to it, that could be a tad worrisome.

WarrenB,"You can laugh at us EDZ but forums are one way of influencing change. My dealer is as fed up with the issues in the Grecale as us users are as they are having to deal with all of it where they have no control or ability to fix them. They have a long list of Ferraris needing to be serviced and the Grecale’s are using up all the space. My wheels are not going around as my car is back in the service center again for issues that just work in Toyota’s or Hondas which is just unacceptable from a luxury brand. So I will continue to bang the drum!!!EDZ said:Welcome to the forum.Unfortunately a forum attracts those with issues or problems as they search the internet when they arise. Some want to air their anger and attack the manufacturer etc. You also get the die hard that continue to bang their drum over and over again on every post and seem to have every issue possible, sometimes makes me wonder if their wheels even go round 😂 There are members that have had no issues what so ever and some that have had minor issues that you get with all manufacturers now days, sorted with software update. Don’t know why but it seems most issues are coming from USA.I have had my Trefeo for nearly two months and have had no issues whatsoever, I’m delighted with my purchase and have no regrets at all, fantastic car all round.Stand by for the die hard drum players I’m sure they will be on your post very soon.Good luck which ever way you go with purchase.Click to expand...","June 3, 2023"
WarrenB,"Agreed but not ideal especially in US cities like Atlanta that are noisy where you can’t hear the click. The mirror fold is a sign but an issue if they are already folded. My issue is that I can’t even get to the petrol tank to open it without the car locking itself let alone getting to the pump. 9/10 times I can’t open the boot/trunk as the kick sensor beeps 2 twice and does nothing and the button doesn’t work as the car isn’t seeing the key when standing there. The front doors sometimes just won’t open too and you have to use the physical key buttons.What issues did you have? What did they do to fix it?Tony Mac said:I get that having the horn beep when locking the car is infuriating - it doesn’t happen on the UK Grecale’sBut this behaviour can be turned off?I also understand that turning the beeping off also stops the beep when locking the car, which isn’t ideal behaviour. But if that’s the way it works - it’s not a Toyota / Honda - that’s the way it works.When locking the car the Mirrors fold in + you can hear the click, making it quite clear the car is locked?The keyless entry on my Grecale was also a pain-in-the-backside - randomly working / failing.

EDZ,"Umze said:I got a Modena some weeks ago. Fantastic car. I will come back to this.. No software issues really You need to tinker with options to your liking though, invest some free time t do it. I wished Android Auto reflected on the front HUD or Headsup but the main screen is big and ok. Wireless android or carplay works very nice. 2 phones could be connected at the same time. Cooling and AC works perfect, my preference is gentle fan. Cooling seasts work perfect in fact your butt could be cooled way more than intended and you are forced to turn off , which is a good thing in hot summer days. I have laminated glass (very recommended) silent driving. When pedalled only engine noise which is desired anyway. 840 Watt Premium sound system is very adequate, best I have had actually but I would go for 1200+watt High Premium as it has even a better bass system independently configurable. I don't have driving assistance packages advance matrix headlights, don't miss that feature!!!! You may find many comments in this forum thereabout. Air suspension is a must have!! First you can lower or alter height on demand, you have offroad driving mode, you may select the car to drop at the lowest at exit and enter at this s setting(I don't use it but anyway it is there), if you speed, car goes into Aero 2 mode after certain km/mile which is quite low and assists top speed, air suspension handles bumps better than GT standard passive shocks, even better than active shocks standard in Modena. By the way don't just go to GT. Modena has so many features by default and a more powerful car. Limited Mechanical Slip Differential is standard on Modena not on GT. Modena has a wider back, 295 back tyres, car shape closer to Trofeo. I speeded a couple of times and BMW new 5 series which are fast cars couldn't catch me, almost instantly got over 200Km. And this is not Trofeo. Heads up is nice but I think navigation on headsup is distracting. You have to turn the car off to get rid of it once you started. I only use Android Auto. Get Full Chevron leather package, it is worth. Carbon fiber copper yearn front console looks weird, seen in another Modena. Carbon fiber or piano black front console is nice enough IMO. General quality is posh and very nice, maybe some bright plastic buttons here and there. Car is spacey front and back. Adequate boot. Surround camera is practical but camera resolution is awful compared to other things and the infotainment system in the car. How the hell they chose it I have no idea. Ok.. drive-wise, really nice, sport mode makes the car alive, and very firm on the road but you can choose softer suspension even in sport mode. car inside lights become red in sport, nice..GT is the daily ride. very nice handling and taking the turns in general. Brakes could have been better, larger but it is ok as long as you don't race. This vehicle has a special stability module like many Porsches. Ohhh, dont get 20 inch wheels, please. 21 inches Crio or Pegasus wheels fit perfect to this car. They dont look big and reduces comfort IMO with air suspension. I have 21 inch Crio. One last thing, I couldn't have some options with my car due to practical reasons. If had the finances, go for all the major options, especially driving assistance packages and High Premium sound system, and all comfort options and go for Modena at the very least. I had to pay over €250k for my Modena due to exorbitant taxes otherwise I would have gone for a Trofeo for sure and save some money for MC20 in EU or USA or similarHope to have contributed your decision.

Possibly a software glitch? I understand we are driving a first Gen car in the Grecale but these hitches should be run of the mill testing and fixing before mass production.

Considering the Grecale only started being delivered in small quantities late July 2022 to a limited number of countries, the US only since January this year and some countries are only just receiving their first cars, I would say at a guess that maybe they will allow all countries to start getting deliveries for a few months first, which will be towards the very end of this year anyway.","May 21, 2023"

Examples are zoomable and side view surround view cameras where the image brightness, contrast etc can be set. Self parking and self reverse out of parking which we don’t have. Just 2 examples. The reason we are experiencing these issues is it’s Maserati’s first entry into the world of tech at the level of their competitors and I just don’t think they tested enough before releasing the car. I’m guessing they needed another 6 months to a year of testing but were forced to release it with the new Cayenne coming and the updates the the Mercedes GLC.","May 7, 2023"

TF007,"That's an interesting question. I have only driven just under 2000 kilometers, but I can already see a pattern. On short distances, the consumption is rather high: about 11-12 L. On longer distances with highway and country road, the consumption is with moderate driving at 8.9-9.5 liters. I think it could still go down to 8 liters, driven mostly on the highway. However, with very sporty driving, the fuel tank will be empty very quickly.Conclusion: the Grecale is not really economical, but if you are not always racing, expect consumption for longer distances of around 9 liters. For short trips, you have to accept a consumption well beyond 10/11 liters.","November 28, 2022"
1stMaserati,"Completely agree with@TF007. This is also based on driving less than 2.000 km so far. The one benefit: the Grecale does not need 98, but only 95. I asked the dealer twice and he said 95 is all it needs.","December 2, 2022"
TF007,"Yes 95 is enough, however, the manual says: ""For vehicle top performance, use unleaded gasoline with no less than 98 minimum octane rating.""So I decided to go with that. Maybe marginal difference, but why would they recommend it?","December 4, 2022"

Not saying Waze is 100% accurate, but there is a difference. On the Grecale 126 on the speedometer is 119 or 120 km/h. In the Macan 126 is 122/123. (I always use ACC as speeding is super expensive in Switzerland so alway go 5% faster).Click to expand...Apparently, and funny enough, Waze was one of the apps mentioned by my dealer that interferes with the software/charging. Hopefully Maserati will get it sorted soon.","December 2, 2022"

TF007,"Hi@Umzethe main difference is that level 2 has an active driving assistant. This means that the vehicle steers autonomously. Works very well, especially on the highway. The intersection collision assistant is also included as well as the traffic sign recognition.If you drive a lot on the highway, I would recommend this feature. If not, it is not absolutely necessary, because it does not work so well in towns and cities.","April 6, 2023"
Umze,"Hi TF007. Thanks for your message and comment. I rather wonder level 1 rather than level 2 which is significantly more expensive. In fact, due to scarce supply, I had to choose an already on the way Modena trim without a Driver pack Level 1 (or 2) over GTs with it. I am wondering if I am missing too much.In this regard, how is the level 1 autonomous adaptive cruise control in the city traffic especially along with blind spot etc. systems? How is also adaptive headlights, which is also included in level 1 ? As per your comment, Active steering on level 2 sounds truly another level to be used on the more free ways though never have used a similar assistance before.","April 9, 2023"

Umze,"Hi. Haven't received my Modena yet but as far as I know there are six suspension height settings. Aero2 is the lowest one at highway speed you should be able to select it manually from the touch screen(when driving) as well . I am not perfectly sure maybe the car is lowering itself after a certainspeed.ThisAero2 should be the parking setting at the same time. I digress from your question but this was one of the major reasons that I selected air suspension to be able to lower the car at high speed, which has many obvious benefits.","March 25, 2023"

edit,"My dealer told me the Aero 2 is the same with parking position. Could be wrong and in this way to be 6 positions as the parking to be even a lower position than Aero 2.But also I have the feeling 6 positions in range of a total of 65mm are too much, as it will e virtually no difference between 2 neighbour settings.EDZ, do you have the same info saying the Aero 2 is not manually accesible and it is only availble at car choice over 180kmh?","March 25, 2023"

Razbeo,Dealer has told me my Modena is expected around October 12th.,"August 21, 2022"
EDZ,"Congrats, possibly getting our cars around the same time, my dealer is waiting for the factory to reopen to get more of an update.","August 22, 2022"
Razbeo,"I did not know the factory was not open. I was at my dealer a week and a half ago picking up a new Alfa Romeo. At that time dealer told me my car was on the assembly line being built, and gave me a very general estimate of delivery time. Then Saturday the dealer contacted me, and said they had a further update and gave me the October 12th date. I had not contacted them as I did not expect any change in the status so soon.","August 22, 2022"
EDZ,"My dealer contacted me start of August to tell me mine was also in production and not to expect to much more info for a few weeks as they were now closed for their annual holiday until late August. But also said as soon as they return he will keep me informed as to its progress, although apparently progress can be slow sometimes and periods where not much happens, but expected around October delivery.","August 22, 2022"
EDZ,"TF007 said:I'm new here on the forum and I'm also one of the lucky buyers of the Maserati Grecale.I chose the Modena, in Grigio Lava with Ghiaccio interior color. 21"" rims are also included (yellow calipers) as well as all the other extras.Before I drove exclusively Mercedes, last the GLC. Actually I was planning to order the newest model. However, I was no longer satisfied with the build quality (a lot of plastic) and the rather marginal design update. It also suddenly felt boring to me.Then the Grecale came along. After the test drive I was completely excited. Finally, real emotions about a car again. No boring colors, a nice sound, a best in class sound system, the wonderful seats and then of course, that elegant and special design, inside and outiside. With the latest infotainment system, it was clear to me to say goodbye to Mercedes and enter the world of Maserati.I ordered mine on July, 26 and the expected delivery date is October, 9. (that's quick...!)Click to expand...Welcome to the forum. Nice choice.👍I think those of us that were lucky to get orders in early will start to see them in October and it looks like you may be one of the first 😉Like yourself I was impressed with the Grecale and ordered, well put a holding deposit down first even before the UK launch back at the beginning of April as there was only 10 Trofeo Primaseries coming to the UK. Don't forget to keep us all updated on delivery and obviously a few pic's on collection.","September 9, 2022"
TF007,Thanks for the warm welcome@EDZ! The Trofeo is also no bad choiceSure I will post the latest updates right here. Looking forward to any kind of news.,"September 9, 2022"
TF007,"Any updates from your side yet?I haven't heard anything from my dealer yet and looking at the car brokers in Europe, no one has a Mondena model yet (Only GT/Trofeo).","October 3, 2022"
EDZ,"Hi yaThe last update I had a week or so back was a slight delay in production/delivery. Quoted build completion is now end of October and I should now have my car start of November instead of later this month as originally quoted. There are still no models as of yet in the UK and it appears now the start of November is the due date. I believe it's only the GT and Trefeo Primasirie models arriving as there is no Modena Primaserie coming to UK, that is reserved I believe for the USA market which probably explains your Europe search findings.","October 3, 2022"
TF007,Thanks@EDZI see. I also think that there is a delay. There is still a request pending with my dealer.But I also expect November at the moment. I will keep you posted.,"October 3, 2022"
EDZ,"Thanks,will also keep you posted.","October 3, 2022"
TF007,"If all goes as planned, I'll be picking up my new Grecale next Friday! I'm really looking forward to it and I'm excited. Will then post pictures and my first impression here ...","October 16, 2022"
EDZ,Great news TF007. Do hope all goes to plan for you and looks like you will be one of the first. I'm awaiting feed back from my dealer with regards to mine. look forward to pictures and your first comments. Good luck.,"October 17, 2022"
Modenacanada,Great news. I assume you are in Europe? Any updates for buyers in north America?,"October 21, 2022"
EDZ,Welcome to the forum.I'm from Europe (UK) but have no information on North America. There are a few on the forum with orders and hopefully someone will have a little more news for you. Have you a car on order ?,"October 22, 2022"
Modenacanada,Yes. I ordered a blu intenso Modena launch package. I was told end of October but now that seems very unlikely.,"October 24, 2022"
EDZ,"Nice colour.As I posted above, think everyone with orders is in the same boat. Maserati seem to be a little behind, as unfortunately most manufacturers at present due to the on going semi conductor and parts supply issues. On placing my order back in April it was later confirmed mid to late October delivery but is now looking more like late November, even though I was told my car went into build in August. A friend of mine has a new Macan on order which completed build early September but has been sitting in the dealers compound ever since awaiting for missing parts to be fitted.","October 25, 2022"
Modenacanada,The wait is very tough. It seems that realistically we will be getting our cars in dec or January.,"October 27, 2022"
EDZ,"I'm ok with the wait my last 3 cars have taken between 12 and 18 months to arrive. What I find tough is when you are given a delivery date and it doesn't happen and a few more months are added on when you get very close to the original date given, a little more regular information on progress along the way would be good. Just to be kept in the loop on progress as they say rather than us having to keep contacting the dealer asking and waiting for a response whilst they find out, that's the frustrating tough point to me.","October 28, 2022"
EDZ,🌸🤣😂🤣🌸I'm sure someone will buy it............ $$$$$$$$$$$$$,"October 26, 2022"
EDZ,"Glad you got to see and feel in the real, looks far better in person than pictures. Did you get to hear the amazing stereo ? IMO they seem to have put together a great car and good all round package.","July 22, 2022"
GrecaleNYC,"Didn’t hear the stereo, these were the preproduction units, which did have electric power hooked up so I could see the graphics, etc, but couldn’t hear the engines ☹, waiting for a test drive model to come into the dealer before deciding which one to get. That’s a few months off into the future…","July 22, 2022"
EDZ,"Yes lots of estimated dates being given but no concrete dates. My delivery date for the Trofeo is still only estimated also, cant get any further information either or even if full production has yet started. Did read that the factory was closed at the end of last month due to shortage of components and obviously the on going shortage of semi conductors.","July 23, 2022"
Trident,"SimpsonTide985 said:I already had plans on moving away from my Alfa Romeo Giulia Q4 and into either a new Stelvio Veloce or a used Stelvio Quad late this summer. I’m really happy with my Giulia but I’m looking for a small crossover next. Something that sits a bit higher, has a bit more interior space, but also has an increase of goodies, flare, style, and luxury.So I took a quick look at the upcoming Grecale and after maybe 45 minutes of being really surprised by everything I saw, I decided to put down a deposit on the LE Modena--something I've never done before!I'm definitely hoping for a Blu Intenso/Red color combo.View attachment 171It just really seems to check a lot of boxes, fits my budget, and I really like my local Maserati/Alfa Romeo dealer. While there isn’t a ton of info on the car yet, I like what I see so far.Again, not a done deal obviously. I still might decide on a Stelvio QV if things don’t work out or if a better deal comes around but in any case, my heart is set on the Grecale or the QV.Is there any additional new info out there about release dates? Is there anything else about the LE Grecale Modena that isn't on the website?Click to expand...Congrats on putting your deposit down@SimpsonTide985and welcome to the forum! So far for the release date all I'm seeing it the second half of this year. Have you owned an Maserati before or is this your first one?","May 9, 2022"
SimpsonTide985,"Never a Maserati. I drive an Alfa Romeo Giulia at the moment. I've fallen in love with Italian manufacturing lolI'm expecting the Grecale to feel like a slightly less dynamic version of the Stelvio but with a lot more luxury/prestige/presence/comfort.To be perfectly honest, I'm still torn between getting the Grecale, Tonale Veloce, or a used Stelvio QV. They all have something really great to offer.","May 10, 2022"

SimpsonTide985,"Whoa, 21 mpg combined for the Trofeo model? That sounds too good to be true imo.I would've assumed 21 mpg for the Modena V6 but if they're estimating 21, that'd be a pretty big deal.","May 3, 2022"
Harvey Wiggins,"Width is 7.8"" wider than a Levante so no way to park in a standard parking space makes the Grecale unsuitable for a lot of people.","March 23, 2022"
Trident,The standard parking spot size is approximately 102-108 inches / 8.5-9 feet wide so I think it'll still be usable for people in most areas.,"March 24, 2022"
Mii,"Overall dimension and profile is very nice compared to Porsche Macan. Is width 85.2 inches with mirror extended? The width on Wiki is 1,948 mm (76.7 in), likely with mirror folded.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maserati_Grecale","April 2, 2022"
Harvey Wiggins,"Finally, I found a spec that listed body width and not just mirrors width. Body width is the critical dimension for parking and 77 inches although not great is acceptable. BUT, the turning circle at 40 feet isawful. That is 2 feet larger than the Levante turning circle which is just 38 feet. Grecale is supposed to be dimensionally smaller.","April 2, 2022"
Harvey Wiggins,"I was looking forward to ordering a Grecale but if the Grecale is truly 85.2"" wide that makes it 7.8"" wider than a Levante and impossible to park in a standard parking space. I have to park in such spaces several time a day so no Grecale for me...:-(","April 2, 2022"
Trident,From my understanding the standard parking spot size is roughly 102-108 inches / 8.5-9 feet wide. Are there a lot of smaller spots where you live?,"March 24, 2022"
