dcjarvis,"They had a couple of them at the dealers yesterday when my old man picked up his nbew Giulia Veloce (which was pretty special tbh!).It does look like a BIG car from the front, but inside feels more or less like the Giulia. Boot is a decent size (compared to my 3 series touring) but is a little bit narrow. My verdict was ""Steve"" is a good choice if you like that sort of thing...","September 2, 2017"
cue2,"Car Magazine tested it and it becomes clear why it needs to be competitively priced; the interior is not quite up to the standards of the Audi or Volvo. But it sounds like it drives well, if a little firmly, so if you actually use it rather than sit using the infotainment it could be nice.","September 2, 2017"
PapaSmurf,"The official launch is next Saturday but there are cars in (some, probably all) dealerships & orders have been open since 1st Aug.","September 2, 2017"
JTD_Liam,"Ahh right, I'll cut Alfa a bit of slack for now then. But it wouldn't have hurt to give the press RHD versions for UK road testing I think. It's really not nice driving a LHD vehicle in the UK, and Alfa don't want to give journalists any excuse to get the car marked down.I've seen a couple of dealers post online this evening saying they now have their RHD cars in stock, and unlike with the Giulia it looks like Alfa has supplied more eye-catching white & Misano Blue models. Now all they need to do is a launch advert this week. Trouble is they don't have enough dealers to get too many people through the doors at once :idea:","September 2, 2017"
JTD_Liam,"I thought I'd not seen Misano Blue on the configurator. Having checked, it's not on there, but one of the dealers has a RHD one in Misano. And there was a pretty nice dark green in the brochure but that's not on the configurator either. And when you look at the Stelvio offers it says 'click here for our offer for the Stelvio Milano Edizione' but when you do it redirects to a blank pageIs it just me or does stuff like this really aggrivate!? Have they got anyone in that HQ in Slough that actually wants to be there? :curse:","September 2, 2017"
cue2,"Alfa build batches of cars to get stocks up for launch. The salesman who handed over my new Giulietta told me about the batch of blue diesel Giulietta autos with red leather the uk got sent for the latest model without asking for them.

Deman77,That’s a reasonable concern. I would not go with the cheapest guy or someone who is nearest and I would specifically discuss the point of what they do if they damage the wheel or break the tyre (occasionally happens during fitting) - the right answer is get you a new one - not a repair. I drive 30min to thetyreshop in chingford - they use plastic heads in the machines to avoid damaging the wheels. My main reason though is they do road force balancing on Hunter machines - it’s extra but worth it.Try to find one that gets lots of business and has some fancy cars get done there and is willing to own up any damage. They would not be the cheapest but your risks are minimal then.,"January 25, 2021"

About a couple weeks ago I received the roof bars, had them powder coated black and later went on to install them…I used a torque wrench to tighten them to 8Nm as per the manual but the plastic “leg” on one of the roof bars snapped… It could be either overtorqued (not very likely) or just user error.In any case I didn’t have much luck finding who the manufacturer is to get replacement parts and ordered a second set which arrived today and finally fitted it.Now the search for the manufacturer continues so I can possibly sell the second set.View attachment 959057Click to expand...Can you confirm, are you talking roof bars (left to right) or roof rails (front to back). If you’ve managed to over tighten roof bars whilst using a torque wrench then they must be faulty. I’ve used Thule bars for the past 30 years, several sets on different cars and always monkey tightened them without issue. Buy cheap buy twice as my old man used to say.","September 3, 2021"
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners,"July 15, 2023"
MultiDoc,"Yes, roof bars (left to right), never had such issue in the past either. The issue is the way the bottom leg is tightened, you tighten a bolt which in turn applies force on a plastic part, I guess doesn’t take too much to brake it off as I found out. I had used a torque wrench exactly because of fear of over tightening that part. I guess either the torque wrench is out of calibration or the bar leg isn’t strong enough.Anyway, I ended tightening them by hand using reason and feel alone.","September 3, 2021"
cue2,I’ve got that set and having difficulty understanding which part you snapped. The cover or the plastic encapsulated clamp bit? And I don’t think they’re cheap. I bought amother bolt-thru adapter barrel for the Thule bike carrier recently and that was extortionately priced.,"September 3, 2021"
MultiDoc,"Yes, the bit of plastic that holds the threaded barrel in place so the outside bolt can tighten the leg onto the roof rail.As for cheap or not, to be honest I think the oem bars are overall well made and very well priced, especially in comparison with Thule; Thule although are regarded and rightly so as very good or even top of the range, their pricing is at least ridiculous","September 3, 2021"

I left top two unch outside temp and time but the bottom right was the utterly useless compass and I changed it to much more handy remaining range. Was buried in infotainment somewhere.You also have two options for what they call a “performance page” on the dash screen in each mode. I changed the G-force for race and dynamic to be some extra gauges. For N and A I changed consumption history chart and the little planet thingies to instant consumption gauge - the line at the bottom is tricky to read.,"September 18, 2021"
MultiDoc,I suspect this an MY21 only available option? Couldn’t find a way to change these on mine (my18),"September 21, 2021"
Deman77,You are not missing much. The gauges page is only useful for warming up - two of them are acceleration and braking % which is pointless and the last one is water temp. The big digital speed page is more handy the way this thing gathers speed. I think g force one would have been good if it was leaving the trace of your largest readings for you to look at on the straights. As it stands trying to look at that screen when pulling high g force is not safe.The instant consumption gauge in N is a bit more useful if you will be trying to squeeze more mpg.

To me that only works in the dry. when it’s wet even if the tyre is warmed up you probably can’t keep enough heat in it for it to stay really pliable.I have the inverse problem in summer on my all year round winters. When I give it beans in the dry the tyre stays hot forever and it’s starts getting squishy and floaty after it overheats. But when wet it is as good as summer and when I come back from the drive the tyre is almost ambient temp.,"November 2, 2021"
Deman77,I probably panicked too soon. They bumped all forecasts by 3-4 degrees over next 10 days and looks mainly dry. Oh well at least there will be no skippy from cold and saves my pz4.The pz4 was very grippy and pliable once warmed up this morning at +5 on the way to the tyre shop. It’s a brilliant tyre the oem.,"November 4, 2021"

Seems odd to me not to be able to buy in advance.,"November 4, 2021"
cue2,I enquired but wasn’t offered it in advanced. Perhaps I could use Lipscomb to do the 3rd service and then buy the plan when I collect the car.,"November 4, 2021"
Muz,"Didn’t I see that you bought from Thames in Slough? I bought my Stelvio from them and also the service plan in January, very smooth and easy transaction once it was available. £649 for services 2-4 on a petrol VeloceHad the second service done at Monza last week including a warranty claim on a cracked plastic gear shift top cover. Good, efficient and friendly people.","November 4, 2021"
MultiDoc,"Deman77 said:On homologated scorpion winters now and they are not as pliable. Feel slightly harder. I thought it was my suspension settling in in spring that improved the ride but it must have been the tyre swap. I could run pz4 at the top recommended pressure and it felt perfect but scorpions seems a bit stiffer and bumpier - about one damper setting difference (though in tyres you feel it in down move not in rebound) . They are less noisy but I will probably drop pressure towards lower end to see if I can improve the comfort. Pz4 are actually more comfortable at higher pressure - probably better match to spring rates. Luckily qv recommended range is 5psi wide. It could be that they are heavier and higher unsprung weight reduces comfort.did alignment today too. I never checked from factory but at 5.5k now I had both fronts toeing out slightly (effect is tram lining and inner tyre wear) - now toed in. Caster is out of range 10-20’ below the 80’ range but it’s the same on both wheels and not adjustable so I will live with that. Cambers was fine.Rears were perfect.Did roadforce balancing on wheels and all alloys are perfect again but both driver side tyres were a bit out. They couldn’t improve it as alloys are perfectly balanced so no matter how you rotate the tyre against the wheel you can’t get overall balance to improve. They said may be they are a little misshaped from storage (I did turn them quarter turn every couple of months) and that may improve as they get driven a bit. They said it should not affect the actual weights balancing so it can only get better or stay the same.was probably a bit too early to change to winters with forecasts improving but I really hussled them in the way home at 8c and they were not warm when I arrived so will not worry till well into teens. They certainly felt better in crossover temperature dry than cold pz4 did and I did not feel paranoid pushing them or stepping on the brakes - just not as creamy as warmed up pz4 - something to look forward to in spring.Click to expand...Thanks for the update, appreciated. Are you balancing the rims separately and then the rims and tyres together ?","November 4, 2021"
Deman77,In road force balancing they spin the rim to see how balanced that is then mount the tyre at correct pressure and apply force to squish it like when the car is driven. Then they see how balanced the whole thing is. Then they rotate tyre vs the rim a little to achieve the best overall balance. Sometimes they can’t really get it within tolerances. The weights bit goes in somewhere there but it is sort of independent. That’s how I understand it.,"November 4, 2021"
Navlet,Are heated windscreens an option on the Stelvio ? Our used Stelvio we got this summer doesnt have one but does have heated seats and steering wheel. I really miss it as the Volvo and Evoque both had heated windscreens which would clear in seconds.Having said that with the OEM battery....,"November 5, 2021"
cue2,The 159 had a heated screen at one point. I think it’s patent by Ford has probably finished by now.What Cars Have Heated Windscreens? | Stable BlogAre you interested in knowing what cars have heated windscreens? This article goes into detail on what the technology does and which cars have it available.www.stablevehiclecontracts.co.uk,"November 5, 2021"
Deman77,I wouldn’t have one. For an occasional convenience you see the lines if the sun is just right. Really bothers me.You can install an aftermarket fuel fired heater- webasco - that has a benefit of getting the engine to working temp quicker too. I loved that on my Volvo as 4cyl diesel took forever to warm up. It’s battery intensive but the whole battery in Alfa thing is a myth. All that will happen is lower Soc will force full alternator programme - this is what I see on my battery after longish disuse.,"November 5, 2021"
alfaitalia,The only thing that I missed on my wife's old1992 Ford Orion Ghia was the heated screen.......got rid of frost in under a minute and misting in about 20 seconds. I'm amazed such a safety giving think was not made mandatory. In the winter you see loads of cars in the morning with only the bottom half of the window demisted.....no one wants to wipe it or it leaves marks....and leaving the car to idle to warm up and clear it should be avoided on all modern cars and wont work on dervs anyway. I needed to look for it to see it....you shouldn't really see it as you are focussed on the distance rather than the screen.,"November 5, 2021"
Deman77,are you sure it’s not rose spectacled memory? The rear screen heaters in all the cars I ever had would take good 3min to defrost - probably less than 5 but definitely not 1. Unless windscreen ones are significantly stronger I see it saving me 2min at most on my 5min idling demisting (I can see it being worthwhile with a diesel) but I would still have to sit there idling. So it may be somewhat more convenient depending on the engine but it would not prevent people not willing to wait driving around with obstructed view.,"November 5, 2021"
Deman77,"alfaitalia said:Much stronger.....no comparison really.....I'm talking your standard scrape off frost here like I've had the last couple of mornings....not sheet ice! It softens really fast then the wipers take it straight of. There are a lot more elements (smaller of course) packed a lot more tightly together than on a rear screen. If it wasn't fast it would kind of defeat the point and people would still have to scrape. Idling an enginel on a modern petrol car does it no good either....start her up, seat belt on, into gear and drive gently. That way there wont be so much excess fuel washing oil off the bores for so long and the cat etc will get up to temp faster. Warming up cars by idling is a thing of the 80s!In this test with thick frost the Ford was driven away after two minutes.....but it clearly could have been wiped away by the wipers rather earlier than that.Click to expand...that does look quicker than the rear. The tough bit is not getting rid of the ice but warming the glass enough that it does not mist on contact with cabin air. If it can do this much in 2min without touching then if it was scraped first or have a bath mat on it, it probably could be on its way in under 30sec.","November 5, 2021"
Navlet,"Heated windscreen would clear in seconds in the cars when I've had it fitted, much better than using a scraper you just press a button. As for lines being visible you would only see them if the light was at a certain level / angle and I hardly ever noticed them.","November 5, 2021"

Deman77,What are the numbers you used on the tyres? Can you post some pictures at acute angle just to see how they sit vs arch extensions.did you notice better ride from deeper tyre wall?,"November 22, 2021"
Deman77,Yes stock pz4 were all over the place in the wet at +5C for me last 2k of rev range in race. They need dry to maintain heat in low temp. Scorpion winters are solid in cold dry or wet and I didn’t feel much subjective drop off even into low teens dry (I am sure they are worse objectively).You need to change your car washing technique. Look at the scratches you left on the arch extension. is that a blister in the top right corner?,"November 22, 2021"

MultiDoc,"I did in part. Had to go through Germany on the way back to get to Sqquadra Tuning (I got the exhaust sound controler installed by Stephan), so managed some quite fast stints on the autobahn but didnt maxed out as there was quite a bit of traffic and also the car was fully loaded to the brim. I had a very enjoyable 30 minute drive in northern Italy though following anothe Stelvio QV (the only QV i saw in all our traveling) and the gent was really good to follow at far from l e g a l speeds close to 200-220km/h for some time. We had a quick chat also when he pulled in for refuelling.","August 14, 2022"
cue2,"The reason for the rarity of Stelvio Quadrifoglia in Italy is the tax;”The price of the stamp of an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is about 1,451 euros per year, but this is calculated without the superbollo. In fact, adding the cost of the supertax, the total stamp costs about 5,251 euros.”","August 14, 2022"
MultiDoc,"Yes I know, i was shocked when i found out what the road tax was in Italy ! The gentleman that was driving the silver QV told me that he's aqtually leasing it so it comes out cheaper and he avoids the exorbitant road tax. His english wasn't perfect but good enough (very raree for Italians) but that's what i could make of his description.","August 14, 2022"

Lost traction spectacularly in race mode on wet roundabout around 7c last Friday - not progressive, just went. Luckily it’s not a Giulia so she righted herself - but it was not a good look. In summer she would just gently step out, even in the wet and then straightens out.","November 25, 2022"

Deman77,Lol. I’ve been in D after I drove it back but after I got paranoid about exhaust I tried Race and then just couldn’t bear to stop using it.It’s a bit silly on full throttle - over before it starts - 30-60 in like nothing and so much drama. So I basically drive it in Race but I don’t floor it but try to modulate the throttle even if I take it to high revs. That lets me enjoy the cornering and the feedback and it’s also a lot smoother experience. I prefer the pop on lower rev shift in race too. Still wish I could hear more of the exhaust from inside. Might start driving with rear windows open.,"November 23, 2020"

Per1,"Deman77 said:My first problem.Do you guys find the car too quiet inside. I was pleased with low road noise and just a hint of wind noise on the motorway journey after I picked it up but now driving around in D valves open (says so on mode info screen) I can barely hear anything - just a distant hum. Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice change from my tractor of a diesel Volvo which also sounded like it was running inside the car but here it’s nothing and the noise was one of the main reasons I bought this thing. I remember it sounded to die for from outside with open valves and I think the one I test drove did not lack for noise inside though I suppose it was less hushed on the motorway for noise. I didn’t complain just going 50-70 and back down in race mode like an idiot for 20miles. But don’t seem to get any of that in my MY20. But I was hoping to hear open valves all the time. Did they neuter them with their refinement efforts? Could it be in run in mode for exhaust? It definitely farts on high rev gear change but everything sounds very distant and hushed. I didn’t buy it to bother other people - I want to listen to it but I cannot hear much. Do you open windows to hear? Should stereo be on to get the engine noise supplementary noise? I will listen outside tomorrow perhaps my flaps are not open.Click to expand...Just reading through this post and I agree - inside the care is quiet - the Quadrifoglio I test drove had more sound inside, and I think that may be down to the 19 onwards models seem to have insulated glass in the doors - look at the top of the glass - it appears to be two thinner sheets with a laminated sheet between where as most other cars have slightly thicker door glass but most clearly just a single sheet. I suspect this is part of their aim for luxury and comfort in the cabin.","February 18, 2022"

Sounds a whole lot better now of course and nice to know the sound track is there without needing to disconnect all safety systems!The menu option to open valves in all modes that was meant to be there on 20 and 21 models appears to have been excluded in the EU for some reason, but is available in the USA.","February 18, 2022"

Deman77,I don’t understand. Wouldn’t it be just Race sound in any mode?Or you like the race noise without the car being on edge with all the other settings? I imagine it could sound a bit unpleasant in 3cyl mode which engages off throttle low revs in lower modes once engine warms up. That sounds a bit cheap and unbalanced with flaps closed. Wonder what it is like with them open.,"May 24, 2022"

Deman77,This is it. It feels like the car is labouring in too high a gear.You can’t hear the exhaust in the car but you can hear the absence of the exhaust note - In 6cyl exhaust sounds very good even with the valves closed. With 3cyl on it’s like the exhaust is completely turned off. I was wondering if that no sound might change with open valves and what that would sound like.,"May 25, 2022"
Welshrugby,"This morning i drove the car in N mode and valves open. Warmed it up before I switched in to A mode, the sound from the exhaust hardly changed, if at all. Tried in all modes and sound was pretty much the same whether at standstill or when driving.If you stand at the back of the car whilst it ticks over, switch the valves off and it is almost silent. Do you want silence from your 510hp beast or should it be allowed to breath","May 25, 2022"
Deman77,"Mine has different (deeper) sound when idling in all modes.The exhaust is always quietest when coasting even in race even though it’s open valves and cylinders do not deactivate - I would slow down towards traffic lights almost no sound, then gear disengages and it turns on this deep rumble.perhaps it burns richer mixture at idle","May 26, 2022"

Deman77,Yes have dealer issued paperwork for service but will pester Alfa for 5y warranty like you did. 5/5/5 was a big deal for me with such an expensive engine plus it was a first step to help me get over the wall of “Alfa will break” disinformation campaign.,"January 5, 2021"

Deman77,"5-0-5 was a big consideration. By the time the car was built my20 could be had quite a bit cheaper especially from stock but adjusted for the cost of warranty extension and 0% apr that fca finance gave me it was not much difference.I do think that whoever thinks they have it, chase up AR to make sure it’s on the system so not arguing with dealers.","February 3, 2021"
cue2,Mine was put onto the system last January at the first service by the dealer I bought it from. I didn’t use them again for this year‘s service.

It took a few weeks to get a cheque for the £500 back from them.,"February 3, 2021"
mrpbailey,"I just booked in for a 1st service to find it was already included, nobody had told me that!I also enquired about the service care packs, and apparently car has to be 1 year old before it can be activated.

MadMotoUK,"Shite isn't it?On the same subject, I'm actually impressed with Ford for once. Changed the original front pads on the Transhit a few weeks back, 38.5k and the discs are still good. Changed the rears last week at 44k, discs have a tiny lip but they'll be ok till the next change. Considering it's a 3.5t van and is always pretty much on it's weight limit, I don't think that's bad at all. Fitted Bosch pads as they give much better bite than the OEM ones. Probably won't last as long though but braking performance is notably better now.","July 5, 2023"

wictod,"This is a weird one and have searched all over the boards for some other cases of this..Anyway, randomly but getting progressively more frequent I get this strange sound when accelerating, it's only on the acceleration sometimes at the start of the pedal being used but sometimes part way through a long burst, say going up a hill..The sound is very odd like the sort of sound you'd get pinging a steel ruler on the edge of a wooden table and shortening the ruler to change pitch, almost cartoon sound effect like... as soon as you lift it stops. You can't recreate it at will so I can't capture it either. Sounds is very prominent over the engine almost like it's in the dash somewhere but I'm sure it's engine side.Any Ideas? 2018 280 Specialie standard setup","July 12, 2023"
Deman77,Does it replicate when you rev in neutral or just with gear on? Have you tested to see if it’s only in certain gear(s) or all? Is it limited to parts of rev range or all across?,"May 3, 2023"
wictod,"I've never managed to get it to do it in neutral although I haven't spent a lot of time testing it because it's not every time you rev it happens.. I'll have to use the paddles to quote gears as I normally drive full auto but more often than not it's when you accelerate hard and very infrequent when your just going on the gas.. so a 85/15 split in favour of hard.. Coming to think about it, it's not happening in the first 3 gears but the box is so close it could be 4 or 5 onwards, never pulling out of junction from stationary. Had it the other day and it sound like a ratchet type noise, short burst whilst on the gas like opening a crock lock if you remember them.","May 3, 2023"
wictod,I took the intake off and managed to reach the fan.. there was maybe 1.5mm - 2mm play along the shaft push/pull and not really any play side to side.. Once you get through the 3000rpm and max boost it doesn't make any noise at all.. Cheers,"June 6, 2023"
TheCrazyCabbage,"1.5-2mm of play does seem a little much. What do the impeller blades look like, is there any damage or bent tips?","June 24, 2023"

wictod,"I'll try and find some time to take all the intake off again, from what I've been told, there should be a small bit of play along the shaft but none up and down.. at some point in the near future i'm taking to my local specialist to have all the exhaust bolts and fixings checked they're tight.. it has also been suggested that under pressure some of the gaskets could leak causing vibration. There's no smoke or reduced mpg either.. driving around without pushing it the engine is very smooth..","June 24, 2023"
TheCrazyCabbage,"Correct, a little in and out is good, but nothing up/down or side to side. 1.5-2mm in/out is a bit much though.Its also true a badly fit gasket can cause similar noises - especially metal gaskets! I have had a Zafira with a bolt missing from the intake piping, and 2 vehicles, (t5 transporter and a transit connect) with bolts broken on the exhaust manifold causing a noise akin to a dying rodent, especially at full boost","June 24, 2023"
wictod,"Thanks for your input... whatever the problem is it's also causing some level of vibration as seen in the video, although not felt in the cabin, the camera was crudely mounted on the inner wing with duct tape and you can see the fluttering of the image at the same time the noise occurs..","June 24, 2023"
wictod,"I had exactly the same thoughts about the dash until I strapped a phone onto the inside of the wing to record it.. it sounds much worse from the engine bay.. It could still be vibration but it's related to the boost, I can't get it do it in the A mode at all no matter how hard I try but in N & D it can be recreated at will? It seems to be quite rare, not one of the ""don't worry they all do it type of sounds""","July 11, 2023"
stelviowner,"If yours does it and mine does it perhaps it is not so rare after all. If however it seems that your turbo is about to self destruct please let us know. Mine started to make the noise at quite a modest mileage therefore suggesting it is not a wear and tear fault. Still, I just hope that it keeps on doing it. Perhaps the turbo blades are going supersonic now that they have worn in, the acceleration remains brisk even with the noise happening.","July 12, 2023"

I did a dry run to my amp (still waiting on my load resister) and then hooked them back up to themselves, and still getting the error.

Of course, I got the ""Stereo System Unavailable"" message. I know that I have to get the resistor inline, and waiting for it to come in, but my question is, when it goes into that mode, does it disable all speakers, or only the ones effected? My issue is I ran all the wires to the luggage compartment, so I hard wired the speakers back up from there, and still getting the issue. There may be another issue, but nothing is working currently.

brisc,After 18 (nearly) continuous years servicing of my Alfas by Keith at Monza Sports (highly recommended BTW)- I've emigrated to Inverness and hope for someone who can apply the same standards to my Stelvio near Inverness.Any recommendations please?,"June 18, 2023"
stelviowner,Following this with interest because we recently bought a holiday home in Embo which is 45 miles north of Inverness. Before coming this far north we bought an Astra because it is much more likely to be familiar to garages in the wilds rather than my Stelvio. The idea is to have a car where you can get the bits from the local paper shop rather than exotic parts that are unobtainable. There is a Fiat dealer in Inverness but no idea how good they are. My Stelvio is staying near the dealership where we mainly live.,"May 14, 2023"
brisc,"Thanks for your reply.I had a fabulous 156 GTA previously and found out to my great cost what a risk it is to step away from a trusted Alfa mechanic. In fact Monza did such a good job on that car, they bought it back from me.You don't see too may Stelvios up here (a shame because the roads are fabulous where not potholed).I'm sure there must be a great Alfa mechanic somewhere within a couple of hours drive- Ashington, W Sussex is just too far!","May 14, 2023"
brisc,"stelviowner said:There is a Fiat dealer in Inverness called Donald Mackenzie. No idea how good they are, maybe fantastic, maybe awful. If you ask Google for an Alfa dealer in Inverness that is where you end up. They seem to do Fiat and associated brands, the feedback is decent but in reality, no idea. Perhaps you could take one for the team, try Donald Mackenzie out then report back. If you come up with a convincing solution to this issue perhaps let us know. I decided to buy the Astra simply to have a car for Scotland, leave it up here when we go back to our English home and have it serviced and repaired in the local area, hence the decision to buy an often encountered car. Unless the Alfa dealership offer a loan car I am stuffed anyway because I am 45 miles North of you and I can't be asked with the buggeration of public transport which is sparse and/or expensive. If we were to move up here permanently I would probably sell the Stelvio with huge regret but accept that in this area support is scant.

wictod,"You'd have to pull it out from the fuel flap assembly and check inside it to see if it already started rusting, my guess is the seal between the two section lets in water or it getting in through the rotating lock piece... the top section of the actuator with the electrical connection can detach from the main body (some careful prising off where it pops together) ... oddly enough the actuator is almost identical to the Audi A3 A7 one on amazon for £15.. with the only exception the Audi Amazon version has a square 2 pin connector, the Alfa has an oval 2 pin connection so some it may be possible to use the top off the original and fit it to the amazon version and then seal it properly with some silicon sealer..","June 11, 2023"

I was doing a job in London once and had to return to the car outside the job frequently, opening and closing to get stuff out the boot. I noticed a Tesla park up as I was approaching and he locked his doors and I couldn't get mine to open for about half hour.

Usually 4-5 presses of the button does the trick and once its gone once it will unlock and relock quite happily.

Deman77,"Started getting intermittent ticking from front outside wheel. Sounds like something in the calliper or a stone or screw in a tyre. Level car it happens on full lock (more left, less right) or with straight wheels when weight transfers forward during braking, or sweeping left turn when weight transfer into front outside wheel.First I thought stones stuck in sipes in winter tyres but having taken them all out that is not it.The sound is metallic and intermittent.I expect the usual three week diagnostic wait at the dealer, so would be good to have some ideas.","April 28, 2023"

Deman77,There is an advisory to deal with it from Alfa. I think they fit a spacer. Meant to be fitting one soon. I realised my tyres were nearly 2psi over spec max just before going on a long trip. I wonder if that was causing the issue. I’ve done all the way to Scotland on correct spec pressure and not heard the tick but I need to try in a quiet car park on full lock to make sure. I prefer not to fit the spacer of I can help it.,"April 6, 2023"
Isotope,"When you say outside do you mean the wheel on the outside of a corner or is it just on one side? I would be very interested in the Alfa Advisory or is this just the Ackerman affect again, noticed by a new owner??

stelviowner,"I am going to be leaving my Stelvio for a short to medium time on my drive at home but not in use. Not possible to run it periodically so I am considering taking the battery off it to save the battery. I did this once before with the battery left on the car for a shorter time and it was real touch and go getting the car livened up again.Looking for guidance concerning the shut down and restart.By disconnecting the battery to remove it, I am unable to power close/lock the tailgate therefore my plan is to open the bonnet and jump lead the battery to the under bonnet engine jump lead points in order to power the tailgate shut, and to lock the doors. Disconnecting the battery from the jump point and dropping the bonnet closed should leave the car secure and not killing the battery.To restart the car at a later date my plan is to open the drivers door with the physical key from the fob, open the bonnet, attach the battery to the jump lead point to hopefully get the tailgate to unlock and open then re-attatch the battery and hopefully start the car.Does this sound feasible or am I making a huge mistake. It is not practical to leave the car on a maintainer instead.Helpful advice welcomed.","April 16, 2023"

legacy,"Hi I have searched various threads for info but wanted information on my specific problem.Whilst driving in the wind snd rain the car just came to a stop. All the engine check lights came on like a Christmas tree. I tried to restart the car but no joy. I carry a OBD and checked for errors there were three, sorry can't remember what they were, I think fuel rail, canbus, low voltage. I tried to clear the errors but they kept coming back. Called rescue and they managed to get the car started using battery pack.Got to the garage and they checked evrything but couldn't pinpoint the exact fault. As a last resort they checked the battery condition and it was down to approx 15%. The battery was only 3 years old and was an Alfa one. They changed the battery and off I went. The stop start and rear screen still doesn't work, which I'm not bothered about the SS.Why would a low battery cause the car to die? Also why had't the alternator kept the battery at a healthy charge. Never remembering it happening in the old days with just an altenator and lead acid battery.Would love for someone to put some light on the problem.","April 15, 2023"

AshleyJU,"Isotope said:Your spark plugs look okay to me, if a spark plug wasn't working it would stand out as wet or oily, however a faulty coil pack only has to misfire every couple of revs to cause rough running. I don't know enough about the newer engines but it could also be a camshaft (TDC) sensor on it's way out The tensioner and or the serpentine belt has no influence whatsoever on the engine timing so I can't imagine your issues are related to that unless they disturbed the wiring of a sensor related to engine timing. The engine in the Stelvio is longitudinal so it should be very easy to see/find and work on, most things on a transverse engine layout eg Giulietta are much harder to get to and work on because there's engine mounts in the way and or clutch bellhousings and very little clearance between the pulleys and wheel arch bulkheads so again this would be a very rare issue given the work that you have had done? I haven't seen any reported issues with Stelvio Multiair units but oil quality/brand has been an issue on the Giuliettas and Fiats with Multiair units. Hopefully that won't be your issue?Click to expand...Yeah, Spark Plugs don't look too bad really, we swapped coil pack 3 with 1 so should the CEL return and the fault be captured hopefully it will give us more insight. Service-wise, it's always been done at the main dealer, Selenia Digitek PE for the first two then Fuchs Titan GT1 Pro for the last one which meets the FIAT 955535-GS1 standard.

fridaysniper,"Funny one this. The wife took the dog out for a walk. Came back to the car, popped the boot open using the key and put the dog inside his little dog crate. Inadvertently left the key on top of the crate and pushed the button on the tailgate to close - not lock - the tailgate.As it clicked shut she reached for the key in her pocket and realised it is on top of the crate inside the car. No problem, right? The car shouldn't be able to lock the key inside itself.Wrong, I'm afraid. The car was now firmly locked with the key (and the dog) inside and she standing outside.Luckily I was at home and could jump in my 147 to take the spare key to her and unlock for her.So, it seems if you just pop the tailgate without unlocking the car then it is possible to lock the key inside. This was news to me. Maybe because this is the first car I have ever had with a proximity keyfob rather than an actual key in the ignition I have always been super careful to ensure I have the key on my person whenever I leave the car - I don't trust the story that the car won't lock with the key inside and I've been proven right","March 22, 2023"

It was scary to the point that, for the first time in my life (in 35 years of driving), I decided to invest on snow tires. They're okay in the other three season, just nothing memorable.

Now with my 2021 Veloce I've again swapped the Latitudes for Pilot Sports because I wasn't enjoying the drive on the Latitudes.

Isotope,"I did the front brake pads today and I looked at a couple of videos on the net and they all seem to miss a simple thing to make the changing fairly easy. Most of the videos make the point that the pipe to the caliper is a solid pipe, so you don't want to put it under too much stress. What I noticed is that the solid pipe is terminated at a hose clipped to a bracket on the part labelled 5 in the following picture. On the bottom of the bracket the ABS sensor wire, there's not a lot of slack in this and it is held in a rubber grommet, slide this out of the bracket by pushing it down from the car. Then if you remove the two studs and 10mm nuts holding the bracket, you can manoeuvre the caliper around on the flexible hose to use piston spreader. I did try pushing by hand but one piston went in and another came out, so best to use the correct tool, and you won't spoil the caliper paint etc using g-clamps and the like.

stevemacqueen,This review is mostly rubbish. Yes the steering is superb and so are the brakes. Ive never had a problem withmine.Theysmooth and perfectly controllable unlike my previous BMW X3 which were grabby and terrible It drove like truck and the steering was so bad I never knew where the front of the car was. The Stelvio is an absolute pleasure in comparison.The fundamental engineering is superior to the German equivalents but one has to have an engineering knowledge to appreciate it. The power to weight ratio is 170 bhp per tonne compared to the Germans at 100 BHP per tonne. The reason is the lighter weight by 100 kg. Check it out. JM is a ****.,"January 11, 2023"

If I keep the original set to swap back after Easter, I could repeat each year ad infinitum or until my knees can't ski any more.

I'm quite careful with things like that - my 147 fuel flap is not the sturdiest design and I have not broken it in 6+ years. Reason I wrote hinges is because it's just the top part that is broken.

I loved the weighty front end (many on here villified it but the car understeered so well it was amazing) and the fact that you could switch off the traction control! So then got a Giulietta JTDM2 and it was a brilliant car, Alfa diesel engines are really good, when it got to 10 years old it was starting to cost a bit too much to keep it the way I like things. Tyres lasted longer due to no option to turn off the TCS! So chopped it in for a Giulia 2.2 Speciale and that was a really nice car, staggered runflat tyres meant it was quite costly and no amount of tracking visits seemed to increase the tyre life. I went to look at a secondhand Misano blue Giulia and saw my Stelvio in the showroom and was smitten! It is a petrol Veloce and I was at a point where I was starting to think it might be a good time to get out of diesels? Time will tell if that was the right thing to do at the time, the diesel performance and economy is quite remarkable, you can go everywhere at 100mph and still get around 35mpg!! I know what you mean by the smoothness of the Stelvio and despite being that little bit taller than a Giulia it still corners pretty well and the tyre life is also very even. I'm at 15 months old with about 15k on the tyres and still got about 4mm all round! I have never got more than 8K miles out of any tyre on any other car in my life and I don't spare the horses!

Enjoy your Stelvio and if you ever want to sell the 147 give me a PM!Click to expand...My 147 is the 1.9 JTDm 16 valve Sport Q2. Lovely, lovely little car and so much fun to drive. This one came standard with 150 bHp and I have had it mapped to around 180 or thereabouts. The first map was too aggressive and while the car was fantastic to drive (crapped all over anything that tried it on with me) the spiders and cups didn't like all the torque. I had it dialled down to about 180 bHp and it's still very nippy. I have had all the normal issues addressed (EGR and swirl flaps deleted, new Ducati Corse clutch, suspension completely refreshed etc etc. I looked at selling it but the offers I got for it was insulting to say the least.

This could just be generic for Stelvio rather than specific to the Quadrifoglio but maybe a glimmer of hope?I'm pretty sure it wasn't listed when I configured a MY19 Quadrifoglio.,"July 18, 2020"
Deman77,"That is a good sign. I was going to ask about this. However, after it went online first it was listing 19in wheels as standard. Having said that, it was fixed by the time i was ordering a couple of weeks later but the tow bar did not get removed. So still some hope.","August 25, 2020"
Deman77,Reached out to customer services. The answer is no tow bar for my20 Qf. I then rephrased the question - is there a Non zero towing limit for my20 and a different person called me and said no. I don’t think they lose enough Qf orders from this issue to justify the application for homologation.Until we see the chassis plate with a zero limit on it there is a glimmer of hope. But I think they would have publicised it if they went to the effort of arranging this not to put off those for whom it’s a dealbreaker.,"September 2, 2020"
Deman77,His name is Chris Mann. Says so on the photo. Try them on linked in or Facebook. Can’t be that many.on more serious note I’d be keen for the same reason.,"September 5, 2022"
W1NST,I always thought you couldn’t fit a tow bar to a Stelvio QV. I have been towing my 1600kg caravan with a Stelvio 2.2 Diesel 210 bhp for the last 3 years and it has been excellent. If you only need to tow occasionally would the 280 bhp petrol not suffice as that must still be a hoot to drive if my 210 bop diesel is anything to go by?,"September 10, 2022"
MultiDoc,"I haven’t been able to find any contact info on Mr Christopher Mann unfortunately. He appears to be in his 70s and with a quite a long history with Alfa etc. it’s definitely doable to fit a tow bar on the QV, even the oem one fits fine. The issue Id like to clear is how you do this in the uk while not braking the law or finding yourself in trouble with insurance/mot etc.The hunt continues I guess. I’d be grateful if anyone with a Stelvio QV that has a tow bar to please post.","September 11, 2022"
alfaitalia,Look at the weight plate on the Stelvio.....if the gross vehicle weight is the same as the gross train weight or the gross train weight part is blank (like on my wifes old SLK) then you cant legally fit a bar whether you can find one or not. Post a pic of the weight plate if you med help.,"September 11, 2022"

cue2,"Not long ago the Stelvio was acclaimed for being the fastest turnover on the used forecourts of the U.K.Depreciation for me is £1.40 per mile but WBAC are constantly trying to buy it since I checked for a value, just out of interest.

Going back to your original request I know most of the diesels have foglights, not sure what option headlights were available in 2018 but if you have a choice make sure you get the 35W, my Speciale was 25W and that was about the one thing I could criticise on the Giulia.

Setting aside the fact that the Stelvio is not a luxury brand, like many of the German and British rivals, let's recognize that, although, interior quality is not bad, it is indeed not on par with other vehicles in the same price range (albeit luxury); we have wind noise on the lower part of the front doors (I've never heard the door clang though), entry-level Chrysler parts (turn signal and wiper levers, window switches and A/C controls) that don't have any premium feel to them and a few fit and finish things that are also inherited by the Chrysler influence.This car is great, not because of its interior, but because of its looks, the way it drives and the amazing engine it has, that's what we're paying for and why we're willing to overlook the other shortcomings. I went from a Volvo V90 to the Stelvio QV because of the looks, engine and driving dynamics, the rest was a downgrade beginning with the size. A fully loaded Volvo V90 costs 25-28% less than the QV, yet interior quality, interior materials, cabin insulation, amenities (massaging and ventilated seats, adaptive cruise control, B&W sound system, HUD), and infotainment are better...how do you sell that to a buyer driven by facts and not emotions? We've talked about it in the forums, people that buy the Alfas are more willing to give up certain things for the driving experience Alfas give you versus a Porsche Macan that compromises some of those in the name of comfort and luxury.

bquin,Have a 2021 Stevio Sport that I just took to the dealer for the first year service prior to the scheduled time due to a change oil message. They serviced the car and the change oil message was removed but they cannot reset the scheduled maintenance required message that now says I need service in 900 miles or 34 days. They have tried to reset it multiple times to no avail. They now say they want to try a software update to see if they can reset it. I don;t think they have clue.

Or that the wheel hub doesn't run freely.. According to the dealer the aggressive camber means that the tyres are attacking the road and this is what I feel in the steering wheel.,"June 15, 2022"
Deman77,"That seems a bit far fetched. Yes the car responds like a sports car in the bend and suspension geometry helps but I feel it only happens when you lean into it. When rolling straight and steady it feels fairly free. May be check your geometry in case smth is out of whack.you should be able to see it through uneven tyre wear, poor consumption or steering pull.

The only strange sensation I get is when accelarating around a corner there appears to be an extra delay before you get the extra power in the turn? Could that be torque vectoring or is it just the QV's that have it? Also why does ESC intervention cancel ACC on what I think are fairly gentle bends?","June 15, 2022"

pocholin,Deman77 said:Idling engine out of gear needs to burn more fuel to turn it over than the engine in gear coasting down or going downhill because the kinetic energy from the wheels is turning over the engine. So turning to neutral as fuel saving feature is a myth. It’s also less safe. I doubt A mode does that. My Volvo used to turn the engine off when coasting in eco mode but i did not see QV do that in A.I also see almost no gear changes at 60-70 dual carriageway grind as QV can pretty much pull in 8th at light throttle. N chases high gears like crazy - I would sometimes override to shift down in auto in urban traffic as I know I need to slow down and it would be in 7th at 35mph. I doubt A would be even more conservative. I suspect reduced boost/power is pretty much all it does differently.Click to expand...A mode does use neutral when coasting down but you must be steady at 65 MPH minimum for it to work and no faster than 96 MPH.

Finally solved the ’turbo’ issue after 4 months( about 10 trips to the dealer ,with no courtesy car available EVER) , to be told the car needed a new front wiring loom , ok fix that please , then to be told the car needed a full wiring loom……… to which the dealer said , we will change the looms but we are not responsible if we damage or mark anything !!!! Are you being serious ,so we again called Alfa in Milan , who would not bend !! yes that’s Alfa,s company policy , so they wanted to strip the whole interior out of a £75k car because the whole wiring loom was faulty , and even tho it was still well under warranty , they wouldn’t change anything the totally incompetent dealer may have damaged or marked .after 5 months of arguing with Alfa I gave the car back at the garage I bought it from ( John Holland in Sheffield) who throughout the whole affair where brilliant and I got a full refund !!!I have a couple of friends who had leased / bought new Guilia’s with very similar stories , crap dealers , unreliable cars , Alfa UK totally uninterested / unhelpfullI wouldn’t touch a new Alfa even if they where the last car company in the world , I have a 147GTA which I love , obviously never goes near an official dealer , I‘m looking at a spider just now ,new Alfa’s( and their dealers ) are not in the same league of dealers like BMW, MERC,even Ford , never mind Porsche ….I also have a 2010 997.2 which I have owned for 6 years ( along with a Macan I replaced the Stelvio for ) ,totally professional service in every way ,absolutely nothing has went wrong with either car ( over many years I have owned various 911’s apart from a couple of very minor issues all good ,hence why I keep going back )the dealer knows what he is talking about and had a courtesy car pre booked for a service.I have always loved Alfa Romeo ,I am Italian ,I have been to the wonderful museum in Milan to look at all the glorious past Alfas ,BUTI will never consider a new Alfa ever again ,as far as I’m concerned they don’t make new cars !!!i seriously doubt they will survive long term ,the company is totally incompetent from the very top to the very bottom …..I laugh when people mention them as in the same league as Porsche , I would far rather drive an Alfa Romeo everyday , but , my head rules my heart now , no car or car dealer is perfect , Alfa are not even competent!!!!such a shameClick to expand...Stay salty, I guess.","April 29, 2022"

SteveeGee,"I find DaB coverage is fine, but there is a problem with the implementation in the Stelvio.I asked the dealer to check at service but there is no known fix or update.

Deman77,It was mentioned before. It’s not common. It would cost you a fortune out of pocket for real cf trim (smth like 300 notes I would think for that panel and may be even more with OEM premium). It should get fixed under warranty. Stelvios don’t crash anywhere near as often as giulias so you will not have much luck from scrapyards.The trouble is it is likely a dodgy batch of panels so others may be heading the same way soon. So I would only accept it if they fix under warranty and give you 12m warranty on remaining panels.

alfaitalia,"pocholin said:The OEM filter box is indeed sitting at one of the hottest spots in the engine bay, so are these uncovered filters...however, these filters do have the ability to filter greater amount of air per second, so that should be a gain. When you look at aftermarket CAI systems, they don't do anything to isolate them from the engine (like I did)...yet they claim HP gains.They do receive cold air from the OEM scoop encircled in the picture, so, it seems to make sense that what I did (with creating some barrier) is more efficient than other aftermarket systems. I'm definitely open to criticism and/or suggestions for improvement though.Talking about less hot places, there seems to be room on the front of the engine, it crossed my mind but then I don't know what to do with the Venturi valves...suggestions?Click to expand...Maybe....but unlike yours they are fed from the front....so the coldest place with the highest pressure. Also the stock filter can flow more air than the motor will ever need even at max revs....so even if yours could flow more there will be no gain due to that. Its not the 80s with old school restrictive airboxes and filters. A quick google will show that most claimed power increases with CAI are bogus with many actually losing power.....unlike the poor filtration from cotton filters....which is very much fact!!Debunking the K&N Myth - Why OEM is BetterBefore spending your money on an aftermarket intake, let's debunk the misleading incomplete info about filtering and horsepower in the sales literature.www.nicoclub.com","April 3, 2022"

Deman77,There is no clutch in the torque converter. Clunking does not sound good.Where QV will be different from others in pulling away is release of the handbrake. QV has dedicated handbrakes on rear wheels and others rely on foot brake pads. So when you are pulling away from parked or when it auto engages on the slopes you would hear a release sound when you pull away - from rear wheels. From what you described “under the bonnet” it sounds like something different.,"March 18, 2022"
Jambo,"thanks - yes, i can release the handbrake fine - its solely from park to drive when hearing the issue on a slope onlyits booked in a week on monday","March 18, 2022"
pocholin,"On the slope, you might want to just release the brake pedal, wait about a full second or second and a half to see if the car smoothly starts moving forward. I've noticed that the handoff is not smooth from being on the brake pedal to accelerator...only when I do as described above, which means I always have to give it time to let go.","March 18, 2022"
manc350,"Jambo said:So i'm told the shudder that i get shifting from Park to Drive is normal and a characteristic of the car.The shudder happens when there is some tension in the gear box (pull away slightly on an incline) and then you stop on the brakes and go to Park.When you next engage Drive the car will shudder/shake. Its not smooth.However, if you engage Neutral before park it will shudder at all. Completely seemless.Mechanically, it does not feel very sympathetic, and surprised the car (software?) does not enact neutral for you in this common case and remove the tension.For now i will stay in the habbit of selecting neutral before park.Has anyone else noticed this... or can recreate?(I didn't notice it on my previous 2.0 280, just this new QV)Click to expand...I have a 2021 2.0 petrol Veloce and see the same when I am driving in traffic if I come to a stop in D, car goes into stop start mode.. when it restarts and you first move i get what feels like a short < 1 second shudder.. if I stop and go into P or N with no SS then this does not happen so seems to stack up .","March 30, 2022"
Deman77,"I do not get shudder other on engaging drive or releasing hill hold. I get a minimal shunt(more the sound than the movement) on uphill when the torque makes the hand brake release and the car moves forward, but never a shudder and never anything that feels mechanically unkind to the car.The only time the car feels odd and vibrates unpleasantly is when the 3cyl mode engages in N and D off power on low revs - sounds and feels a bit like you are labouring uphill in too high a gear. But that is definitely normal and mild and you need to know what to listen for. So if what you are feeling is more annoying than that I would keep looking.","April 1, 2022"

When I talk to Alfa Care, they blame Arnold Clark as they are their 'eyes and ears on the ground' and they could not diagnose a fault. (I suspect its a case of computer says no).

Stared looking around without clue, no help, but some sensor caught my eye. when I had a fault it was open, when all was working short. I tried to google any info, but was nothing on this part number, except that this company does plenty of types of temperature sensor with PTC/NTC/RTD characeristics, this one was not specified, must been custom for heater manufacturers or so. I started suspecting it is fuse, one time use, just got like crack inside/dry joint. I called serviceman for the part, he said no way to get just the sensor, I googled similar, it was many times said that part was available in past, but later they stopped supplying it - I guess for forcing people to replace expensive part of heater or going for new and give them plenty of money. I found on ebay in italy such sensors for like EUR50, but called guy if he doesn't have some old heaters so I can look for spares.

Deman77,alcohol is still hydrocarbon just made out of crops instead of extracted from the ground so you are not producing less carbon by burning it just recycling some of the stuff that is already above ground so releasing less of the ground captured carbon.developing countries’ petrol retailers are decades ahead of us on this.

So if actual economy is worse than that there is probably drop in engine efficiency.

Muz,You’d think that dealers who can’t sort problems would flag up with Alfa though. Your excuse for them doesn’t hold water imo. Just because they didn’t sell the car SHOULD make no difference on sorting warranty claims.No wonder Alfa dealers have such a bad reputation. Weren’t Beechdale the ones who handed a brand new QV to a dodgy backstreet valet company for preparation? The one where the video appeared of the guy washing the car and filming revving the nuts off it? Apologies if I got that wrong,"January 28, 2022"
cue2,Beechdale pile-em high in just the way the new boss of Alfa Romeo wants to avoid by the “built to order” future. If their way of trading means they don’t see the value to the marque of being helpful to all owners it can’t be helpful but we don’t know the whole story of the car concerned. Perhaps the agency dealership model will help?,"January 28, 2022"

Navlet,"Back to the OP.Im sorry to hear of your misfortune Heather and yes I think you have been unlucky. Problem is Auto 100 are unlikely to have seen many of these cars and like most dealers they are only interested in selling not after sales so willl be unwilling to help you.I live in Nottingham and would only take my Alfas to Research at Nuneaton for new cars , AF1 or Italiatec for used.I hope you get it sorted, and that you will be able to love your car soon.","January 28, 2022"
cue2,"Most brands try to keep the cars in their own networks , mainly for residual values , but it’s unfortunate if they go to dealers who don’t know them or have any commitment to serving the customers.","January 28, 2022"
Zyp,Interesting - I’m also in Notts and had thought I’d use Beechdale for servicing etc.I did actually go to Research when I was looking to buy (they didn’t have a QV for sale and I ended up buying one from Sytner Tamworth) and quite liked the vibe there.Do you take yours to Research for servicing?,"January 29, 2022"
Navlet,"Yes I do use them to service the Giulia and Stelvio which we purchased from them.Its a bit of a drive but they are very good to us, we had a problems with the Stelvio AC and bonnet release which they sorted and gave us a courtesy car both times. Alfa dealers get a bad rep but these are good so I want to stay loyal.Stoneacre Chesterfield are closer and I will contact them 30 days before next service as they have offered me a 2 year service plan £449 + VAT. However I dont know what they are like.","January 29, 2022"
Muz,"If it’s an Alfa service plan you can use it an any Alfa dealer I think?Actually I don’t think, I know because I bought my service plan from the dealer I bought the car from who are too far away for me to go to for a service so I used one more local to me, they were very happy to let me do so and even did some warranty work at the same time","January 29, 2022"
Navlet,"When I enquired with 3 different dealers last year about service plans for my then 18 month old car I got 3 different answers. One just said they only offer them on new cars, the other two did but at quite different price points.I know people on here have purchased plans and used them elsewhere but not all dealers seem willing to do this.Seems a lottery but Im not surprised.I will try again this year.","January 29, 2022"
cue2,"Ancaster in Dartford eventually admitted they wouldn’t sell me the Mopar plan as they have their own , which they didn’t try to sell me. That was when they were servicing my Stelvio and it was Mopar plan funded. The fact that they didn’t tell me about the condition of the rear discs , which were an MOT item a week later , disappointed me. They did remove the rear skid pan and replace it with a Veloce Ti version , which I provided , free of charge.","January 29, 2022"
Isotope,"I have used Stoneacre Chesterfield for the Giulia servicing and to be fair they treated me as a premium customer, priority treatment etc, once the appointment was booked it was like they were waiting for me when I got there! However it is a multi franchise servicing centre and the courtesy car was some weird underpowered thing that I can't even remember what it was now, maybe a Daihatsu? It was over a couple of years ago, but being ushered into something so unlike what you have is a tad wearing. I know there probably aren't enough Alfa cars in the pool to provide a equivalent courtesy car but a well equipped Fiat/Jeep would not be a bad courtesy car.","January 29, 2022"

Even if France was more expensive they'd never allow one of them to close, it's just not how France operates, so I fear for one of the Fiat plants in Italy - possibly the one making the Maserati Ghibli & Quattroporte since they could shift production to Mirafiori alongside the Levante for the new models and it's the factory where all product lines are closest to retirement, other than the Serbian plant which will presumably have cost on its side.","February 1, 2022"

They do have a sport button, but so many things missing! The worst part is that if they had proposed the final offer they could go to after the 1 and half hours of being in the showroom at the first point we probably would have bought the car in the first 10 minutes!

JTD_Liam,"I think there was originally a base model 2.2 diesel Stelvio which was RWD only. There might've been one in 'Super' spec too, with the same engine. It was only base model & Super though. As far as I can tell they barely sold any of the lower spec Stelvios with any engine, let alone the RWD version, so I doubt you'll have seen any without Q4.Most i see in the UK are Speciale, Milano Edition & latterly Veloce.","February 3, 2022"

Isotope,"JTD_Liam said:Did they confirm that the RED version was definitely a 1.3 Firefly 150? Only asking as the configurator is still showing the latest 500x as only available with the 1.0 Firefly 120 engine. Not unlike Fiat to make a co*k up with the configurator but I was half expecting them to use the slight facelift to the 500x to harmonise engine choices across 500x & Renegade with the Compass and Tonale as there are new options coming on stream that could replace the 1.3 150 TCT.You pretty much have to say your budget is £50 per month lower than reality to get any chance of them being close, I find. Sometimes I swear they do it on purpose. I'm not sure what happened to the idea that if I say my budget is £270 a month, I might actually mean it, so I feel your pain.Click to expand...It was definately a 1.3 firefly 150bhp with a TCT transmission.

JTD_Liam,"Interesting. Must be a configurator mistake that only one engine option is showing then.I imagine there'll be quite a price difference between the 500x and Tonale, not helped by the decent discounts available on the Fiat. The Jeep Compass that Tonale is based on starts at £29k - I've a feeling the Tonale will start at more than £30k, with the PHEV edging £40k, with the editional Road Fund Licence that brings 😕I'd heard it was June for UK launch too, probably a couple of months after European launch.","February 5, 2022"

Navlet,"Our Stelvio Speciale has 19 inch wheels Pirelli Scorpion tyres.Compared to the Giulia ( Potenza Run Flats) which is poised sure footed and predictable if not a little firm the handling is twitchy, very camber sensitive on anything other than a perfect surface, even going over a painted white line makes it twitch especially when wet. I know being a 4x4 its not going to be the same but we ve had two 4x4s previously and they felt alot better.On good surfaces its fine.Not sure if its the tyres or tracking, would be interested to hear what other tyres people are running and their experiences.","February 1, 2022"

Navlet,After some consideration I decided to get the two rear Scorpion Verde tyres changed. I checked the tread and they were down to 2-3 mm ( fronts 4 -5mm ) and in these cold climates and wet roads I had lost confidence in them.I have decided to go for Scorpion Verde All Season tyres so had them done this lunchtime along with the tracking which was slightly out.I have never had All Season tyres before but their popularity is rising and if the manager of the Tyre shop is true many Police forces and Ambulance fleets are now using them.Time will tell if I made a mistake but on the short drive home they seemed better.,"January 15, 2022"

Isotope,I still get the scrubbing on full lock with the Michelins but they do seem very good. I drive the car pretty hard and the wear rate is really good.

I had never bought dedicated snow tyres for my cars but because they were like summer tyres on the snow. Literally, the second day of snow I decided to stop driving it and get snow tyres since those still had over half of their life in them. They were marginally okay on dry and in the summer but nothing worth keeping. When the time came I changed them with Pirelli Cinturato P7s, All Season, and loved them the rest of the car's ownership.

wictod,Hopefully it's the battery that failed rather than some weird electrical / computer gremlin..  shame the Noco didn't start it.. I've got a similar booster that has come in handy for other vehicles including GTV 3.0.. it had no problems starting that from flat but I did find it needs someone to make sure the connections are really tight on the posts (sort of holding the clips but forcing them to grip).. I also regularly take it out the car and run it down a bit then charge it to be sure it's full..... I never considered a jump start old school as I thought these new cars didn't work like that.. the Mrs has 500x so I know where to go now if I have the same grief..,"January 9, 2022"
Isotope,"Whatever you do if faced with the same problem do not connect to the negative pole of the battery on either car. The Stelvio and Giulia for that matter has a post under the bonnet, really dissapointed the 500x didn't have a similar setup, but there's a nut on the left side of the battery box that provided a good ground. Just wish I knew what caused the issue in the first place? The internal lights are LED's so wouldn't think they would drain the battery overnight but I can't think of anything else?","January 9, 2022"
cue2,I think there’s some potential in the “sticky” radio knob theory since my wife recently waited in the car while I visited my mum in hospital. She wasn’t sure if she’d switched it off after switching it back on while she sat in the car then went for a stroll.,"January 9, 2022"
wictod,Good advice thanks... I've heard that the infotainment power button can be sticky leaving the unit on but I'm sure you'd see that before getting out the car..

Isotope,"You both might have a point because I sat there trying to start the car thinking "" Who needs the ******* radio on right now!"" it kept coming back on as soon as there was enough voltage! I've noticed that the LED in the park brake switch takes about 5 minutes to go off, is this normal?","January 9, 2022"
Maximus84,Yesterday our Stelvio's battery completely died for the second time in 3 weeks. I think the battery was just shot. I was an hour away from home but was able to jump start it. Last time it happened I put it on full overnight charge with a CTEK so it's completely discharged in 3 weeks.Didn't test for a parasitic drain but I've suspected the battery has been dodgy for a while. Ordered and fit a brand new battery today so we'll see how that fares...,"January 9, 2022"
Isotope,"I have the Alfa branded CTEK charger but it is only a battery maintainer, don't think it can provide enough charge to get the car going in less than 12 hours of use but could be wrong? I've now got 2 lights on so looks like it's working, the car is only 6months old so hope the battery has a couple of years left in it?","January 9, 2022"
Isotope,"I did notice the centre console lights seemed to be on for a long time last night, but just thought that was part of the normal shutdown?

Deman77,Did you hear the double beep when locking? If the door is not properly closed it will not central lock and it continues to draw current. Mine goes dark pretty much straight away.Can you also check you don’t have any leads plugged into USBs. I am not sure all USB ports go dead on shut down and with all the condensation in this weather leads could get shorted.,"January 9, 2022"
Deman77,I also would disable keyless access for a while. Handle touch wakes the car up regardless of whether it will get unlocked or not.

Deman77,"It would not double beep and would not fold the mirrors if it refused to lock. I get that sometimes when kids don’t close the doors properly.

Deman77,It drains but it’s not heavy enough for you to run the engine. Certainly not for pottering around. I sometimes do deep interior clean waiting for kids on Saturday morning. That’s an hour of opening closing doors and boot. You can see voltage drop - that’s because battery is called upon but it does not drain an awful lot and bounces back to a decent level. By the time I return home (30min drive) the battery charge is back to normal.

alfaitalia,Common occurrence no matter what make of car or model. The steel hub corrodes to the alloy wheel. Copper slipping those surfaces with a very thin layer or copper slip or other anti-seize will stop it happening again.....just don't put it on the bolts.

As mentioned above though, never on the wheel bolt threads. Still come across this now and again in some garages.

I would insist on their workshop reaching out to the factory techs as they do when they don’t know how to fix smth to advise what should be done in this instance. They should assume it was cold red lined at idle and potentially a few times to get the video right. At the very least oil should be changed if the car was cold revved and not run in yet as oil may now be contaminated. No point asking for freebees - if they want to give smth to create good will - fine, but the important thing is that they support you to do what is necessary.Having said that I do think a mechanic definitely has a need to give these types of cars full beans and drive them how I would. Is it a perk? Yes. But does it also benefit me as a customer? Yes. If they do so regularly, they have a better chance of spotting something odd with one.

I've liked driving long journeys in it and never felt tired even compared to big lux estates before. It does have a real strong what I call self righting when on badly surfaced uneven roads at low speeds it can jostle you a bit (stiff springs and roll bar combination) apart from that comfort is fine the dampers work beautifully.My plan for interior is to visit an automotive trimmer and leather the door cards, steering column shroud put alcantara on some other surfaces such as the gear lever but car would be out of action for some time and I would miss driving it.","October 15, 2021"

andypower21,HiDid you get to the bottom of this as I seem to have the exact same issue !Andy,"October 19, 2021"
MultiDoc,"Either way you can’t go wrong, but I’d suggest you if you find an ‘18 model with full service history and no issues just go for it. As for comparing the Stelvio to the Volvo, in my humble opinion (slightly biased) there’s no comparison at all except for boot space and leg room, oh and towing ability. Other than that they couldn’t be any more different.And lastly, I beg to strongly disagree with the “more technologically advanced” comment; unless we’re talking infotainment etc which for me is at the bottom of the list of any important things to look for in a car. The Stelvio is way ahead in every other department","October 16, 2021"
pocholin,"@MultiDocI agree with you, there's no comparison on the vehicles. I was indeed referring to the infotainment system as more advanced. When it comes to mechanically advanced, I have no doubt the Stelvio wins easily....and that's why I want to get a QV!","October 16, 2021"
MultiDoc,The difference between the newer my20-21 models and earlier ones are merely some very minor aesthetic changes and the upgrades infotainment hardware. So as I said earlier just go for it and save the extra cost and if ordering new will also save you a good few months of waiting.,"October 16, 2021"

Muz,"Which do you use?I had no idea that you could drive the Stelvio by the gearstick until this morning!I don’t get on with the 8 gears on flappy paddles at all and have been driving on auto for a year. It irritates me on twisty roads with hills and valleys as I am used to cars that I drive through the gears and I hate having to drive by brakes.I haven’t actually done more than drive up the drive a bit by gearstick so have no idea if I am going to prefer it yet, but I’m looking forward to giving it a whirl.","October 17, 2021"
MultiDoc,"For commuting/highway I leave it on auto, but for anything else I put it on manual and use the paddles. Never use the gear selector except for selecting reverse and parking.","October 10, 2021"
cue2,“I love the paddles but never use them!”I’m quite happy with the gearbox and the decisions it makes. What am I missing by leaving it to do all the work instead of using those lovely metal devices?www.alfaowner.combefore I realised they’re great to select D.,"October 10, 2021"
Muz,"Deman77 said:don’t think about it as 8 gears - the last two are really for saving fuel and are pointless on the B roads since you don’t really spend much time in them. And if you do use them you will be fumbling with counting down gears or watching gear indicator instead of looking at the road when coming to the bend.Lower gear ratios are very sensible for QV - you get to max out 1st and 2nd below NSL (even 3rd on motorway). I think new cayman gt4 max 2nd is 80mph (basically a show or track car). I imagine it’s even better for 2.0 as you probably get to max out 3rd at NSL and 4th on the motorway.I use 6th as my coasting gear on B roads and it becomes a 6 speed gearbox - makes life simpler. Simpler still, 5 is really for no slowdown bends as it has too low an rpm at 60 to offer any sort of throttle control in the bend. 2-3-4 are really the working gears for bends. So it’s one, two or three blips slowing down into bends to get to the right revs to get you around the bend on throttle - hardly ever need brakes esp in Race. 3rd also nicely holds the car at 30 down the hills in town.I find auto is useless in N - it just guns for 8th gear. In D it’s much much better but since even this logic only downshifts when you brake or stab accelerator (as it should) you are still doing a fair bit of braking by foot. In manual esp in Race it’s possible to drive even quite aggressively with hardly any foot braking. I also find even D auto, as good as it is, can sometimes misinterpret temporary lift off for coasting intent and shift up so I don’t trust it for anything more brisk than 6/10 driving. I find I gain quite a bit more control over the car in manual as you get predictable on throttle steering adjustability in the bends and engine braking when slowing down.Using temporary override for engine braking when in auto is infuriating too as instead of just flicking it once and feel the effect you realise she’s good two gears higher when coasting and your revs barely move so you are shifting down in panic to find a gear that will have enough revs to have any meaningful braking and you are already past where you wanted to start slowing down.I would normally just use auto when warming up first few miles (usually in D as that runs coasting revs a little higher) and if it’s a boring motorway or A road journey. Otherwise - manual. The paddles are fantastic. Fixed position makes it harder to use with the turned steering wheel so it encourages discipline to pick the correct gear for the bend/speed combo. Gear selector has fairly cheap action in comparison plus it’s safer holding on to the wheel when pushing.Click to expand...Interesting, thanks for the in depth analysis. Yes it’s the coming down from 8th that has made me bin using the paddles so far. I’ll have a go with how you are suggesting.Motorways and town driving are a no brainer - automatic all the way","October 11, 2021"
Isotope,I find myself constantly putting the car into the highest gear I can in an effort to improve the MPG. I have a Stelvio 2.0 Veloce and never get more than 22 mpg! I've tried every driving mode for miles and am now trying reverting to E5 fuel. It does seem to be more rewarding over a very short distance so far!,"October 14, 2021"
Deman77,it could still be a heavy foot getting there.To rule it out try running in middle lane on the flat motorway section in 8th at 60 for 2min making sure you are not drafting behind a lorry and having reset thetrip.Takenote of outside temperature and wind speed and direction vs direction of travel. We can ask someone else to do the same and if they get broadly similar mpg (allowing variation for temp and which way the wind blows) you know it’s your driving style and can just relax. If they are massively better you should book your Alfa in.,"October 15, 2021"
Muz,"On trips of 5-10 miles on really busy roads around where I live in the SE I get 18-22 mpg. When I travel further afield generally 22-25. On a trip from Calais to SW France I got 28 mpg with some fast acceleration on overtaking and leaving Motorway tolls with most of the trip at 70 mph+ on mostly motorways.Petrol Stelvio Veloces seem to have high fuel consumption, it’s the price for the size of the car and the performance I guess.","October 15, 2021"
alfaitalia,Back on the subject of paddles....I don't own a paddle ALFA but had them in my Audi A8 4.2 V8.......if I remember correctly I thought they were great and used them all the way back from collecting it in London.......I may have used then once more after that......then I put it into D and never touched them again! Laziness takes over and the auto box was very good. Having such a torquey motor helped I guess.,"October 15, 2021"
cue2,Why just Stelvio Veloces? It sounds like all petrol Stelvios have fuel consumption figures from the 1970s!,"October 15, 2021"
Muz,"I wouldn’t comment on fuel consumption on a car I had never drivenI would assume the less powerful ones have better fuel consumption, as would the diesels?I would have bought a Kia hybrid if I wanted good fuel consumption and a dull drive.","October 15, 2021"
cue2,I know the £2 a mile depreciation I’ve experienced put the fuel consumption costs in the shade but at least I get 30 something per gallon of diesel.,"October 15, 2021"
Deman77,"I wanted to say each to their own, cue, but I really think you should do yourself a favour and get a test drive of qv and say it’s not worth paying double for petrol for the way that thing goes around the bend under acceleration. I suspect veloce is not far behind as it is lighter and same dna and long useful rpm range even if not as powerful. You can jump into mine if you fancy a schlepp to Essex. I’ll find time to take you on some B roads and convert you. Bet you can trade in your fancy bikes to get yourself into a qv and just take up running instead. Running improves life expectancy vs biking too.","October 15, 2021"
cue2,"I run too but not sure I’d run to a QV! I might take you up on the offer though.I tried a 280 Veloce when deciding whether to pay the bubble or get another one with petrol.Probably because it was new , the gear changes were more distinct than the 210 diesel. I always said I preferred the petrol Giulietta to the diesel so perhaps I’d feel the same about the Stelvio. As it is I got back in mine and it felt pretty good so I got the card out and phoned FCA to pay the balance off.","October 15, 2021"
Isotope,"Went on a 40mile drive today in A mode and have managed 38.3mpg! Trouble is that's not fun, D mode is what we as Alfisti's want, so got to pay the price, I did get a better fuel consumption from the E5 fuel though?","October 15, 2021"
Isotope,I had a Giulia Speciale and that did 35mpg no matter how hard it was driven so the Petrol Stelvio Veloce is a proper learning curve. A mode works well to save fuel but I love the performance more than anything! As golden oldies we find it easier to get into and when you want to overtake something quickly and safely you can! I know it's not a QV but its a very nice place to be in! Worst thing about any good new car is that they cost more than a new house in my neck of the woods!!,"October 15, 2021"
wictod,"I rarely use the paddles in my 280 Specialie, since having the Stelvio and its MPG meter it has made me more mindful of the fuel consumption and has made my driving more sedate not like when I had the GTV. Been crawling around in the A mode since this petrol shortage business but switch to D when approaching the Romford Gallows Corner roundabout as I just can't trust the A mode to get me in and out of that place if you've ever been there... I almost exclusively use the 99ron V Power petrol which on long runs in the N mode give me + 35mpg ..","October 16, 2021"
Jambo,"The paddles are great - the car can do everything for you, or it can transform into a weedend toy.I also regularly use the double pull to select neutral, and rarely - but usefull one day - selection of second gear to start. Presumably useful for ice and snow.They feel great to use too. The wife has a TCT giulietta with tiny paddles on the back of the steering wheel, so you end up chasing them round if you get your changes wrong before the bend.","October 17, 2021"

Deman77,Those are pretty extreme zero traction on wheels examples. That is only going to lag on winter surfaces or in mud. On regular surfaces we probably need double the power of QV to experience these sort of scenarios with delays and there would be tyre smoke. But then again his 4cyl drinks petrol like mad.

It has the handling, the performance, the rwd, it is safely usable on bad B roads because of q4, it is fun at legal speeds. Given how good the exhaust sound is I don’t see why you would NOT want to do this to make the whole thing that much better.

Deman77,"It does, but in honesty q I don’t think pre my20 are much better at letting the exhaust sound in. More the wind noise. Besides, you get to hear a lot of the stuff you don’t even hear standing right next to the exhaust - compare start of the video vs what you hear from the speakers. I can actually hear the valves open when switching to Race.The microphone is 3in away from the tip on the inside of the bumper - I wanted it to be splash proof and not have much air moving around it for lower wind noise, though I suspect past 60 it will start picking up wind noise just from the air passing under the car, that’s when I will start messing with equaliser 1k frequency.","May 13, 2021"

I have had the vehicle since the end of July, and the automatic high-beams have yet to turn on even though I often drive a dark country road at night that has no lights and mostly no other cars. The ""auto"" high-beam indicator on the dash is on, and the automatic high-beam setting in the Infotainment system settings is enabled.

cue2,"Deman77 said:Stelvio QV did.I was intrigued by the reviews seriously suggesting it might just be hardcore enough to get the sports car thrills without having to own one or more importantly having to find the time to drive one all in a reasonably usable family suv package. As it turns out it was. I had to take the sports car bit on trust - I just tested that it was not too compromised as a family car. You can’t really get the confidence to appreciate what this thing can do on a B road in a test drive - took me good 700 miles.I ended up getting the Elise deposit back and trading in the Volvo family suv (my kids were well out of prams so I could downsize). I don’t regret it one bit on the sports car bit as there is just no way I would get this much fun out of two cars combo in the last 9 months even if Elise is truly special when you do get to drive it. I’d have to wait for good weather for the semi slicks and have the time for it too. Plus I would not have the confidence to push it to max because it would be rarely driven and had no 4wd crutch to balance my limited talents. With qv even the passengers don’t mind 7/10 driving and on my own I am confident pushing to 9/10 in any weather incl freezing. All you need is a decent stretch of road and you are already in the right car.The external Alfa image is so badly managed though, that unless an existing alfisti you really would only consider Alfa after you ruled out everything else.I imagine mainly people who are fed up with how badly modern family cars drive or want smth a bit different and don’t like the Porsche image would end up considering an Alfa Stelvio.When you do realise that objectively Giorgio platform cars are the best family drivers’ cars by a margin you start looking into owning one. The reliability surveys were fine, the cars are 3-4 model years in which is well past the early niggles stage so I figured reliability odds were in my favour. There was a 5y warranty deal about this time last year which was a sign of confidence from the manufacturer. I also could survive if my car did end up having to spend as much time at the dealer as my Volvo did.As for dealers bad rep, Thames Ancaster, where I test drove, looked respectable enough and had positive feedback on here. I also think some people are a bit snobbish about getting their “premium” vehicle serviced with jeep and Fiat riff raff and that puts them off. I am the opposite - can’t stand pretentious aftersales.Click to expand...“Thames Ancaster”?They are two completely different dealerships.

UK dealers of other marques knock the brand every time they can but know how much enthusiasts will pay for a good low mileage car.

They became more reliable and seem to last a bit longer. 2 years ago I went with the Giulia, loved it a 2.2 diesel really good car but always had a longing for the Stelvio.

That includes using the spare wheel in the rotation if a car comes with a full size spare wheel. Then you will have all 5 to replace at the same time!Lots of smooth highway driving and you will get better mileage from tyres.

These are often done by a third party, so even if you are not buying from a dealership you will be able to get these done.You could always buy some extra fitted mats to have in the vehicle if you want to keep the originals in new condition. Or fit rubber mats if you often have dirty shoes. Or have a spray can and cloth of automotive upholstery cleaner handy in the car for emergencies.","September 8, 2021"
Lioni,"Thanks. I guess I’ll just apply a stain protector (Scotchgard, etc).","September 8, 2021"
alfaitalia,"The stain protection people that do our caravans wont do the carpets. They say that despite what anybody claims if you tread oil, dog poo, chewing gum etc etc into your carpets, no treatment in the world will protect them and prevent stains. So to avoid unreasonable claims the only do the exterior paintwork and upholstery.","September 8, 2021"
cue2,Having two sets works out best as you can alternate them and when one is in use the other can be thoroughly washed and dried.,"September 8, 2021"

cue2,The mats are made from old recycled bottles and sell for high prices partly because that makes the salesman seem more generous when they “throw in the mats” as part of the deal.

Scott_Goozee,"Hi all, I have a Milano stelvio and recently bought four front quadrifoglio alloys which are 9j x 20inch size. They are lovely looking rims and can’t wait to get them on but am stuck on the size of tyre to buy.I have looked online but it’s not obvious what the correct/best tyre size is for this rim. What do others run for the front wheels on their quad rims?I was looking at 265/45/20 size. Want to balancelook vs rim protection.Advise and experience would be appreciated! Thanks","September 8, 2021"
Scott_Goozee,Also any advice from someone doing similar to me would be appreciated as I know these are slightly different size wheels to the standard Stelvio set up! Thanks,"July 28, 2021"

Deman77,255/45R20 101 W,"July 29, 2021"
Scott_Goozee,Cheers for that. Is there a benefit going to like 265-285 though as they are slightly wider so gives some more protection to the rim on kerbs etc?I mean granted the best protection is to drive carefully but accidents happen and my wife has a tendency to climb kerbs when park😀,"July 29, 2021"
Scott_Goozee,Also my current standard wheels are 8j I think with the QF wheels being 9J and the current tyres are 255/45R20 105 V,"July 29, 2021"
Deman77,If they are black and you won’t wash them ignore this but if they are aluminium finish then take them to a detailer before they are fitted and apply ceramic all around. It will make washing a lot easier. Brake dust will not stick. Just soap and sponge or pressure washer. Titan does very strong high heat resistant stuff called Pyro that a few retailers around uk carry. It will cost you a bit but you would have much easier time keeping them clean.,"July 29, 2021"

I was advised that the system uses the QI software to charge the phone and so, as I was overdue an upgrade, I got myself a Samsung Galaxy S20FE which supports QI charging. Over the weekend I went on a fairly long drive and thought I’d see how well the charging facility worked. So, as per the handbook advice, I put my phone screen down in the charging slot. An icon appeared on the screen which looked like a mobile phone with a red lightning strike inside and red radiation lines radiating from it. However, while driving the message ‘Foreign body in charging area’ (or words to that effect) appeared periodically on the display and when I arrived I found that the phone had not been charged at all.Any ideas where I’m going wrong?","September 1, 2021"

wictod,"Others may chip in but I wouldn't hook a battery charger up then disconnect the battery.. in my uneducated opinion, with all the IBS systems and other ECUs / CPUs you've more chance of it throwing up errors doing it that way. I have disconnected the battery from the detachable earth connector a couple of times for various reasons and haven't had any problems. Some warning lights have come up afterwards but they soon clear after a number of ignition start cycles.

Deman77,Is there a something in settings to swivel the lights the correct way or you had to mess around with the lens stickers?i think I saw the metric switch somewhere so doubt kph display will be a problem.Was there any recent change for what you need in the car for France?

Isotope,"Good question I had to use a sticker on the Giulia last year, there doesn't seem to be any mention of changing the headlight aim for abroad, the Giulietta had a lever in the headlight that flattened the beam so it didn't dazzle and I always used that when I went to europe. Is there anything like that in a Stelvio?","August 22, 2021"
alfaitalia,That's one feature I liked about the older BMWs....there was a lever on the headlight that didn't just flatten the beam (removing the raised part that lights the side of the road over here but blinds oncoming drivers where they drive on the wrong side of the road!!)_....but completely reversed the tilted bit so the lights where every bit as good on the left or right side of the road! Cant believe more car makers didn't copy that....much better than using the silly stickers!,"August 23, 2021"
Deman77,My 2016 Volvo just had a lhd option in lights menu. You flick that and temporary kph display without changing other units as you roll off the train in Calais and the car is lhd ready. But that had fancy led that would self level and do all kinds of clever things like looking round corners and not blinding oncoming traffic whilst keeping high beam on. Yet I was hoping something simple like that would not be beyond Alfa. I guess they spent their effort elsewhere like making a decent driving cat and this is rare enough inconvenience. Stickers are in the post.,"August 23, 2021"

Harvo,The sealant or tyre weld are going to do the same job and neither would have helped you in your situation as they only work for hole punctures on the contact surface of a tyre.Or put another way..... I think you were unlucky with the type and position of your puncture.,"August 15, 2021"
GVblue,"I know all that thanks, but I now have to replace the used sealant and I am just asking for views on whether to replace with the same or trust in a couple of pressurised cans instead, which should at least inflate the tyre much more quickly.It's been interesting reading all of the posts, well most of them anyway, but does any have any views, or better still, experience on goo versus pressurised goo.","August 15, 2021"
GVblue,"Deman77 said:space saver spare is under 50mph max in straight line in the dry and you have to corner at very slow speeds especially in an suv. Your trip is almost certainly ruined and you have to go home and order a new tyre and wait for days to be back up and running. Car would be barely functional in the meantime. So all it does is saves you waiting for a tow.On non-qv where wheels are the same and if you don’t change to winters I would just buy a fifth wheel and rotate it through regularly (2k or so) to keep even wear on all 5. If you get a puncture you get a tow home (waiting in the rain under an umbrella or changing a wheel in the rain is about the same pain) and replace to the fifth one and order a new one. You are back on the road fully functional immediately and all your tyre are similar wear levels. When the new one arrives you rotate it in onto the corner that wears fastest and keep it in rotation until thread equalises with others.Gunk only works on thread puncture and not on tyre wall (tyre wall is always new tyre). If you do use it there is no repairing the tyre even if it does work. So that would be my last option. I would get a tow in first instance and try to see if tyre can get fixed.Click to expand...(""Get a tow"", a bit tricky with an all wheel drive automatic. Don't use the gunk. You can only do 50 mph with a space-saver.) - I think you may have just made the case for a space-saver wheel, one of which I would be delighted to have but I don't see how that would work as an after market option, but I haven't really investigated that option yet..","August 15, 2021"
Deman77,Lol. I guess I did.I don’t think this is the first awd auto they would be recovering so I wouldn’t worry.I would worry driving on a space saver though and I would only do it if you can get an Alfa own because you lay invalidate your insurance with anything else.I also would not like to have mismatched wear wheels on the car.,"August 15, 2021"

Deman77,"Don’t think anyone does space savers for high performance cars. You need to specifically develop, test and approve smth that can cope with staggered set up, high torque and weight. You then need to sell enough to recoup the development cost. You start with the few cars sold of which very few would want to pay extra and accept the extra weight penalty of wheel and Jack all the time to avoid recovery once in a blue moon.i carry electric pump in mine in case I get a screw or a nail with a slow puncture - the most common kind.

No reason a well maintained car with a full history, where they have replaced parts as they wear, should drive any different to new.Click to expand...Hence the reason for considering a low mileage heavily discounted demonstrator/ staff car/ loan car.

cue2,"My first Alfa was a 147 Q2 after I test drove a new Ducati Corse and thought I‘d prefer one without the stripes and 18” diamond cut wheels. I discovered there’d been a version before with just that spec ; 17” alloys and no stripes. I bought a demo of that model. Perfect , then I was refuelling and noticed a mask line on a paint repair. I always wonder why anybody sells a car that soon. Obviously this was a “demo” but how many people drove it and how much damage had been done?","August 13, 2021"

If I can’t afford it for cash I adjust my appetite. I can’t get my head around paying interest on top of depreciation.

Deman77,Don’t think I came across it in mine. But it’s academic - no car sat nav will come close to google maps or Waze.

jwq,"It's actually a missed opportunity by Alfa. The navigation part of the infotainment is actually from TomTom and TomTom was one of the first to use the wireless info from other TomTom units via inbuilt mobile for realtime traffic info.Alfa however did not implement this. Of course initially the giulia/stelvio did not have wireless connectivity, however, they could have used connected mobiles, as TomTom does in some of their stand-alone units. However, Alfa opted for the lesser system using RDS-TMC, which works, but gives less info.","July 27, 2021"
jwq,"afaik, it uses best guess. With loss of GPS It just uses avarage speed and direction over last period to predict where the car currently is.... It goes wrong if f.i. there's a turn-off in the tunnel, or a sharp corner. Granted doesn't happen very often","July 27, 2021"
Deman77,Fair enough. For me to get real quality of routing I go to calimoto but they are not on carplay yet. I find the gui is good enough in just about any nav solution but the real differentiation is traffic info quality and accuracy of ETA. I don’t see how anyone can compete with google/Waze there (it updates in real time - I saw my wait time in long temp traffic light queue changing as I was waiting as it must have been releasing cars in front and calculating when I will pass it).

niegowic,"kgb said:A little guide of how to install it:DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.Well first you need the steering wheel buttons with ACC button EPER part number is: 156130459also you need to have the front radar and camera, the procedure is the same for the Giulia0. If you don't want to remove the battery power it is best to leave your key away from the car so it doesn't go into standby mode. Also if you car has SGW you will need a few additional steps.1. You need to remove your steering wheel airbag. There is a clip accessible from the bottom of the airbag with a flat screw driver..you press it with the screw driver and then the airbag should come off. They are cables attached to the airbag so be careful and you also should remove them.2. Disconnect all cables.3. Remove steering wheel from the car, will be much easier to work this way. Then unscrew the 3 screws on the back...one behind each buttons panel and one in the bottom of the steering wheel. Then working on the bottom part of the steering wheel you need to detach the plastic cover that looks like aluminum using a a plastic screw driver for clips or something similar BUT becareful not to damage the leather on the steering wheel. They are two big plastic clips almost in the middle of the steering wheel located below the airbag. Carefully detach them.4. Once you have the plastic cover removed you can remove the buttons. Maybe it is a good idea to install the red start stop button if you want, at this time. Buttons have their own wiring so be careful with that as well. Take your time and don't rush ,it is not a very hard job.5. Replace buttons with the new ones. Then put everything back together.6. Connect Multiecuscan to your ABS and check that you have your steering wheel at 0.00degrees7. Turn on the car without starting the engine, connect Multiecuscan (MES) and go to Proxi alignment.8. In the part where you see that you have the cruise control enabled...disable it. Go to to adaptive cruise control and enable it.9. Do the proxi alignment. It is best to use Wifi Cantier interface (meaning latest version of the interface that has both wifi and BT) with MES as ELM327 or other interfaces might fail at some modules.10. When the proxi alignment finishes you will have error codes in some ECUs and you need adaptation of the ABS ecu. At this point the car is in safety mode and you won't be able to move it!!! Don't freak out. BUT for just in case everything goes to ****, park the car somewhere where it can stay until the tow truck comes.11. Go to ABS ecu and go to parameters. Check that steering wheel is at 0.00 degress meaning 100% in the center not turn left or right...then go to adjustments and do steering wheel reset.12. After that do a brake pressure reset.13. Also do YAW sensors reset.14. Delete DTCs erros in the ABS unit15. Switch off the car and wait a few mins.16. Turn on the car again and go to engine ecu delete DTCs there as well. After the proxi alignment is finished you will have erros in many ecus. (your engine might start to shake a little....don't freak outin most cases it doesn't. Thing is that engine is loosing connection to ABS unit, to say it short and some other stuff.17. After deleting dtc in engine ecu go to all other ecu and delete errors as well.18. Switch off the car and wait.19. Turn on the car press the cruise control and acc buttons and look at the display to see if the icons do appear.20. Find a nice road and with a friend of front of you try the ACC and learn how it works... also read the owners manual before that.21. Always look at the road ahead and be prepared to brake.22.

Deman77,I’ll rephrAse - Significantly less ugly than other SUVs. I found loading heavy stuff into higher SUV floor to be easier than with an estate where you have to be more bent over whilst holding heavy items. So not easier. Better dynamics and ride quality are the advantages of an estate. With all the same 4wd and equipment there will be no weight saving just lower down. You would still have no wading capability which means higher chance of hydrolocked engines especially with heavy turbocharging. I get regular flash floods around here - suv is not totally useless.,"May 18, 2021"
Deman77,I think they give harsher ride which is weird seeing as part of the reason Suv has harsher ride than an estate is because it has to stabilise weight higher up.as unsporty as it may feel that high driving position definitely makes the car more usable for non-track spirited driving as you get to see a lot more road imperfections well in advance.,"May 18, 2021"

The ESC system uses the rear brake calipers for what you could call as a cheap pseudo differential, perhaps it is over using the brakes wrongly but either way you should feel something off when driving due to simple fact that friction causes you to slow down or affects braking. They need to investigate what causes it. It could still be a slightly sticky parking brake which also uses the rear caliper in the standard Giulia and Stelvio. Only the Quadrifoglio models have a separate parking brake caliper.

alfaboeing,The loom is unique to the car depending on what options are installed apparently. The supplier whom provides this to the factory has to make one and then be coded to the vehicle and body computers etc. What is concerning is the engine out to install this as it will then not be like coming from the factory.

I was 100% set on a Mercedes GLC but after a deal broke down I've decided to take my time and explore more options.And that brings me to the Stelvio. In pictures I really like them and I think they are now my number 1 choice, but rightly or wrongly I do see it as a big risk.I'm worried about reliability and re-sale values. I'd be buying second hand, something between 23 to 26k, probably the fastest diesel.Are there any glaring things about the Stelvio I need to know. E.g. for the Merc GLC there is the wheel crabbing issue. Is there anything like that?Also, I'm used to VAG dealers, but what kind of discount should I be looking at on a 23k used stelvio, are they well known for giving big discounts?Any help appreciated.","April 27, 2021"

Alfie155,"You're not wrong there. If I'd known the depreciation hit after 18 months of ownership, would I have still proceeded?Who knows but I decided to stick with my MY19 Milano after the pcp or whatever it was ended as it was a known quantity and a MY20 would have cost an eye watering amount for no more than an improved infotainment system and maybe a different colour scheme.So to answer the OPs question don't get a Speciale or Super - get a Milano.

At one point I couldn't even get the car backed up on my drive and it's just a lowered kerb, so an incline of about 4 inches. I'm looking at a Stelvio and wonder how you guys find the Q4 system? My problem is I am very old and back in the day all my cars were RWD, so I thought I was a pretty good adopter of them hence the Giulia, 30 years later after every car being FWD I'm in an RWD car and I can't believe how much more confident a FWD car feels, I love smashing down the ridge in the road and even overtaking other cars in the snow in an FWD car. Does the Stelvio Q4 system inspire that sort of confidence? I would be very interested in anyone that may have had a similar experience, maybe going from FWD to Q4 without the RWD experience?","February 21, 2021"

cue2,Going down hill is going to be difficult without the ability to regain control of the cars direction. The same with braking as the Q4 is only of use when power is being put down.The Stelvio is still way lighter than a Porsche Macan or Caynine. The Cayenne Coupe weighs 25% more than a Stelvio Quadrifoglio.,"February 21, 2021"
Isotope,"Deman77 said:From what you described you should just be getting a set of winter tyres.q4 will only give you better traction on the limit and only where it comes to power application (not with braking). Winter tyre will extend that limit very significantly.another consideration with Stelvio is what you are compromising by going with Stelvio. Firmer springs to control heavier car that is also sat higher means less flowing and more fidgety ride. More body movement too. Heavier car means lower power to weight ratio on same engine so 90% of times where you do not struggle for grip it will accelerate slower. Heavier car can carry less speed through the corner when they are both balanced (q4 will only be faster where you are powering through on limit of grip which is either very aggressive or more often you are not cornering correctly). Heavier car wears tyres, brakes, suspension more ands stops slower.I’d say for qv it is worth it to extend car usability into winter as 500 on rear axle with 1.5 ton giulia you just won’t be able to enjoy it in the wet and cold unless you race cars for a living if you have fully developed frontal lobe and understand that on normal roads there are a lot of things outside your control so pushing limits is taking chances. For sub 300bhp power you will really need to try to provoke it for that power to be a problem. More often it is be too much speed into the corner which q4 will not help you with.Click to expand...Your quote about winter tyres is probably valid, just not a mindset I've considered having no issues with FWD cars for so long and the last couple of winters have been very mild in the UK and certainly cheaper than a new car!

Muz,"Deman77 said:Q you are rightfully confused.lots of people both here and on Stelvioforums talk about asking dealer for AGM without really appreciating what it is like from dealer perspective.They need to fall over themselves to convince Alfa to allow them to install non-OEM part.By default Alfa will not compensate them for AGM battery upgrade as they have not even switched to those on recent model years. So dealer has to be so keen to make the customer happy that they would fall over themselves to make arrangements with Alfa for battery replacement or pay for it themselves - not the difference - the whole thing. The flip side is they need to make no extra effort just put the new battery in and get paid for the job. Plus if it breaks under warranty again, they will get paid again.The only thing they may consent to is installing customer own battery (not a given) but I have a feeling they will also be warning of possible warranty issues in case future issues are attributed to non-OEM battery. I think that risk is low so I would still try it and at least get the install on them and pay for the battery out of my own pocket.Click to expand...I have been amazed over the last two years to be told by the garage I have used for 15 years, and a couple of others too when I checked, that they cannot fit parts supplied by me anymore. Something to do with insurance and them becoming liable for any failing parts that you supplied for them to fit. Take it to the Nth degree and an Alfa dealer could potentially (and almost certainly would) refuse to fit a battery you supplied.","February 14, 2021"

While I was there I enquired into getting them to fit a full set of new brakes on my GT86 (front/rear pads and disks, currently sat in my garage).

j20eyk,"Evening AllAfter a short a time in a Macan GTS it looks like I am coming back to Alfa. 12 months ago sold my Giulia Quad due to my first child arriving, wanted something sporty for when I was on my own but a little more practical for the new family. Ordered a GTS, (I did debate on a Stelvio at the time) waited six months for it. Just a nice car, feels solid, etc etc all the german cliché talk. Just a car really. I absolutely loved my Giulia and maybe I expected too much from the GTS but it just did not come close. I never felt like I wanted to drive it just for the sake of it, didn't look at it in admiration, didn't have the noise or sense of occasion when I got in it. Sold the GTS today and the bonus is, it cost me all of about 2k to have it for 6 months. Not many cars you could say that about!So a Stelvio is on the cards. I don't see what else will come close to the Giulia and I know the Stelvio isn't a Giulia but it's the closest I can get at the minute with the young one. In the future maybe back to a GiuliaThink I am going to buy used this time to ensure I like it first and see how it goes.","January 21, 2021"
cue2,Congratulations on the Stelvio.You’re probably right that the questions are for the dealer to answer. It’s a used car...Ive had a Speciale for two years now from new and luckily it doesn’t have the keyless nonsense that causes new cars to have krooklocks!,"January 15, 2021"
Maximus84,Thanks Cue.Loved the Giulia when I had it but a move back to the UK meant I had to get rid and with the family the Stelvio seemed a logical choice! Every car I've had for the last 5 years or so (including the G) has had keyless entry and I actually find it really useful - even my 8yr old Toyota GT86 has it. So a little disappointing the Stelvio doesn't. Still great car and has lots of other good features!I am really unimpressed with this dealership so far and will await there answers but I'm not confident in them. It's actually a Lexus Main Dealer so I would expect better...,"January 15, 2021"

jwq,"But that would, if true, apply to any size battery, including the smaller one...... You would still end up with higher capacity with bigger batteryRegardless, it also depends on the algorithms the IBS uses to determine battery capacity....","December 30, 2020"
Andy Bowden,"If the battery capacity does indeed reduce over time due to the charging logic and the IBS learns the battery's effective capacity, there would be a never ending spiral of battery capacity reduction.ie IBS initially maintains the battery at 75% of 80Ah, battery thinks it is a 60Ah battery, IBS charges battery to 75% of 60Ah ad infinitum.I remain sceptical.","December 30, 2020"
jwq,"I also still have my original battery from august 2017, without problems......I do cheat by regularly using a charger though, specially these days where I don't drive much....","December 30, 2020"
jwq,"re generator, it's not a massive difference. I agree it's mostly to compensate for the higher current drain in cold countries due to heated accessories.......battery specs:• 12v 80AH 680A - non cold countries• 12v 95AH 800A - cold countriesalternator 150 vs 180 amps, see :","December 30, 2020"
Top Down,"Andy Bowden said:My understanding of the IBS is that it will initially establish the SoC of a new battery by reference to the standard theoretical curve of SoC v Voltage which is independent of battery capacity.Then over time it will integrate the current in and out of the battery over time to update its SoC estimate. Though I would expect it will compare Voltage with the standard curve at times of nil or low battery current to ensure its SoC estimate is not wildly out.i don't believe that the IBS or BCM need to know the battery capacity or that they would be affected by fitment of a higher capacity battery.Nor do I see any problems fitting a 95Ah battery to a car with an alternator originally associated with an 80Ah battery. I'd see AR's decision to fit a higher capacity alternator as part of the winter pack being based on greater current demand for heated rear window and seats etc in cold climates and unrelated to battery size.I do have a degree in electrical engineering.Click to expand...Andy, if the IBS was that clever, why do we have any battery that is not fully charged?

jwq,"I doubt the IBS is the problem, I would sooner question the charging logic that is implemented in the bodycomputer for one, using the values passed on by the IBS.The IBS does not control anything, it just measures.","December 30, 2020"

Seems if the cars have been standing unused without a CTEK or equivalent this is quite a common problem.It also appears that unsold cars that have stood for months are affected, so even brand new (in theory) cars are equally at risk.Mine was a demonstrator registered in Jan 20 and came with 6500 miles on the clock so hopefully I am not going to get this problem as the colder nights draw in.

epsonix,"OK, I won't be arguing. If you have it working on your phone in other cars, but not in Alfa due to lack of agreement between FCA and Google, then I guess that they blocked it in proxi configuration, and so possibly it coudl be activated by change in proxi using 3rd party tools/SGW bypass etc. I did activated AA/ACP in cars without such from factory, but with new type of infotainment. Firmware is one, common for all markets Giulia&Stelvio. Do you have means of reading proxi configuration (best for me MES software)?","November 14, 2020"

Mpetrou,"kgb said:For those of you who want to install the dual USB hub needed for the activation of Android Auto/Apple Carplay1. Check the software version of your ETM (aka the Nav system) to be at least 056 and up. 056 is update for older Nav systems up to 2018... usually the MY2018 start with 059. I have somewhere the 056 software so if someone needs it, send me a pm so I can upload it somewhere.2. Install the new dual usb hub. EPER part number 0156143958 for the USA market it is a different number if I am not mistaken.3. Well you have to dismantle your center tunnel (arm rest)...4. Move both front seats at maximum front position5. Seat in back seat and pull away carefully the plastic around the rear air vents.6. Using your tools unscrew the 3 bolts that hold the arm rest on the top of the glove box. (see the pic)7. Now unscrew the 4 bolts that hold the air tubes going to the rear air vents as you need to move them a little in order to get your hand in the tight place under the glove box. (see the pic)8. Now with the arm rest removed you need to go to the front seat and pull the plastic cover around the center glove box on which you have also the parking brake button. So be careful not to pull like crazy and snap the cable for the P brake. Pull from the front near P brake button, as in the rear you will see that they are no clips...DO NOT pull from the back as you will brake the cover. You have to do it from the front and then remove the connection for the P brake and then carefully remove slide it from the back... Look at the back and you will see.9. Now carefully disconnect the led light for the glove box...don't look for a bulb type, use a fine flat screw driver and remove it from the box.10. Remove the air tube to the box11. Get your special tool as you need to get it below the box in the center of the box. USE fine gloves to protect your hands as you might scratch them... First blood to your Stelvio can happen here and hopefully the only.12. Undo the two ""bolts"" that are in the center of the bottom in the box...no the two middle ones as they hold the antenna for keyless go. (see few pics)13. Take your time or use someone with smaller hands...it is very tight there...push down the rear air vent tubes to get more space.14. Once you manage to remove the two screws...go have a drink and feel like a winner...you can skip that part15. Pull from the top...the box is now being hold by 4 clips...into the four corners...you will be able to see them...but careful with the plastic box.16. Now you see the cables for the USB hub...disconnect them.17. Change the single USB with the double one...check if it works for charging18. Put everything back together19. At this point you will be thinking of not putting the two screws under the box...BUT do them20. When everything is put together you need to go to someone having the factory diagnostics called Witech. Basically you might need to go to the dealer (good to talk to them before as they might refuse to do the job for unknown reason). Hopefully soon MES or ALFAOBD will be able to active the AA/Carplay The time needed for the dealer is like 10mins.21. So while at the dealer connect Witech go to ETM menu and in misc. tab there is a function called Android Auto/Carplay offline activation. Press it after about 10sec it will say complete.22. Shut down the car and take away the key as the car needs to get into standby mode...the ETM needs to reboot.23. Turn your Stelvio and connect your Android or Iphone...for Android you need to have Android Auto installed on your phone!!! Connected your phone via BT and also via GOOD USB cable. bad USB cable will prevent it from working...price of the cable has nothing to do with the quality. I bought 10 euro cable and it doesn't work... a 2 euro cable works perfectly. BEST is to use original cable.24. You can check if Android Auto was activated without connecting it to a phone by going in the option menu in your ETM...press option and scroll down till you see Android Auto, it is the last one25.

On the passenger side it is much neater and covers the metal frame. I have attached a photo. The photo was taken from above looking into the window cavity.I did an experiment yesterday where I stuck a generous strip of general purpose window insulation around that area. Granted the strip is much thicker, it did seemingly cure that sensation of open window noise. When I removed the strip, the noise was back.I am wondering if this is something I can get Alfa to replace. The car is still under warranty.On a side note, is it normal that the door trim pulls off so easily? I mean I didn't need any tools or any excessive force.

punkatron1,"Deman77 said:Corsas? I thought those were on Giulia. Stelvio should be on plain p zero. That’s the stock with Alfa codes.Speaking from research - no personal experience - still waiting for build date for mine. Mine will get switched straight into winters but I am considering switching summers as well if road noise is too much.The top alternative (lower noise and better ride and probably better handling) is Michelin Pilot sport 4s - you can get an SUV version with harder tyre walls if you are worried about punctures and failure but you will pay with ride quality. Stelvio is not as heavy your typical suv more like a heavy estate - 540 touring and tyre rating is same as for estates so standard one should be fine - load ratings match the homologated Pirellis. You can get Porsche (taycan) homologated rear ps4s to get exact size and fronts are generic - our size is available. Now taycan is way heavier so I think it should be fine.Click to expand...Thanks for that. I was thinking PS4s but will only swap if they’re a bit more robust. I get it’s a performance tyre, but replacing 3 tyres in 9 months is annoying.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk","September 12, 2020"
Deman77,go for SUV with higher load ratings stiffer side walls then. You could go for contis - they are bulletproof but they are mega noisy.have you considered that you perhaps had unlucky streak or you happen to drive through some high puncture risk areas (farmyards some heavy machinery yards)It’s unusual to blame tyres on punctures. If you stick a nail in I do not think a tyre will matter - same with cut sidewall.Sidewall failure in a pothole is a different matter.how come they were not repairable after punctures?,"September 12, 2020"
punkatron1,One was an M8 bolt so too big to plug. It was bizarre to be be honest. Another plugged but it was questionable if it could be fixed so played it safe.

Alarm screaming, headlights flashing, wipers wiping, doors locking and unlocking and the rest.No real panic as I had the same with my Giulia six months ago, just a question of stopping it by opening the boot and disconnecting the battery.Except, the electric tailgate would not open so I had the fun of climbing over the back seats to release the tailgate manually, whilst wearing nothing more than a bathrobe.Fortunately, none of the neighbours took a blind bit of notice of the alarm so were spared such an horrific sight.Awaiting Alfa Assist.","August 18, 2020"

Alfie155,"Trundling back from Sussex yesterday on the M23 (on the damned 50 Average Speed section) I wondered why everyone was being so law-abiding, ie on cruise control set to 50 I was gliding by many cars. With a stab of fear it occured that maybe the speedo was drastically under-reading so got the passenger to open my gps-based speedo app on my phone.Assuming that is accurate (you have to have some sort of benchmark!) I was surprised to see the Stelvio speedo is almost spot on. Later on, at indicated speeds of 50, 60 and 70 on the Alfa's digital screen, the phone app reading was just 1mph less in every case.I'm sure that in years gone by it was generally assumed the speedos were over-reading by at least 3/4mph particularly at higher speeds.","August 17, 2020"
SteveeGee,"By law your Speedo isn’t allowed to under read. Most over read and the margin was higher as it was a simplistic sometimes mechanical solution but as electronics have improved it has gotten ever more accurate, with the ECU’s accounting for different sized wheels etc now on cars. Usually accurate to within 2-5mph. The stelvio is very accurate I’ve noticed that too.","August 17, 2020"

stelvio2018stoon,"Hey guys,I have at 2018 Stelvio Ti, just hit 10,000km. Recently I noticed that after leaving the vehicle turned off (after letting properly cool down in driveway after driving), the vehicle begins making sounds. From the outside, it sounds like a faint beeping sound under the hood. Upon opening the hood, it sounds more like a valve releasing or grinding sound. It occurs at irregular intervals every 5ish seconds, and lasts approx 1 second, sometimes longer. It sounds like it is coming from the upper driver side of the engine block. The sound will persist for up to an hour or so after driving, sometimes longer.My local Alfa service team is trying to also determine the cause as I sent them the video. They recommended I try locking the doors to see if it stops the sound, which it does not.Anyone have any ideas?","August 9, 2020"

If you want to go up the absolute highest paved road in the Alps, slightly higher than the Stelvio look up the Col d'liseran 2770 metres.

Guess depends on what you class as low APR - I can find a dellivery mileage Quad MY20, with 12k off list which would also attract new finance support, currently 3.8% on the Alfa website, depending on how desperate the dealer is to sell, might be able to swing a bigger discount or slight APR drop.","July 14, 2020"

Alfie155,I note a lot of owners are using CTEK conditioner/chargers.Trouble is I don't have a garage - well I do but no way a Stelvio will fit - so how do you connect a charger to the battery when the doors/boot lid will trap the lead? The best I could do is feed the extension lead through a back window and close it as far as possible.Anyone here tried that method?,"June 11, 2020"
Martini Racing,"Yes ,that's how I connect the charger through the rear window,although garaged the seal looked good and shower proof and cable was not pinched, but I used the ctek extension lead to get through the window seal,which is thinner than power cable and for outside weatherproofing the ctek could be put in a waterproof cable box.","June 11, 2020"

There’s a risk , if you don’t heat the surface to get a better keying the paint will fall off Stelvio parts too. You can get filler primer to fill the grain if the 2020 parts are just painted.

You know, if it fails (and I know one case it started showing excessive oil level during ride, but after draining all to container QTY was correct, so sensor was replaced), then you base your decisions on wrong level.There is small slot on 2.0 engines for service bayonet, but access is not great as far as one guy who looked at it confirmed. You need also this special bayonet.I try to increase confidence to reading by making sure with dealer serviceman how much oil he put in (5.2L), then rechecking with MES what it displays and with more or less observing the level displayed on ignition on (not too often, just every a few weeks), I have a clue that readins make still sense. I loose a lot of oil (driving short distances and have heavy foot on gas pedal), so I expect that over my oil change interval (I half the recommended due to driving style and distances, in practice change every half year/every 7.5kkm) I loose say 30% of max-min range.

Jetronic77,"It's been a few months so I guess you found out already. This is for the next guy then.Engine wise 3000 pounds is nothing, the smallest engine can do that.

However when I am in Dynamic mode and the revs get to about 3500 the speaker sounds like its going to blow and is very rattily and distorted which rather spoils the engine sound.Has anyone else had this issue and if so any suggestions on a fix?Car is a Petrol 280ThanksSteve,"April 16, 2020"

No other symptoms.It’s 2018 2.0 280hp but just bought it last month from the dealer and got only around 1300km (around 800miles).Any ideas? Is that normal or should I be alarmed?Regards","April 15, 2020"

Bobbybear,Hinot quite sure what your rattling sound is but I had a screeching/rattling sound coming through my centre speaker for ages last year every time I accelerated .

It was replaced last August but started again in January so had it completely disconnected at service. sound Completely gone Now and don’t really miss the piped engine coming through.,"April 15, 2020"

I have told the garage I'm going to drive a couple of hundred miles over the 17000 before I visit and the receptionist said it's ok blah blah..Question is: Are the warnings just warnings or is there some enforced shutdown of the systems if I ignore it?

My first time written instructions on Giulia forum may not be super optimal, yesterday's GIulia upgrade I did it bit different way (e.g. panel on dash I removed normally without trouble - can't say for sure, maybe it is car dependant how tight it sits). I'm not removing passenger side vent, only its outer cover. Also now removing the cover is 30sec, first time I spend 30 minutes just on this, and futher 30minutes to remove vent itself (and I gave up)","January 24, 2020"
Shockvalue,Well it looks like the dealer will replace the infotainment screen. Could anyone who have had this done by the dealer let me know what parts of the dash had to be disassembled?.

It appears that nobody was near the vehicle so it's a false alarm but all the system did was flash all the lights because I didn't hear any sirens or whatever from inside the house, switching to one of my other cameras with audio I could hear what sounded like the extended bleep when you disarm the vehicle only.. is this how the alarm works and sounds or is this a known quirk?cheers","February 23, 2020"

wictod,"Yeah defo, I think I was reading some of your contribution jwq on the long Giulia thread about the issue.. I switched it off before I primed the alarm on the last occasion it went off so that rules out the tilt sensor I guess.. on that long thread they mention water or moisture shorting out some sensor under the bonnet.. alarm only appears to go off when the car gets mist and dew on it at night so could be something like that?","December 31, 2019"

Diabolik19701,Looking to buy a Stelvio soon but am in 2 minds to whether to get the 280 hp petrol .. is it worth the extra outlay compared to the lower powered engines.. ?,"February 10, 2020"
cue2,I’ve read in tests that the lower powered petrol engines are lacking torque.,"February 6, 2020"
SteveeGee,"Only you can decide after a test drive. I’m using a Guilia diesel whilst my Stelvio is in for its service, only 180hp version but if they hadn’t said, I wouldn’t know.Drive the lower powered one first though....","February 6, 2020"
cue2,"I drove a Giulia 180 diesel for a couple of days and at 23000 it seemed quite good. Being closer to the ground probably made it feel faster than in a Stelvio. A petrol of the same horsepower and lower torque might not work so well. Also, the lack of flappy paddles made driving a bit more ponderous.","February 6, 2020"
Tidmarm,"Don’t discount the 210 diesel if you are doing the miles, I’ve driven both and have to admit the diesel engine suits the Stelvio better, it feels more planted with all that torque on offer.The 280 petrol was good but not sure its worth the extra fuel cost, it also felt more skittish. The lack of torque on the 200 petrol might not be enough to give you what you need out and about on the road.I suppose you need to consider if your going to keep it for a while or not, any trade in on a diesel might be painful ?","February 7, 2020"
cue2,"I’d recommend the 210, with the trade-in proviso , as it suits the Stelvio. Sitting a bit higher makes the character more suitable than in a Giulia I found. Tons of torque and a great auto box make the 210 Stelvio good to drive.","February 7, 2020"

Diabolik19701,Cheers for the comments. At this point I'm waiting for the quoting system to load the my20. Though I was kindly provided with a pricing list with standard equipment detailed. The Sprint is so comprehensively loaded that all id add to it would be the paddles and wireless charging. .. but engine wise that would mean the 190 diesel or the 200 petrol .. For the 210 diesel and 280 id need to get the veloce but thats another 4k on top of the Sprint base price but then you get also the dynamic suspension and forementioned options and a bunch of other stuff... choices choices as they say ?,"February 7, 2020"
cue2,The Sprint name sounds quite “junior” but it looks like the Speciale equivalent? But no 210 engine.,"February 7, 2020"

markiet,"i do love my 280 Milano, but even driving normally in ""green"" mode it still only does 25 mpg in running around locally (5-10 mile trips).I stayed away from the diesels when I bought mine, given the government's ever increasing taxation on deisels.

I've got the 280 Specialie .. been paying attention to the mileage over the last few months, although mine is 280 it should give you some idea. Around town I'm getting around 25mpg average.. a mix of round town and some long stretches i'm getting about 30mpg but I am using the cruise control on long stretches where we have these average speed limits zones.. I done a long 500 mile round trip on our motorways and managed to get 35mpg but I was using cruise control again on long stretches of controlled speed limit..

Kannassee,"Tjalle said:I struck GOLD or ""Pay Dirt"", as they say in the gold fields.I, finally, found an in-detail description of Alfa Torque Vectoring - at Giulia threads - page 3 (4 weeks ago) - no 6 - ""Elektro hydraulic braking""- ""quad trainingmanual.pdf"".Short:-operates only on rear wheels-includes fully controllable clutches left/right.-includes lh/rh planetary gears-can send 0-100% torque to either wheel.-controlled by Integrated Chassis Control, which monitors; steering angel, yaw velocity, X/Y acceleration and vehicle speed.One of situations described is accelerating out of a turn, where torque is directed to outer wheel, which is consistent with ""lead footed"" journalists hanging out rear end when exciting curve on a track.I forgot: there is also an in-depth description of the engine and all its systems/details: I would never own a QF without proper warranty or insurance!!Click to expand...Lol....I agree with you 100 percent!!!.....here in the US Alfa has a bad reputation regarding mech breakdowns so an extended warranty is almost a MUST!!!....just joking....by the way the extended warranty costs almost half as the Porsche’s one","August 27, 2018"
Tjalle,"Kannassee, I take it you have a Stelvio QF: I saw in an US evaluation, that in RACE, they got the higher (nice) sound ""all the way"", which in Europe- very likely - would not pass exterior sound test.

Tilum,"I'm not sure about LHD Euro variants, but the RHD variants (e.g. for the UK market) that I saw/drove at Goodwood had the sports exhaust 'active' throughout the rev range. I'm pretty sure it's the same for LHD U.S. variants (looking at YouTube videos). I'd be surprised if it's restricted to 3.5k rpm and above only though - my Maserati GranCabrio MC's sports exhaust is always 'active' throughout the rev range when 'Sport' mode is selected. Some variants of the GranTurismo and GranCabrio have the sports exhaust 'deactivated' below 3.5k rpm to avoid a monotone droning sound when cruising at low revs.","August 27, 2018"
Tjalle,"I only have dealer telling me about ""3500 rpm"" limit, but at the same time, I have a hard time believing that vehicle with open valves can pass EU exterior noise test.Whatever - time will tell.I have a - supposedly - M Performance exhaust system - but in reality developed and manufactured by Red Arch Manufacturing in the UK. It has two modes - operated by remote control: Sport and Track. Operates two valves. Track is not legal for road use and I doubt that system, with a possibility for illegal soundlevel, is at all legal.","August 27, 2018"
Tjalle,"Kannassee, blurbs/sparks you hear in RACE, is an elaborate tuning of engine in RACE mode in order to obtain just that. It is, supposedly, a sign of a high performance engine.Yes, you will have increased power. Whether it is 1 hp or 20 is hard to tell.Enjoy!","August 27, 2018"
Tilum,"Kannassee said:I think as soon as you select RACE, the exhaust sounds changes, at least in the model that they sell here in the US.Maybe with the louder noise the engine would gain some extra HP, assuming that the exhaust is more open?I have not pushed the ""baby"" hard since its only 2 weeks old, less than 1600 km, I did it only once, I set it to RACE and I floored it for 2 secs......and WOW....what a beast.....I think the the noise is impressive but there are different types of sounds, (it sounded to me like misfires? although I hope that was not the case)....I don't know how they do it....I have never been a fan of those loud sounds but it was ok, at least impressive....could you say in English....badass sound??....lolClick to expand...Hi Kannassee, I was indeed referring to RACE mode (when the sports exhaust is 'active' throughout the entire rev range (0-6700 rpm).

Tilum,"Exactly as I thought (and previously stated). TBH I'd be surprised if there are any differences (regarding the sports exhaust activation set-up) between U.S. / U.K. / Euro specs.The exhaust sounds great, but it's not deafeningly loud, i.e. it's unlikely to exceed road regulatory requirements, even with the valves fully open!","August 29, 2018"

lizard,"Watched the presentation as well, BMW is claiming that it will be the new benchmark in driving dynamics, agility, etc..., however I highly doubt it will stand a chance against dynamic ability of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio, it will also be less powerful (it is estimated it will have around 450 bhp).

Tjalle,"I can agree to that. Most buyers will alsp look at: engine performance (M40i has 350 bhp), build quality, materials and expected life, where Stelvio has something to prove….When BMW claimed: ""we will set new standards on handling"", they - probably - meant: we will beat Macan.

Tjalle,"I will gladly share any experience, which I believe is worth wile:-I will not put any spacers - unless ""needed"". My ""gut feeling"" limit is 20 mm.-sorry, but your limited slip differential - although a good feature - is not near the Torque Vectoring System on QF, which consists of a devise integrated in rear axle, which has two planetary gears and two electronically operated clutches (0-100% torque). Controlled by an ICC system (Integrated Chassis Control)measuring: steering wheel angle, lateral acceleration, speed, rotational speed (yaw). Based on this, system sends - through clutches - more or less torque to either of rear wheels.","December 6, 2018"
hbv,"Your are absolutely right, the limited slip system of the QF is more sofisticated. This is the reason why I would stick to the original wheels (exception: you will get others with exactly the same measures). The Nürburgring Record was also done with the OE - but perhaps with other tires?","December 6, 2018"
Tjalle,"Torque Vectoring is not a limited slip design. My reading of the system is that equal spacers, will not cause havoc with system/handling. ""Just"" additional load on bearings.I believe record is supposed to be set with original tyres, but people has been cheating before, and I don´t think there is an organisation checking - only video as proof. I know one company, that for some time had the official endurance speed record in it`s class. Although there was an independent organisation checking, they got away with wrong tyre size - to reduce drag.","December 6, 2018"

It really helped with cornering. The MDX handled well but she did not liked it, at the end she bought a big XC90 Momentum with that big/little engine...turbo +supercharged.....what I did not find out is if the XC90 has some type of system like that, that would help with cornering??)....well I am getting out of topic I think","December 7, 2018"

As in winter most of the roads are clean I prefer the 20'' as they are far smoother to drive and better on the road than 19'' ore even worse 18''. In snow my experience is that 'N' might be the most adequate selection. The only disadvantage on my car is that you can not switch off the assistances as ESP and ASD. The consequence is that you can not slide / strong accelerate in narrow corners as the systems will slow down the car. Recommend that you arrange a demo car to try it out and to compare with your QF.

TI-ger boz,"Sadly I think it's all to do with fudging the emissions. An auto box can be tweaked to give good, consistent results. With a manual the results can be as random as the driver. I'm very disappointed with the gearbox options in the current range (no option), I bought a 1.4 Giulietta with manual box and this will probably stay with me until it, or I, fall to pieces.","January 22, 2020"
alfaitalia,Also or course we are one of the few nations in the world where manuals outsell autos so they tend to think of the global market rather than just one small country. They are also making an effort with the States...were manuals are very much a thing of the past. That's the reason you have not been able to buy a manual proper Range Rover for years....the US market …. Here we roughly sell about 80% manuals (slowly going down every year) compared to 20% auto....in most other major markets is roughly the other way around!!,"January 22, 2020"
cue2,"It’s down to emissions as mentioned, plus it’s a lot easier to package all the asymmetric bits of gearbox only LHD. The Giorgio cars come as manual or auto in LHD markets.The Giulietta is a good example of a compromised RHD pedal layout. The HVAC and gearbox tend to be a bit interwoven and LHD-centric and there’s a lot of stuff to position. The french cars where the master cylinder is left hand drive and the front passenger applies the brakes by pressing on the floor in front of them show a lot of the compromise. Obviously, the Stelvio and Giulia have a different braking system but this still takes up space.","January 22, 2020"
stelviowner,"I'm still smiling at the picture of the passenger in a French car being responsible for the braking. Mind you I have applied the brake as a passenger before, pressing on the carpet when the driver didn't seem to be on top of the situation. I can understand what you say about the interchangability of components being a pain between the driving sides but surely when you are making cars for a global market you factor this into your costings and design. If Alfa want to achieve world domination they need to offer what the customer wants rather than trying to convince the customer that they really would prefer the product on offer, however much it falls short of their aspirations.","January 22, 2020"
cue2,Manual gearboxes are so yesterday?!,"January 22, 2020"
PapaSmurf,Why don't you try using the Manual mode?,"January 22, 2020"
alfaitalia,Most manual cars still give better mpg than the auto equivalent....so if autos burn more fuel I doubt that overall they give out less emissions. I quickly looked at the mpg of a few poplar models with both transmissions....even the best autos were only equalling the manuals on fuel consumption...not beating them. Logic would say that any transmission slip such as you get in an auto in both the gears and the torque converter is waisted fuel?? Maybe I just looked at the wrong cars!,"January 22, 2020"
SteveeGee,"But the manufacturers get more consistent results with a computer controlled rather than human controlled transmission. Plus they can have more gears (8,9,10 speed) in autos to better suit and further tune efficiency and emissions at any speed point. The latest autos perform coast modes, or lockup torque converter to reduce slippage and further improve on losses. More consistently and with more sophistication than 99% of typical drivers.","January 22, 2020"
stelviowner,"SteveeGee said:I don’t get any gearbox hesitation in auto. If it is put in manual mode, stick left, then the car will hold a selected gear as you accelerate and will not change up, it will bounce off the Rev limiter. It will only change down in manual mode if you decrease speed so much it would stall, so it changes down to prevent it. if you leave it in auto mode and just grab a paddle to change up/down, then it will quickly revert and/or decide on its own. The software learns your driving style and adjusts the shift points and speed to blend economy or sportiness.Did you know if you pull the down paddle and hold it, it will change down, 1,2, or even 3 gears at once to the highest possible rev point to aide acceleration or engine braking.It’s an extremely sophisticated box the Zeppelin ZF8 and is used in virtually all premium manufacturers cars in a variety of different configurations.Manual cars are becoming a rarity and it’s all down to emissions control.Click to expand...Sounds as though I need to look at my auto box more thoroughly. Thanks for the tips. Still be a pain though working the car around the hairpin bends though. Too much brain dedicated to working out the gearbox whereas in a manual it all comes so much more naturally, the car becomes an extension of your thought process. The hesitation annoys me, half a heartbeat before the car reacts to the pedal, suprising how much can happen in that time.","January 22, 2020"

SteveeGee,"I agree - in Dynamic mode, I couldn't change gear with stick and clutch as quick as it bangs in the shifts in auto! One things i have found with my diesel model is that of the 8 gears, 1st is very short, not needed really, 2nd is easy to pull away on, 3rd follows close behind 2nd, bigger rev drop to 4th which isn't much different to 5th, bigger drop to 6th, then 7th is close and 8th is very overdriven. This makes choosing manually a more difficult job than a 5 or even 6 speed stick, as you have more to choose from and you typically need a higher gear than you thought.","January 25, 2020"
Hugh Myles,"You need to learn how to use the box properly. If it is kicking down a gear, or two, after you have selected a gear to accelerate out of a bend, then quite simply you have selected the wrong gear. If you select dynamic on the DNA controller for those occasions and leave it in Auto it will never put you in that situation as it selects the appropriate gear as you slow for the bend. Also, by pushing the accelerator pedal beyond the first stop you are activating the kickdown. The box is only following your inputs. Its not the problem, you are. Sorry to be blunt, but there you are.","January 25, 2020"
Andy Bowden,"I don't fully agree with that, at least as far as the Quadrifoglio is concerned. I often find that if the auto is left entirely to itself I'll enter the bend one or two gears higher than I'd like.Simple solution is a quick click or two of the left paddle.Though, always if I'm on a mountain road with hairpins, or on a windy country road and I'm looking to make good progress, I'll be in manual.I'm very rarely driving in anything other than D.","January 25, 2020"
stelviowner,"I'm with Andy Bowden here. I don't want to blast into the bends too fast or with a screaming engine, but I do want to be able to have the correct gear in place to power out of the bend. The auto box always seems to be a gear or two High if left to its own devices and has to change down for the exit. Also, being a time served manual box fan I find instinctively outwitting the auto box into my choice of gear tiresome and distracting. Foot down whilst in the bend, means gear changes down, turbolag clears, too much power in the bend. Getting it right is a definite knack.","January 26, 2020"

No, its just so easy to get it sent to your home, get it on the windscreen before you leave and thats one thing less to do and saving having to stop.","July 12, 2019"

I put about a third of a litre in and after a 30 minute run out checked the oil level and it was right on the upper mark so didn't need a lot in it.

The Stelvio has keyless entry and I want to mitigate the possibility of theft as much as practical.I have been told that a steering wheel lock is a good way to deter this happening as it adds extra hassle for any would be thief.What's the view on this and are there any recommendations as to which one.

cue2,I have a Stelvio Speciale in Monte Carlo Blue and Red Calipers but I didn’t order keyless locking. The original owner of the one you’re buying must have got it as an extra? A steering wheel lock and all the hassle and damage it’ll do to the steering wheel seems to outway any benefits for you but probably a good idea if you think it’ll be targeted. At £1300 or something like that for a headlight it does represent a valuable collection of spares I suppose.

I.e. no forward push - only braking. I seem to remember Audi using planetary gears on front axles, which might work - but I doubt as effectively as on Stelvio QF.Is your Giulia RWD or AWD? I seem to recollect AWD Giulias are not imported into UK.Click to expand...The RS6 has a proper version of torque vectoring in conjunction with the Sport Differential just like you describe for the Stelvio (but was introduced in 2013).My Giulia is RWD.

MikeFish,"Audi magnetic ride suspension was only ever used on the A3s, TTs and R8s. Good system and pretty reliable from my experience. However, I think you meant the DRC (Dynamic Ride Control) system as used on RS4s, RS6s and RS5s. This has had trouble from the outset in 2002 and Audi continued to use it even up to the latest RS6 although in a much more reliable state (and slightly less effective if you ask me). It is a great system though; the B7 RS4 cornered flatter than an other car I could think of yet had a comfortable ride that didn't shake your fillings out. Just a shame they couldn't nail the reliability. And it was very expensive to fix.","July 9, 2019"

Navlet,"It's always a shame when reality doesn't match the imagination but thus it ever was... Stelvio could have been something special but for me it's too plain and could easily be mistaken for many other SUV's on the market , its not different enough. My wife is partial to SUVs and was excited about an Alfa tractor but bought an Evoque instead common as muck but but better styling. Her words not mine but for once I find myself agreeing with her","February 8, 2019"
cue2,Did you drive a Stelvio?It's not equivalent to the Ewok. It's way better. Styling is a matter of taste but the LandRover is a Raleigh Chopper SUV on a Mondeo floorpan and no exotic materials or engineering.,"February 8, 2019"
Navlet,"No I haven't driven a Stelvio. I was referring to your original post and the designs for an SUV. Most women who buy these cars aren't interested in the driving experience just what they look like hence why Evoque will sell more than the Stelvio. Don't get me wrong, I wish it was less subjective. Having lived in Australia the only Utility vehicle you would trust your life in the Bush with is a Toyota Land Cruiser with extra fuel tanks ,winch, CB radio and pneumatic pump non of which will be in a Stelvio or Evoque.","February 8, 2019"
cue2,"I remember when the Ewoque was launched and an aspirational neighbour really wanted one. She seemed to like the fact it was a Range Rover rather than a mere Land Rover.

They had recently upgraded to a new RR Evoque and were describing the fact it didn't work , to an RAC man. Style over substance.","February 8, 2019"

My two local garages are Thames Motor in Slough and Palmers in Hemel Hempstead.I drove the other car I have been looking at, the new Honda CRV Hybrid, yesterday. I do really like it; it's top of the range EX so has everything on it, AWD, leather seats, HUD, heated front and rear seats, heated steering wheel, panoramic opening sunroof, remote tailgate , lots of security and sensors, very practical etc . Drove it for an hour and, although the claimed 0-60 for the car is 9.x, it felt faster due to the electric kick when pulling away. It was very quiet and pretty smooth overall. A bit gutless when in normal drive mode with Eco enabled, but livens up in sport mode - problem is then you get a big hit on the MPG! It would be very easy to drive and live with and if I had a young family where practicality is very high up the agenda then it would be a good car to have.As I stated earlier in the thread, I have had at least 10 hondas over the rear, usually as a second practical car and frankly was just going to get the CRV Hybrid. However I felt a little cheesed off that the current CRV diesel I had basically had dropped in value so much (not worth more than i owe on it), they aren't competitive with the interest rate (6.2%), no discount on the new car (guess they think it will be a runaway success), only a 3 year warranty on the car (though more on the batteries), servicing not included (costs 599) that I felt compelled to look at alternatives.Honda is however giving away a free Honda lawnmower if you buy an SUV in Q1, great.I then took the Milano 280 for a spin again, and it was great. Drives better, faster, looks better and give the 5 year warranty and 3 years free servicing and roadside assistance it gives me piece of mind.

Gator1,"An opinion from across the pond. If you want a new car, you will pay ~£14,000 (£7K + £7K payments in 2 years) for it in this deal. If you want to keep it, then you will pay an additional ~£26K at the end of the lease. If you turn it in, then you enjoyed a new car for 2 years. Of course, for this to work, don't go over the 8,000 miles a year, otherwise....It always comes down as to how badly you want a new car and the entry point (£) for it. Cheers.","January 24, 2019"
jellemr,"If you're not thinking of keeping it, and aren't going to go over the 16k miles, then you'd be about £1,500 better off by taking the PCH option on this car on their website. Same 2 year term, same car, same mileage, smaller deposit (£3k) for a slightly higher monthly fee (£377).On the PCH you get GAP insurance, RFL and roadside assistance thrown in, but I think you lose the free servicing option (on 16k miles you'd have to pay for 1 service).","January 24, 2019"

hbv,If you order a Stelvio I recommend to add the adaptable suspension including the limited slip differential. I promise you that this will satisfy your expectations: the Stelvio at least with this options has an extremely good street holding and the body moves less. However the car is bigger than your Giulietta and you are seated higher. This needs a couple of days of experience and adaption. I had before a Audi Q5 but the Stelvio is miles better on the road.,"November 8, 2018"

Isotope,"Really? I had most of my time in the car in the dark so I couldn't really push things as far as I can in the G. The technology upgrade is very desirable but does it feel faster? I'm not sure, I know I can't change gear faster than the gearbox in the Stelvio but its a heavier car. I found the suspension too soft on rougher roads. Does it firm up with faster speeds?","November 8, 2018"
hbv,Sorry no. There is extremely dry and sunny weather in Switzerland. So far no snow on the roads. I am also very much interested to see how the car will perform on winter roads.

Thinking of getting them to re-set my sensitivityAlfa Recall Ref. 8223 has happened and work been done. Now we need lots of rain to see if they have worked. Rear Tailgate seals to prevent water getting in switchgear and activating release lock when moving plus A pillar water ingress onto electrics under bonnet which causes multiple 'warning's on various Lamp Circuits (Indicators etc - false warnings) I continue to love the car, and driving it puts a grin on my face. Forget trying to get any kind of 'good' fuel consumption, well especially if you want to 'drive' it. Nicely thirsty, but I didn't expect anything else. By the way Wheel Bolt Torque (from my supply dealer) 120 Nm. This is not anywhere to be found in any of the 'Handbooks' that came with the car, well I can't find it. Still do not like the 'gear' selector (sharp edges) and I still say it is too fiddly, very awkward to make fast selections between Drive / Park / Reverse and so on.

The work took much longer than the 1 hour estimated in the letter because they had a bunch of other things to do (I hadn't been advised of those).

It is very annoying, and drips on your head if you forget it! Suppose it doesn't rain that much in Italy :>)) All the plastic / rubber detail and trim around the tailgate is badly designed and serves mainly to attract and hold dirt and damp as far as I can see.

m100leeds,"adamcot said:Most cars have some sort of recall against them in their lifetime. My old Jaguar XE had a recall for a fuel pipe rubbing against the body.... that's much more alarming!It's a simple change to the wiring/water management in the tailgate area and is only an issue if there is significant amounts of water in the tailgate. The only reason that it is an official ""recall"" rather than a normal ""service bulletin"" is that there is a potential for the tailgate to open at speeds up to 3mph without warning.

I now use a narrow country road that would make a decent hill climb course. I do this as it's so addictive to put the car in Dynamic mode, gears to manual and flick the paddles. Once at the top of the hill, back to Natural and Automatic and relax once again.There is much talk on here about dealer experiences, so I should report that I got the car from Donnelly's in Mallusk (near Belfast) and was very happy with the treatment I got.Unfortunately, my Stelvio is still the only one I have seen in the wild.

Rossorichie,"Picked up my new Stelvio from my local dealer in Exeter - 2.2D 210bhp Milano (Trofeo White). Its the first automatic I've owned - I've driven loads of autos over the years and this implementation has a sporty feel when driven in ""D"" (DNA) mode - nice. Brings a huge grin to my face. The vehicle feels big when you first get in (looks large from the outside) but it seems to shrink when you drive it and it feels, unlike other SUVs I've driven, like a car. It comes with an HK sound system which is extremely good. The collision dectection system is a hoot especially around the narrow lanes we have here in Devon. I'm looking forward to taking it on a long drive up to Northumberland later in the month and expect to get some pretty amazing fuel consumption figures - the vehicle weighs in at 1660kg compared to my previous workhorse a 210 bhp 159 Q4 Sportwagon which weighed a couple of tonnes so I'm losing the three rugby players who have been living in the boothttp://www.alfaowner.com/Forum/images/smilies/biglaugh.gif","June 19, 2018"

The dealership environment is no where near as shiny and special as that of the competition, I think the buying experience is important at this level and does genuinely make a difference.Anyway, looking forward to doing many miles behind that steering wheel!Click to expand...I also bought from Nuneaton too.

Biscione1750,"On the Jeep forums one of the posters who is apparently in the know suggests that an RHD version of the Trackhawk will be made. If that happens I expect both Trackhawk and the Stelvio QV will be available in Oz, early 2018. Thought of having 700hp+ under your feet is tempting but I think Stelvio's handling and chassis tuning will be in a different class. Also Stelvio is a more reasonable size.There are already people in Australia leaving deposits to be on the waiting list for the Trackhawk. The SRT version is a fairly common site in Sydney.","April 15, 2017"

An Alfa Romeo in around 2ft of water will have bigger problems than water ingestion.With a weight so low to get that all important power/weight value, it'll probably start floating before it 'wades' anywhere.In the QV, there is so much carbon fibre, that the car will likely be nice and buoyant, and the quad exhausts make for an instant jet-ski.","November 28, 2016"

Why £20k more than the Giulia?You can get the Maserati Levante, from the SUV class above, and with even more badge kudos than Alfa, from £54,000. Granted the price soon goes skyward once you add a couple of options, but the basic spec is still generous.They cannot logically price the Stelvio entry model at over £50k - it'd mean the larger SUV being more expensive than the Maserati equivilent, thus completely devaluing the Maserati brand.

Dynamically, the Alfa comes close; in terms of ride comfort, even the Stelvio’s optional bigfoot 19-inch wheel/tire package is more spine-friendly than the corresponding Macan footwear.

Guvernator,"I can think of 3 advantages of an SUV over an estate off the top of my head.1) Better visibility. The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.

Kitchski,"Guvernator said:I'm not a fan of SUV's either but for the purposes of getting an average family from A to B they really are one of the best options due to stuff already stated above, well it's either that or an MPV! So all the scorn on PH, either the majority of PH'ers are rich bachelor singletons or powerfully built company directors who pack the kids off to boarding school or let the nanny kart the kids around so don't have to worry about the practicalities of moving kids around.The SUV is still no-where near as good as an MPV at carting the brood around. You'd struggle to get three decent kids car seats across the back of that, so unless you've got two kids or less, you'd still be better off in an MPV. And if you've got two kids or less, a normal saloon or estate would do the job fine. We've only got an S-Max because one of our kids split into two before they were born, the cheeky feckers.Some people who care too much how others perceive them might insist on trying to cram everything into a tool less-suited to the job, but the MPV is just made for families, pure and simple.

For family transport at 3/10ths, the added lat grip and sharper handling afforded by a lower COG would be of zero impact in the real world of real facts based on real science. Our Tiguan is actually a surprisingly good handler despite the high COG, I blame the quality kinematics and tyres for that. Performance of the 2.0 TDI 150 is ample : on the road I find that the limiting factors are line of sight, traffic and licence preservation. Granted, MPG is probably 5mpg worse than an equivalent estate.

I personally don't see the advantages of an SUV over a normal estate car. You obviously do. We can leave it there, it doesn't need elaboratingNot trying to convince you. You can't see the benefits compared to an estate - I can't see ANY benefits that an estate would have compared to an SUV. But remember you're the one elaborating with a bizarre collection of obsolete clichés at 14.00, so I am quite happy to leave it there.Without wanting to inflame this debate any further, I know we are now living in a new world of 'Alternative Facts' and it may be true to say that you cant see any benefits of an SUV over an Estate. However, in the real world of real facts with their basis in real science, surely you cannot dispute that (in relation to a similarly powered and priced SUV alternative) an estate would:be lighter,have a lower COG,have better performancebe more aerodynamicgive better economybe dynamically superior as a result of the above.Unless you don't see any of these things as benefits?Fair comments but I take the Megane RS for track days or spirited driving, that's my alternative fact for you. For family transport at 3/10ths, the added lat grip and sharper handling afforded by a lower COG would be of zero impact in the real world of real facts based on real science. Our Tiguan is actually a surprisingly good handler despite the high COG, I blame the quality kinematics and tyres for that. Performance of the 2.0 TDI 150 is ample : on the road I find that the limiting factors are line of sight, traffic and licence preservation. Granted, MPG is probably 5mpg worse than an equivalent estate. But then again superior residuals more than offset that.So zero real world downsides and loads of real world benefits (comfy ride, easier access, better visibility, smaller physical footprint). For family use, the choice is simple, despite the ghastly image and the PH scienceEdited by nickfrog on Tuesday 28th February 17:33This is pretty much spot on in my view.There is so much hate for the idea of an SUV, especially an Alfa one, but the reality is some of them do a pretty decent job of being a jack of all trades, and get surprisingly close to being a master of some.I moved from an Alfa Giulietta to a Skoda Yeti (4x4 170 bhp) as a practical car the Yeti is in a different class to the Giulietta, as a car to have fun in on the back road it is almost as good too, what it looses in not being being quite as stable, it gains in providing a better sight line for corners, with its higher driving position. Then you add in the other advantages, much more room for a dog, tow capacity which is genuinely useful, ground clearance to take it down unclassified tracks across the moors, four wheel drive to make that less of a worry.I do miss the style of the Alfa and if I'm being badge conscious I miss owning a modern everyday Alfa, so the Stelvio makes a lot of sense in my world. Mind you what I do have to consider Is the fact it will cost half as much again as the Skoda!. nickfrog said: Motormatt said: nickfrog said: Kitchski said: Edited by nickfrog on Tuesday 28th February 17:33 ","February 28, 2017"

Evilex,"nickfrog said:The thought process is simple. They tend to be a better functional alternative for transport than traditional estates or saloons for many people. They're slightly shorter than an ""equivalent"" estate yet offer similar interior space ; they offer a higher driving position which is brilliant for visibility, touring, ease of access. They tend to have taller sidewalls and longer travel suspension which is a good combo for comfort.They are dynamically superb despite the high COG but won't quite match a lower car, which is no big deal as they're not track cars. They use a little more fuel which is offset by better residuals. No downsides IME. I am sure they are also bought for fashion but that shouldn't come into it objectively ; many buy them despite the image as they don't really care about what others think.Er... have you not just almost described a Fiat Multipla? nickfrog said: ","February 28, 2017"

The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.4. 4WD with no transmission tunnel.OK, only the X5 , Discovery and Range Rovers do this .. but gives loads more interior space Guvernator said: ","March 01, 2017"

I think we would have gotten to better results at least decade quicker. But the MPV image? So uncool. So not much development or demand. Good thing I don't need a compact people carrier at the moment, or I would be moaning about the lack of a B-Max ST, Scenic RS or Sportsvan GTI/GTD .I agree with you - they fixed the SUV to make it as good as the ""monospace"" while still resembling a pseudo off-roader - they got there in the end by using hatch underpinnings but that's a strange way indeed to re-invent the wheel without making it too square !Amusingly the MPVs are now trying to look like SUVs - cue the new Scenic which is as high as Kadjar but ONLY comes with 20' wheels when the Kadjar can be bought with 17's!!

thegreenhell,"big_rob_sydney said:Matt Bird said:Sorry! Stelvio is 4680mm long, 1670mm high and 2160mm wide. X3 is 4657/1678/1881 (suspect width is without mirrors here) and F-Pace is 4731/1667/1936 (again I think without mirrors). Alfa made no mention of hybrids at all and has clearly invested a lot in the diesel here, with a focus still on it. That there will be a 180hp version with two-wheel drive in time suggests that will be pitched as the eco version.MattBloody hell, 2160mm wide!?!How on earth will these things fit into the typical shoebox that is a british garage???More to the point, how will they fit in a standard sized parking spot? And what of doors getting dinged by other people needing to access their own cars before you come along and creep into their space due to your own leviathan proportions...?I get that its light compared to some others, but it does seem to be quite wide.I've seen it listed elsewhere as 1903mm (excluding mirrors), which puts puts it midway between X3 and F-Pace width.I don't know why Alfa have taken to quoting width including mirrors (although that figure obviously has its uses) when nobody else does. They did it with the 4C, and everyone slated it for being wider than an Aventador when in reality it wasn't when measured in the same way. big_rob_sydney said: Matt Bird said: ","March 03, 2017"

I think I get around 27mpg overall but I don't imagine the Stelvio will reach that with the 4x4 drivetrain being dragged around - but could be wrong.Also, bear in mind the pretty short 9000 mile (or annual) l service intervals which add to the overall cost. And also, trying to find a decent dealer for aftersales care is no mean feat.If you'd like to know anything more specific, just let me know.Thanks for your reply, food for thought.

aspender,"Practicality:Boot is a very reasonable size, nice and square and with no loading lip. We can pretty much everything we need for a 5-day trip to center parcs into it (e.g. buggy, large suitcase, trunki, then stuff packed around them. Back seats are fine for car seats and the isofix points are very well done (small plastic flap to lift up, no hunting around to find them) rear space isn't amazing. I have the drivers seat fairly far back and there's still room for an adult behind me, but it isn't expansive. Headroom in the back is fine. I have the pano sunroof which makes it quite airy back there too. However without pano, with privacy glass and the swooping line of the roof I can image that it might feel a bit more claustrophobic than it actually is. There are two USB charging points for the back seats but they don't connect to the infotainment.In the front things are all good. Seats (Milano Edizione ones) are good and well adjustable with memory. A nice touch is if the drivers seat is set forward of the B pillar it will automatically move back to allow easy ingress/egress when the engine is switched off. There's USB on the center console and in the glovebox. I have a mini-USB stick of the daughters music in the glovebox permanently attached and still use the console one for charging my phone. The climate control feeds directly into the glovebox but tbh I've never found a use for this. Two good cupholders (concealable) in the centre console along with a useful phone slot between them. Glovebox is very small. Door storage is fine.We cycle a lot. I didn't spec the roof rails but do have Whispbar roof bars and a couple of bike carriers which fit fine and actually look pretty good. It's not such a high car that getting bikes on/off the top is too difficult.Driving:All very subjective... but for an SUV it is definitely fast enough! If you want to drive it spiritedly it will play ball. Of course if really pushed then the laws of physics come into play, it is still a high vehicle with a bit more weight, but overally the reviews rightly laud the drive dynamics. Steering is fast but I've not found that it is too fidgety like some reviews say. Conversely when you just want to get from A-B the car is just a nice place to trundle along in. The gearbox never misses a beat in full auto mode. DNA selector is 95% of the time in 'N' for me with occassional 'D' and never 'A' unless there's snow. There is a marked difference in throttle responsiveness and gear selection between 'N' and 'D' but for everyday driving with 'N' you can just downshift with the paddles to execute an overtake etc. Engine noise is what you might expect from a 4-pot turbo but after a while it has got a bit more tuneful.MPG is... well thirsty. In 12k miles I've averaged around 24mpg. A long motorway drive might get 30 or so.Other stuff:Had a few niggles covered by warranty - filler cap tends to warp and stick out a bit. Alarm can be over-sensitive and needs adjusting. I've only had one significant mechanical that required the ABS pump to be replaced. AEB can be a bit over-keen in warning you of impending doom e.g. when turning near oncoming traffic (but doesn't kick in)Mostly though, it is still a very unusual car to see around and 18 months in I still get a kick every time I look at it or drive it ","April 28, 2019"

Yes the infotainment is better (the performance pages are actually quite useful) the driver assistance stuff works well etc, but fundamentally it's the same overall driving and cabin experience and the mechanicals are not really much different (on the Stelvio QF there are engine changes, notably the introduction of both direct and port injection to avoid the need for a GPF. There's also a rumour of a 1.5cm lower ride height)If you can get second hand with Carplay/Android Auto, I'd say that would be a great car regardless.

Bencolem,Surprised no-ones talked weight… this is a quarter of a tonne lighter than the X3 M40i it’s being compared to in the comments. ,"May 14, 2023"

If you compare four- with four- the difference seems to be about 100, maybe 150kg, which is still significant but a bit more sensible! Bencolem said: ","May 14, 2023"

Neither being great but the quadrifoglio can be forgiven for having a nice sound and sooooo much power.I'm taking an X3 M40i out tomorrow to do the same route and having owned a 40i engined BMW before I'm expecting the X3 to easily top 30mpg if not 35mpg despite being 250kg heavier. It's also got a lot more tech.I've pretty much written off the Stelvio already, the ride was very crashy and seats aside (they were very comfortable) I didn't get on with the interior.

The others have a slight needy image to them where the Stelvio stands alone and says “fk it, I don’t care what others think of my car choice”. ","May 15, 2023"

It was also a better ride than the Alfa which surprised me!. QuattroDave said: RonnieHotdogs said: kambites said: ","May 15, 2023"
