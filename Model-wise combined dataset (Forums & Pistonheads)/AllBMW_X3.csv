Closem Joe,"Autoputzer said:Stick with the 19"" tires in a square set-up. (front and back tires and wheels the same)When I ordered Frau Putzer's X3 xDrive 30i, all-season, non-run-flat tires were an option. They're not, anymore. I've had some X3 loaners with run-flats. BMWoB (BMW of Bubbavlle) has a practice of under-inflating the run-flat tires on loaner cars by about five PSI so people don't' complain about the ride (and buy an Audi the next time around).The gold standard for ""ultra-high performance, all-season"" tires is the Michelin PS A/S 4. They make them in 245/50-19. Try to negotiate having them switched for the OE tires as part of new-car prep. Since the OE tires would be sort of new (never driven by a customer), they might be more willing to take them in trade and use them to refurbish an X3 heading to their used car lot.The PS A/S 4's are probably skewed more toward dry pavement performance than other ultra-high-performance, all-season tires. The Continental DWS06+ might be better in the snow.Having that 19"" square set-up gives you the option of doing a four-tire rotation pattern. That will make all four tires were even and make them wear out at the same time. You should get 60k miles out of PS A/S 4's. Keeping the tread depths the same on all four tires will also reduce the slow, steady wear on your xDrive transfer case clutches. At 35k miles, the average tread depth on all four or Frau Putzer's tires fell within a 0.44/32"" window. That window will approach zero at the end of the current rotation stint.BMW recommends 32 PSI in our front tires and 35 PSI in the rear tires for Frau Putzer's X3 xDrive 30i. X3's have close to a 50/50 weight distribution. That lower pressure in the front is for ride quality, not even tire wear. The pressure difference without a weight distribution difference also means the front tire sidewalls deform more, resulting in a smaller rolling diameter in the front than in the rear. Like uneven tread depths, that causes as small, steady grind on those xDrive clutches. If you can tolerate the ride, I'd try using the same tire pressures front and rear. Non-run-flats at 35 PSI front / 35PSI rear will still ride way better than run-flats at 32 PSI front / 35 PSI rear.The downside of the DWS06+ is that they'd need a lot more pressure to wear evenly than the PS A/S 4's. I've gone through three sets of Continentals, two sets of Goodyears, two sets of Bridgstones, and 5.5 sets of Michelins. I also dial in my pressures for even tire wear... a process I call ""Tire Whispering."" The optimal pressure varies greatly between the brands of tires.I'll likely go with PS A/S 4's when Frau Putzer's OE Bridgestone Dueler H/P Sport AS's were out.Click to expand...I'm also getting the PS A/S 4's non-run flats on both of our Bimmers when it is time to buy new rubber. We've gotten use to the run flats but know there will be a postive change when we change over!","December 9, 2022"

Z4530i,"That’s our setup on my wife’s 2020 X3 M40i. I have a 07 Z4 3.0si with summer performance staggered tires and aftermarket struts/coils. As to performance, unless you’re going to track the car, you probably won’t get to the difference point. I push her car through curves (without her in it) and it does very well. Doesn't hurt to have all wheel drive, and the “sport” selection option, plus the hp to pull you through the exits. Two other comments. There’s not much performance all season RFTs available in this size. The two brands I found were not rated very well, so I went with Michelins that are SL versus XL. You definitely do not want summer performance tires in that climate. They turn to bricks as the temps drop below 34 degrees (speaking from experience).","December 9, 2022"
moRider,I've been pleased with the Continental DWS06+ (all seasons) which replaced my summer RFTs. Huge difference in ride quality and I haven't noticed any real difference in handling (better traction in turns but probably due to more tread when I replaced the worn rears).,"December 9, 2022"

I finally bought Pirelli Sottozero 3s and although expensive they ride better than the Alenzas. Even though the 21"" 718 rims look amazing, I would suggest 19"" and not staggered, or 20"" rims.

For the more expensive set up (maybe 20""), they offered the package in pairs (front size or rear size).

I recall one time when I passed someone that was driving 65mph in a 70mph zone and right after I got around them, they were on my tail while I was at 75mph. So I sped up to see how fast they wanted to go and as I approached 105mph, my radar detector lit up so instead of hitting my brakes and slowing down, I turned on my right turn signal and as I pulled onto the shoulder and began to slow down, the other driver passed me and was laughing.

valzat,"Autoputzer said:You assume wrong. A compact spare is a $250 option on the X5 40i. It's the biggest bargain on the options list. It fits under the cargo area floor. A full-size tire and wheel will not fit in the spare tire compartment and would take up most of the cargo area floor.I'd go with the 20"" wheels in asquare set-up, and replace the OE run-flat, all-season, touring (low performance) tires as part of new car prep', and sell them like Magile did (Post #8).There's a big market for ""take-off tires"" from new BMW's. 55% of new BMW's are leased, and it's hard to get 36k miles out of run-flats and still meet BMW FS's 4/32"" minimum tread depth requirement at lease turn-in.I'd replace them with Michelin PS A/S 4's (non-run-flat, all-season, pretty-good-performance tires) if you don't see snow or freezing temperatures.If you see just a little snow, stick with an all-season tire more skewed toward snow performance than the PS A/S 4.If you do see significant snow, think about a dedicated winter tire and wheel set, as shown onShopBMWUSA.com, and treat yourself to some non-run-flat, summer, high-performance tires.If you specifically want a full-size spare tire, get a matching tire, wheel, and TPMS sensor, and do a five-tire rotation pattern (LF > SP > RR > RF > LR > LF). With a five-tire rotation pattern, you'd get 75k miles out of a set of 60k mile all-season tires, or 50k miles out of a set of 40k-mile summer, high-performance tires. 70k miles is about when the average new car buyer replaces their car. If that's the case with you, you could sell the car with five mostly worn out tires, instead of with four almost new tires. For this to make financial sense, you'd have to wear the tires out before they age out (six years in service).Even it you go with a full-size spare, still get the OE compact spare. It's not much more than a jack would be over the BMW parts counter.You should rotate your tires often enough to put each tire in each position twice. So, divide the expected tire life by eight fo the rotation stint duration. A set of 60k-mile all-season tires should be rotated every 7500 miles.High-performance tires wear really fast when new. So, divide the expected tire life by 7.5 to determine the duration for the 2nd through 8th rotation stints. The first stint should be half of that. A 40k-mile set of summer, high-performance tires should be rotated at about the first 2700 miles, and then every 5300 miles after that.Click to expand...Hi there....I have a 2020 X3M40i and need tires. I currently have a staggered set up RFTs on 20"" summer tires. There are so little options. What I am gathering from this thread, is that more options are available is you go non-RFT is a square set up? Does this void the car warranty? I live in Nevada and we get snow and below freezing! Also, I have noticed that RFT tires have no tread warranty. I was hoping to get all seasons but there are none avail. for staggered 20"" that I have seen.","July 28, 2023"

jeshaw81,"Autoputzer said:New BMW models (platforms) come out randomly during the year. They seem to come out when they're ready. Within an existing platform, new model year vehicles usually start production in the third quarter (July-September).Here's a link from another BMW forum that has a production schedule thread, with the original post being continuously updated. It's proven to be fairly accurate over the years.Future BMW model information (7post.com)It says that the next generation X3 (G45) will start production in August 2024. That means that there will be a 2024 model of the current generation (G01). Since the 2024 (G01) X3 is the tail-end of the production cycle, don't expect many changes.Interestingly, the thread says that the current 3 Series (G20) will remain in production until February 2027.

Goblin,"What@Markstsaid. Are you sure for a fact they actually locked ?Or did you just hear screeching tires in the beginning ?A huge lock with a dragging wheel is not normal. Screeching tires in the beginning of the emergency braking process are normal. As you jump on the pedal the ABS will keep wheels at the limit (and beyond) as it sorts them out. A bumpy road and/or a worn suspension will add to the problem (although this tends to mostly impact brake distances, not wheels locking).","July 6, 2023"
patrat618,"I assumed they all locked, but yes all I heard was screeching tires. I don't believe any one tire locked or was dragging. The car braked evenly as could be expected under the circumstances.","July 6, 2023"

Goblin,"Your ABS is fine then. Fear not.Tires will screech, and even leave light skidmarks in some situations, with modern ABS systems.These systems are nowadays advanced enough to keep the tires at the very edge of locking. This has not always been the case - ABS systems were mostly inferior (in pure stopping distance in dry conditions) to non-ABS ones from their appearance on the mass market (early 80's-ish), for several years.The very first systems that were simply better than non-ABS in all conditions, on mass-produced non-luxury vehicles, started appearing in the mid to late 90's.","July 6, 2023"

zohare,"Z4530i said:Is there any other benefit besides ”improving the sound”? Cost? Any idea if it voids the warranty?Thanks.Warranty issues are always more complex then a single thing just voids it. I'm not sure about BMW, I know some dealers/mfrs like to have their service depts note aftermarket parts during visits for future use should something arise but I would guess that's more a lease issue? The key things to note are:-- Dealers are independent of the brand, franchisees. Warranty work is billed to the mfr for an agreed issue under warranty. This means short of very obvious mass recalls and such, in most cases the dealer is essentially acting as your advocate to the mfr so they can get paid. I tend to encourage people to think of the warranty more like insurance damage/claims- lot of similarites like; there are certain things that will basically never be covered; there's an estimate involved that must be approved in particular to begin the work; the ability to acquire the approval is largely dependent on the competence of the repair facility etc etc. Using this mindset of the dealer is your advocate will help you a lot in many warranty situations, as they will have to deal with BMW NA on the other end. If you give them benefit of the doubt in general (but also don't be that guy that takes every stupid answer they provide when a tech is lazy) it will REALLY help you out when something complex comes up. Your service advisors are absolutely the way to do this. Find one that has been there for a while who LIKES their job, that has been their for a while. It's a super tough job, everyone is pissed at you all the time, no one is happy. Mfr wants to deny everything, service mgr wants you to upsell more stuff, and also Joe is back his brakes are still making noise probably because you didn't sell enough wiper blades, customer is mad their car isn't done on their impossible timeline, etc. Most dealer SAs also rely on sales for their pay so keep that in mind. Why this matters brings me to the second thing...-- Any denial of a warranted item requires the dealer meet some thresholds, some bare minimum evidence to deny the claim. Sometimes they (the independent dealer) have simply have exceeded their mfr alottment of warranty work (yes this is a thing with some mfrs,they have x $ for warranty work in a given period, and it gets distributed to dealers as the work comes in) and will give the most ridiculous reason for denial to avoid paying parts of the claim out of pocket. They may get reimbursed at a lower rate or something, but there's definitely less incentive for them to ""sell"" the work, which is essentially what an SA is doing most times. This is where the situation is usually quickly remedied/stories of a call to BMW NA and it is quickly handled- it isn't common but it can occur. You want to make sure your dealer's service dept is really trying to make sure you get the repair done, and if you're the ""return"" customer that they know by name, they WILL go out of there way and fight for you. Be the customer they enjoy coming in, not the PITA.Magnuson Moss act is something worth reading.So this boils down to what are your expectations of modification and warranties? These cars are so loaded with tech there is no way really to ""hide"" (by removing parts, reflashing for dealer a visit etc) previous modification. However- if you have a legitimate warranty worthy issue, expect that a dealer is highly likely to point the finger back at you, just know your warranty, your rights, the warranty and legal limitations, they also vary some by state. Generally speaking if you take a no BS knowledgeable approach with the SA instead of covering stuff up, they'll work with you. So lets say random engine failure, due to ... Idk. a timing issue or something. They say your exhaust caused it. You say prove it, with evidence. This gets hairy because what typically happens is they do a teardown/analysis, and if they decide to not cover it, you're on the hook for the teardown, AND reassembly if say, you'd rather have someone else repair it/replace the motor. I've seen this happen many times and it's quite unfortunate all around.|| Things that help in the long run: oil samples. You probably see this a lot on here, maybe you do them yourself. But it is a good practice to build records. Work done on your own, keep receipts and dates. Even scribbled hand written records are considered in most cases. General evidence that you care for you vehicle and do your best to maintain it is good.TLR; A catted downpipe will likely only 'void' the warranty of anything ""behind"" it or directly affected by its install. This would likely include the turbocharger, but even then the burden is on BMW to prove that is the cause of some failure they deem is no longer covered. So if you don't plan to really heavily modify it, or tune it, a catted downpipe is very unlikely to cause any issues, and thus you shouldn't ever have a situation arise where it is of concern in a warranty. For example, water pumps, injectors etc can't be read into the downpipe as the cause without some very good mechanical, industry accepted explanations.Experience: Many years as a mechanic, also in rebuilding salvage/auction cars, 3 engine failures and eventually mfr buyback under lemon law for my 2013 FR-S (don't for a minute, even THINK about buying a Subaru built motor.) My car ended up being one of the ones that helped them to discover some significant issues with the FA20 early on. (I was one of the first few who got one) Had to fight for almost a year to get this done, eventually walked into the regional office responsible for buybacks and lemon law cases with a big fat stack of papers. They initially declined to cover because of the intake and exhaust I had installed. Quickly realized the issue was an oil problem...turned out the last oil change I went in for they didn't actually change the oil, furthermore I noted a problem with the SA on that visit, I said it felt like a cam timing issue, but that the car was down on power, didn't feel right, sounded off at idle. (they of course said it was exhaust.)Click to expand...Huge power gain relatively speaking- somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 ft lbs of torque. Sounds better as mentioned. Catted is nice, smooths out some of the intensity of going fully catless. These motors are powerhouses.Good pics OP thanks! Good recommendation to get a new gasket. Planning on doing this soon as I cover the rest of my planned maintenance/upgrades for the year. The guaranteed no CEL is nice, the car will still pickup some power, no tune required.","July 5, 2023"

twistedtree,I have had issues in the past with a 550i where the battery drains quickly when the car is parked for an extended time (weeks to months).

That motor is so powerful that itslowly and smoothlyturns the engine and then when it's rotating fast enough it adds fuel.If you don't want to drive around in Sport Mode all the time, you can shift to M/S (manual/sport) just before coming to a stop. The gear shift has morphed into a large switch on cars with the curved screen dashboard, so that might not be possible with those cars.The EPA requires that cars be tested for emissions and fuel economy on the default configuration when the car is started.

BillD1953,"Last week I bumped up the cold tire pressure on the M40i Bridgestone Duellers RFT to 36/40 psi front and back.Ride quality is still very compliant with Adaptive M suspension set on ""Comfort"".I will rotate every 10,000 miles to begin with and see what tread wear is front to back.","March 5, 2018"
75fusca,Does the space saver spare tire requires the elevated cargo floor? Or it can be accommodated into the regular cargo space?,"March 5, 2018"
Autoputzer,"Yeah, the X3's raised floor is necessary to contain the spare. The X5's area under the standard floor is deep enough for a spare.","March 5, 2018"
Plasman,"Autoputzer said:I had the horrible Goodyear LS2's on my 535i. I had to run them at 15% over the decal pressure to achieve even tire wear, and that made them ride horribly.Get a tread depth gauge and measure and record the four circumferential channels of each tire.If you have 19's on an M40i, you have a square set-up. You would benefit from tire rotation. New tires wear about twice as fast as old tires. Because of this, I've started doing a ""short stint"" for the first tire rotation. I divide the expected tire life (~53k miles for our 19' non-RFT shod X3 30i entering production tomorrow),, and divide that by 7.5. That's my tire rotation duration for the second and subsequent stints. The first stint is half that. Doing this, each tire will be in each position twice by the time the tires reach their expected end-of-life. For me, that means ~3500 miles for the first rotation stint, and 7k miles for subsequent rotation stints.Even with xDrive, most of the power will go to the rear wheels. This means the rears will wear faster. My 535i's rear tires wear about twice as fast as the front ones.Since you have RFT's, your expected tire life will likely be less than with non-RFT's. If you have the performance RFT's instead of the all-season RFT's, that will lower the expected tire life a little more.I start off with the decal pressure +10%, measured in the morning when the car is completely cold and before sunlight hits the tires and heats them up. If it's warm that morning or the car's been in the warmer garage, I adjust the pressure to be the decal + 10% value at the average low temperature for the next ten days. +- 10 degrees F equates to +- 1 PSI.Prior to the next rotation, I measure the circumferential tread depths, and adjust the pressure for the next rotation stint. This periodic tread depth measurement will also identify any alignment problems early.Using this tire ""hyper-management"" it would be possible to get a leased BMW's tires to 36k miles and still meet BMW FS's requirement of 4/32nds inch of tread to avoid the excessive tire wear charge (~$1000). We own our cars. But, my goal is to get Frau Putzzer's X3 to 100k miles (when we'll be done with it) with only having to buy one set of tires (at around 53k miles).Using tire ""hyper-management,"" here were my tread depths of my LS2's at 30k miles, four 7.5k mile rotation stints. I could have easily hit the 4/32nds inch at 36k miles goal important to those leasing BMW's. I got rid of the tires early because of the bad ride, though. A ""+"" in the data means plus ~1/128th inch. A ""-"" means minus ~128th inch.Here's a cheat sheet for tire wear patterns, too.Click to expand...Thanks for those tips. I will watch carefully but doubt I can approach your level of watchfulness. Good going!","March 5, 2018"

JoeD-X3-M40i,"Rebound said:Your car will probably need repairs by 70,000 miles.My 2014 435i has needed quite a bit: Brake pads/rotors, a thermostat, water pump, valve cover, the PVC hose and a few coolant lines. The oil filter housing gasket was replaced under warranty; that’s common. And I replaced the serpentine belt and tensioner proactively.But warranties only cover what breaks. I never figured out whether it was my thermostat or water pump that failed; I just replaced both since one had failed and the other was at the preventative maintenance stage. And replacing both solved my problem.Same with the coolant lines… I preemptively replaced a few; quite easy to do. Brake pads wouldn’t be covered. When your valve cover gasket goes, will they replace the entire valve cover ($550 part) or only the gasket ($30 part?). They wouldn’t have replaced the serpentine belt and tensioner, they would wait until it completely fails, which will probably be after your extended warranty ends.Next up for me is a transmission oil change. Again… BMW specifies that it’s lifetime fluid and it’s not a repair, so the extended warranty won’t cover it.My advice is to learn DIY repairs, do preventative maintenance instead of repairs, and if that isn’t for you, find a reputable independent shop.

Autoputzer,"BMWs in the US used to come with four years (starting from when the car was sold) of free scheduled maintenance with brake fluid being changed every two years (starting at the time the car was assembled). That meant two free brake fluid changes. BMW then changed the first brake fluid change to three years after the car was assembled. That saved BMW the cost of a brake fluid change for every new BMW sold, literally millions of dollars. BMW sells about 350k cars in the US and probably pays dealers around $50 for a free brake fluid change. That's $17.5M per year in savings. BMW claims that the factory brake fluid fill is done in a more controlled environment (low humidity, fresh(er) fluid, etc.), and that justifies stretching out the first fluid change to three years.","June 2, 2023"
jeff3820,"Since brake fluid is so hygroscopic you should change by time rather than mileage. Every 2-4 years is about right. If you live in a humid environment, closer to 2 years. In a mixed or dry environment, closer to 3 or 4 years.. $229 is not too bad for a BMW dealer brake fluid flush. On the wife's car, a Subaru, the dealer charged $120 but that was about 2 years ago.

scott.griscom,"alcarmad said:I have found very few resources to explain the process to remove the intake manifold in my 2019 BMW X3 (G01) with the B46 engine. This is probably because most of these cars are under warranty and no one is working on their own cars. Well, I took my X3 to the dealership due to a check engine light and they noted possible rodent damage to the Coolant Temperature Sensor wire which would not be covered under warranty. I was quoted $1100 just to remove the intake manifold and then there was no guarantee after that how much I would need to spend. I have remove the intake manifold on other BMWs, so figured I could do it myself. Very little information out there, so I figured I'd make this post to start the body of knowledge when someone else has to do this. I am not a professional, but I have owned 8 BMWs and have done enough work to feel confident.Steps:Remove engine coverRemove fabric heat? cover near firewall (2 pop-on clips) so pull at the rubber clips and it will rotate outRemove two torx screws (t20?) holding cables on very top of intake and gently lift freeDisconnect vacuum hoses:-- Started with torx screw (t20?) holding rigid vacuum hose near throttle body; unsnap other end at vacuum junction connector (picture 2)-- Unsnap 4 other rigid vacuum hoses and junction connector and gently rotate out of the way (push tabs and wiggle carefully)Disconnect small top coolant hose connector; simple pop clip with screwdriver and pull straight out. Place shop rag to soak up coolant that will come out (maybe 1 cup). Rotate coolant hose out of the way.Disconnect throttle body with 3 torx screws (t25?); these small black screws where 2 are visible on top left/right of throttle body. 3rd screw is at bottom and you have to feel for it to remove; not too hard. Rotate throttle body connector slightly down and out of the way. Disconnect wire harness underneath throttle body (dont forget to reattach when done!). In picture 3 below shows the throttle body off the manifold...dont do that...keep the throttle body connected to manifold.Remove 2 E11 (reverse torx socket) bolts at throttle body with the second bolt towards the firewall / drivers side slightly hidden under cables (See picture 3)Loosen 5 10mm bolts along the left side (from front to back) on top of intake manifold. Move cables out of the way to see them clearly. They do not come out..simply fully loosen. Hardest is closest to firewall...you just have to move cables and small vacuum connector out of the way gently (See picture 3)Unclip final wire harnesses from top of intake manifold and rotate out of the way (some of these are large plastic clips and others are the small ones...wiggle with force and they will come off without breaking). You are trying to make sure nothing is connected to intake manifold and all the wire harnesses are free to move out of the way.On the lower right side of the intake manifold there is a plastic clip holding/securing 3 coolant hoses (small, medium, and large). Using your fingers, gently pry them out of the clip and push them down below the plastic clip so they dont hang on the intake manifoldAt this point, the intake manifold will be loose and you will need to use troubleshooting to see if anything is in the way of the manifold coming up. I DID NOT remove the lower two coolant hoses under the intake manifold as I was able to move it out of the way without taking those off. If you take those off, be ready to clean up a lot of coolant. The intake will rotate up out of the way while still connected by those two coolant hoses.To move the intake manifold, I had to rotate the right side up and then wiggle the manifold at the back to the right because it was hanging on the back left edge. You will need to see where it hangs on wire harnesses and move the harnesses either up or down and under the manifold as you move it out of the way.At the end I had rotated the intake manifold up and to the left while still connected to the lower coolant hoses. The alternator and area where the major wire harnesses are located were now clearly exposed for my work. I used ties to tie wires and the intake manifold out of the way while i did my work.For my particular situation, I had to solder a new wire where a rat or mouse had chewed through my coolant temperature sensor wire (picture 1). I was successful and cleared the P0118 code later.REASSEMBLYReassembly was pretty much reverse. Just take your time because there are so many connections and wires to get just right. Also, none of the bolts you loosened or removed need to be tightened too much. Remember they are attaching plastic so snug is good enough (use torque wrench to make it perfect but I dont have those torque figures).Take pictures before you start and as you go so you can remember what wires cross over OR under. It can get confusing as you try to remember what was on top and what was under or what routed where. Photos will help.Hardest part was all the wires to the center rear of the engine compartment that kept getting in the way where I was trying to put the intake manifold back down. You have to hold them while wiggling the intake manifold back into place. At first I caught one and didnt notice it and had to remove the manifold and do it again. Make sure the mating surface for the intake manifold is clear and wires arent in the way.Top off the lost coolant and carefully go over everything and put all hoses and clips back in place. Spend time making sure all connectors are exactly as when you started.1.

jacko15,"In the last few days I've toured around to most of the larger new car dealerships in my area, just to see what's available. I was shocked! Dealers that would normally have upwards of 100 vehicles on their lot, had as few as 10 to 15. Most of those were pick-up trucks and a few SUVs. There were almost no used cars available, and the service bays were, for the most part empty. The auto industry around here looks like some kind of dystopian movie set. I was in the market for a new vehicle for the last year, but now I'm trying to make sure the two vehicles I own are in good enough shape to last me at least another 12 to 18 months. I'm almost afraid to go grocery shopping! It's hard to believe my eyes anymore.","October 26, 2021"

However, I miss the way they drive and have always been a BMW fan...even my motorcycle is BMW.So, I will probably go with an M40i or maybe even an X4 (though I had an X6 before and found it to not be as practical as the X3) as it seems to be available with surround view and the other features I like.","October 28, 2021"

So if you know what car you're going to want build it ahead of time, give it 6 weeks to get to you so you either still have a car while you wait or know that you will be without a car for that long. I've been without a car and I am dying! The dealerships have squat to choose from and I wasn't about to get a lease just to get it because that's what they had. I wanted what I wanted. Color, interior, the wheels had a hiccup but they are still awesome.

brrypyn,"My 2 cents: Get rid of the RF tires - I only got 22k on a set on wife's '11 z4 ... lots of tread depth left, but shoulder where belt met sidewall was into cord.

Bmwrob18,"Closem Joe said:Rob, while those runflat tires are new and before you put miles on them contact the dealer where you bought it from and see if they will replace your runflats with Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 4's non-runflats. They probaqbly will because the runflats are a hell of a lot more expensive then the non-runflats! I also have an X3 and I'm about to replace mine with the non-run flats Michelin's. You'll be much happier. I put up with the harsh ride for several years andwhy! Don't do it! It might be OK now but the ride on the runflats will get harsher and harsher as time goes by and since you were smart enough to order the car with the spare, you can do it now and not wait a period of time and put up with the hard, bumpy ride from the runflats. Just some solid advice from an experienced X3 owner. I wish someone told me that when we bought our 19 in Sepember of 18.Click to expand...Thanks Joe, good idea but I’ve already got 3500 miles on it. The ride is ok. I did not get the M dynamic suspension, and the tires have a sufficient sidewall so the ride is ok. On an interesting note, I bought the exact Michelins you recommended and put them on my X5 (traded it for the X3) as it had low profile runflats and the M dynamic suspension.

I'm 6-1 and have more than enough legroom with the seat not fully pushed back and have no issues on my 1200 mile trips from Philly to Florida.,"March 27, 2023"
Autoputzer,"We looked at the F48 X1. But the seats were too small. The ""bucket seats"" were smaller than Frau Putzer's.... bucket. Also, the F48 and U11 are FWD-based platforms, sort of a MINI in drag. It also has a different transmission than the similar-size RWD-based BMW's. Finally, the xDrive on the F48 and presumably the U11 is a part-time system. The rear axle only gets power when the front tires are slipping.The ZF8 used in RWD-based BMW's in the gold standard of automatic transmissions.

This is why I'm predominantly driving a m24ix convertible I picked up, the BMW cars are so much more comfortable and dialed in than the SUV's. I have driven an X1 a couple times and it was a much much better handling vehicle than the X3, due to the smaller size, I probably wouldn't consider letting that one go..

This is called the Lemon Law Presumptionhttps://www.dca.ca.gov/acp/pdf_files/lemonlaw_qa.pdf,"January 3, 2023"

Did they provide any assistance/solution?","January 20, 2023"
former,"I stand corrected. I did not realize I was on a non-official page. While this page (The Lemon Law – Consumer & Business) is from LA County, it’s referencing the California law.

blood_velocity,"So folks. Its been near 3 months since the car is at dealership.

mtbrdad,"In your original post it's a noise from the rear, not sure how this puts you at ""risk"" since there are no catastrophic failures with anything falling off or exploding on this model of the vehicle since inception. So please fill us in on everything the dealer SA has told you, e.g., can they hear the noise, have they done any repairs at all, are they telling you they can't hear the noise, please post a copy of the service invoices you've received so far.","February 8, 2023"
blood_velocity,"So the noise is audible. Very audible to passengers and folks from BMW dealership + BMW Tech. They have done a bunch of trial and errors using multiple parts for 3 months to sort this out but no success so far. They dont know whats causing it so cant tell if its minor or major issue. No invoice around repair as nothing is complete and car is still at BMW under warranty.My logic around noise is similar to what an engine noise would be. Just because noise cant be root caused, doesnt mean it wont cause any issue. Say I am doing a roadtrip and the car breaks down (wobble, rear differential failure etc) in middle of it and help is not easily available, puts me and my family in a difficult position. That to me is ""risk"".","February 8, 2023"

You should be good.Your BMW CPO Warranty coverage can last for up to six years, with no mileage limit.Here’s how it works:Every new BMW vehicle comes with a 4-year/50,000-mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks.When you buy CPO, you’ll enjoy whatever remains of this initial coverage.After your New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage expires, yourBMW Certified Pre-Owned Warrantykicks in,providing an additional year of coverageand removing the mileage cap.Without an extension, your BMW CPO Warranty coverage will endure fora total of 5 years/Unlimited miles, starting on your vehicle’s initial in-service date.However, at the time of your purchase, you’ll have the option toextend your BMW certified pre-owned warranty coveragefor an additional year, bringing that total to6 years with no mileage cap.Does the BMW CPO Warranty transfer to a second owner? Yes! If you’re the owner of a BMW CPO vehicle, you can transfer it to a private buyer. You’ll just need to fill out theCPO Warranty transfer form.WHAT’S COVERED BY THE BMW CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED WARRANTY?All defects in materials and workmanship are covered by your BMW CPO Warranty when they relate to the following areas and components:Engine, Transmission, and Electrical ComponentsBrakes, Fuel System, Steering System, and SuspensionPropeller Shaft and Final Drive AssemblyInterior and Exterior partsIt’s worth pointing out that the coverage with the initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty is even more extensive, so other areas will be protected as long as you’re still less than four years from the initial in-service date, and there’s fewer than 50,000 miles on the odometer.Click to expand...Thanks for the info. I didnt buy the car with CPO warranty. Only the existing factory warranty that came with the car and that warranty ends on Dec, 2023. BMW offered to extend the warranty for two years, for a fee offcourse, if i choose as long as i do it before Dec, 2023.

oz5701,"Autoputzer said:A good rule to live by is ""If a dealership's employee's lips are moving, assume they're lying."" If it ain't in writing, it just ain't.The miles-to-empty is notoriously inaccurate, and it gets worse as the car gets older. When my 2014 535i says ""----"" (zero miles to emplty), I really have about 1.5 gallons (~35 miles at 25 MPG) left. If Frau Putzer's 2018 X3 xDrive 30i every said ""----"" I might as well get out and start pushing.The miles-to-empty is based on the fuel gauge reading and the ""recent"" MPG. Only BMW knows the exact definition of ""recent."" It's the gas gauge inaccuracy that is the problem.The displayed MPG accuracy varies significantly. My owned BMW's have varied by as much as 5%. I've had loaners that were probably even more (based on how much gas it took to fill the tanks). There's a way to adjust the accuracy, but you first need to know what to adjust it to. With older BMW's, there's a ""secret instrument cluster menu"" that allows you to adjust the displayed MPG. I've heard it's no longer there with the newest version if iDrive.Although the displayed MPG is not necessarily ""accurate,"" it is actually fairly ""precise."" It might be inaccurate, but it's consistently inaccurate. If you know the ""correction factor,"" you can calculate what the actual MPG is. Knowing the displayed MPG for the current tank of gas, the correction factor, and the miles since the last fill-up, you and very precisely estimate how much fuel you've burned.I record reset my On Board Computer MPG and trip odometer at fill-up. I keep a ""fuel logbook"" in Excel. The spreadsheet calculates the MPG correction factor (K) for each tank of gas, where:Actual MPG = (1 + K) x Displayed MPG.View attachment 1068740I've adjusted my displayed MPG so that K for my previous two tanks of gas averaged roughly +0.3%. When I make run into town, it's usually to hit Cracker Barrel, Sam's Club, and a Chevron station that has ""full-size gallons"" and the cheapest Top Tier Gas in town. Hitting Chevron as my last stop, it's 18.8 miles from my house to the Chevron. I did my calculations and estimated that I had enough gas to make it to the Chevron. I did another calculation at the Chevron just before I filled up. I estimated that I'd need 16.4 gallons at fill-up. I actually needed 16.5 gallons.A G01's gas tank holds 17.2 gallons. My goal is to burn it down to one gallon, but I sometimes go down to something above 0.5 gallons. I do that to burn off as much gas as possible since gasoline, especially E10 gasoline, starts going bad after about 30 days.Most of that 0.1-gallon error in my estimate was because I switch gas pumps at the Chevron station, looking for a generous one after they calibrated Pump #6 to stop giving away about 0.5% free gasoline. My correction factor for that tank of gas was -0.6%. I'm going back to Pump #6 nest time.BMW's are designed and tuned to run as advertised on 91 AKI gasoline. That's because 91 AKI is highest octane-rating available in California and many high-altitude areas. Octane rating quantifies the ability of the gasoline to burn slowly instead of explode rapidity. You hear those explosions as ""pinging."" Severe pinging can damage an engine.There's something call ""LSPI"" or ""super knock"" that can instantly and completely destroy your engine. Your X3 30i's engine seems to be particularly vulnerable to it. So, you REALLY need to stick with 91 AKI gasoline, despite what some car salesman tells you.Your X3 does an internal octane test after you fill-up and records the AKI rating in memory. If your engine blows up, the dealer can upload that data and see what AKI gasoline you've been using.In most of the country, Top Tier Gas comes in 87, 89, and 93 AKI. If that is the case in your area and you want tosave $4 or $5 per tank, and $1000+ over 100k miles, you can blend 2/3's 93 AKI and 1/3 87 AKI to make your own 91 AKI.It's better to put in the 93 AKI first, so your X3 doesn't get a swig of 87 AKI shortly after driving away from the gas pump. You also get all the 93 AKI you pay for, leaving 87 AKI gasoline in the gas pump's hose for the next guy using it.I've been using ""Auto's Custom Blend 91 AKI"" in BMW's for 21 years and 235,000 miles.Click to expand...Thanks for your careful detailed analysis and presentation. A question, please: what do you think of fuel boosters such as Lucas and Seaform, etc., that offer greater mileage and performance increases? So, filling up with 87 octane fuel, adding the suggested amount of fuel additive booster, and then realizing an octane boost to 91, etc.?

bocabimmer,"Curious, my iDrive gives a variable recommended tire pressure based on TPMS temperature. Seeing and agreeing with your cold/no sun measurement criteria, do you give those recommended temps any consideration?","October 16, 2022"
gphin305,"Autoputzer said:The recommended pressures on the door jamb decal are when the tires are cold (tire temperature equals ambient air temperature). The iDrive compares the tire temperatures to the ambient temperature to determine how much the tires have heated up. It then does the one-PSI-for-every-ten-degrees-F calculation to determine what the pressure should be for the warm tires. If your tires are 30 degrees F warmer than the ambient are, the iDrive would add three PSI to the recommended pressure.I do my roughly bi-weekly manual tire pressure checks when everything's cooled down (tires, and engine). BMW engines run extremely hot, and the engine compartments are sealed up tight (for aerodynamics and to retain engine heat when the car's parked). BMW wants the engine to stay warm so if you restart the car (e.g. on a shopping trip) the fuel economy and emission performance will be that of a warm engine.My F10 535i loses engine heat much slower than Frau Putzer's G01 X3 xDrive 30i. My engine compartment is ""fuller"" (six-cylinder engine vs. a four-cylinder engine, plus less engine compartment volume), and my hood has insulationwhere the X3 doesn't.If I've driven a car the evening before checking and adjusting tire pressures, I open the hood when I get home so that the engine and front tires can completely cool off overnight.My iDrive only reports tire pressure to integer values of PSI. Also, the individual TPMS sensors have varying accuracy. So, I manually check the pressures using a mechanical tire pressure gauge.Click to expand...Any reason why the X3 does not come with under hood insulation? Is this by design (although I have slots and holes to install it) and would it cause issues if one installed an aftermarket hood insulation pad?","October 19, 2022"

gphin305,Thanks for quick reply. I bought and installed one a couple months ago. Just thought it was a cheap cost deletion and every car I've owned has had one.

Autoputzer,"Frau Putzer had a Honda Accord before her X3. The four-cylinder Accords had a steel rod to hold the hood open.

I haven't really timed it, but it seems like the dash lights, screens, and sound system stay on for five minutes, at least. (Locking it turns everything off right away.) And I haven't been able to find anything in the manual about this.So I called in. The Genius I talked with had to put me on hold and consult someone (maybe a Super Genius?) about it, and, about five minutes later, came back and said she didn't think there was any way to adjust this timing.Ah, well.

Has anyone had the same problem before?Thanks in advanceKeith.....New BMW owner,"January 27, 2023"
xidino123,There maybe mud or dirt that block the view of the lane assist camera or the sensor.clean it and see what the outcome.,"February 12, 2021"
Closem Joe,That's correct. I had a similar thing happen. Took it in to the dealer and they cleaned the dead bugs off of the side sensors which somehow slipped by me and it was fixed. That won't happen again!,"February 12, 2021"
astrohip,"Also, just heavy rain can cause it. Sometimes if I'm driving in a deluge, I'll get that message. It goes away when the rain lets up.","February 12, 2021"
moRider,Thanks for the feedback! It makes sense that the rain temporarily created some issues with the sensors/camera. No mud or blockage that I can see and the error message went away. I'll explain to my wife that sometimes these driver aids stop working - most likely when it's hard to see and you need the aids the most,"February 12, 2021"
mwhayden,"The car needs to see the lines on the road also. Snow and heavy rain will obscure the lines. Also, poorly painted roads will cuse the same error","February 12, 2021"
HotGrbg,"It’s not just heavy rain that can cause this. Direct sunlight, strange shadows, fog, weird object ahead of you, many things. If there is a problem then you normally get “ drivers assistance malfunction” and not “drivers assistance limited”. The “limited” message is just informational for the driver where as “malfunction” is a problem with system operation. There may not be a fix and it may be working as designed.","October 18, 2021"
eitan429,,"October 18, 2021"
eitan429,The message I got was that at least one intelligent safety system cannot be activated anyone see that message?I don’t think it’s because of rain fog or some dirt on the camera I think it’s a hardware or software issue,"October 18, 2021"
HotGrbg,There should be a fault stored then and not just “functional limitation” fault that sets for vision issues.Your dealership should be able to remedy the issue if there is one. I wouldn’t be shocked to hear you got a KAFAS camera to repair it IF there is a problem. BMW likes to use “limited” and “reduced” interchangeably which is confusing to people. Again normally problems set “malfunction” messages.,"October 18, 2021"
mwhayden,"There is probably nothing wrong. If the cameras can't see the lines on the road it shows an alert. This can be caused by poor line paint or no paint at all. I have had the same issue from time to time. Also, heavy rain or snow can cause the same problem. Also, make sure to keep all cameras clear of debris, dirt, etc.","October 18, 2021"
aztecnyc,"Funny, Just happened to me for the first time in 3 years. I was driving in heavy rain. Message disappeared in the morning.","October 19, 2021"
Closem Joe,So you know that it is working. It was just the heavy rain that caused it not to see the road! Normal. 🤗,"October 19, 2021"
eitan429,the car is new and clean and it happened on a sunny clear day and message never disappearedi dont think its that simple,"October 19, 2021"

I had the Pirelli P7 summer run flats and got 26k miles out of them and still had another 1/32 before I got to the wear bars, I probably easily could have gotten 30k miles. I was trying to get every last bit of tire out of them, but last November when I went on vacation my son swapped them out for a pair or Good Year Eagle Exhilerate all seasons I had and WOW what a difference in ride and quietness! No wonder everyone on Tirerack says they only get about 20k miles out of the Pirelli's because after that the ride and noise suck!

You still must keep your hands or fingers on the steering wheel and when you don't the green color turns to amber and then after a while to red and if you still don't grip the steering wheel an alarm will go off. I have it. It's a great option especially if you are on a road with light traffic. It's sort of a hybrid of a self steering car. You turn it on, on the steering wheel. Enjoy it but be careful!

X3rd Times A Charm,"I bought a Jet Black 2018 X3 CPO in June 2021 with 10413 miles on it . Checked car on delivery and all looked good. On my first detailing I noticed a dent in the tailgate and reported it to my SA . Looked as though it was opened in a garage and hitsomething.Bythe way , all there inventory is stored in a parking garage.I had a oil change set up and he said we would look at it then . I then later took a better look and noticed that not only was the tailgate dented it was painted the wrong color ! It’s a metallic black color! Not only was the tailgate the wrong color so was the drivers side quarter panel ! So that tells me it’s the second time it was damaged, first time repaired painted wrong color and now another dent . Long story short, they fixed the dent and painted where the dent was and left the rest of the car the wrong color !! Went round and round with the manager and finally he said he would do whatever makes me happy. I’ve talk to them twice since and it still hasn’t been resolved ! Should I get BMWNA involved ? Your input please.","January 17, 2023"

ard,"CygnusBMW said:I disagree regarding factory's not having a ""dog"" in this fight. The CPO is termed an ""express"" warranty by the manufacturer, BMW. It has limitations in its details; under the federal Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, there is an automatic ""implied warranty of merchantability"" by BMW. Simply stated, this implied warranty promises that the product is in at least average condition under the terms of the transaction. The dealership is the agent of the factory. Your argument is that BMW breached its implied warranty of merchantability. Dealer wrongdoing should not get BMW off the legal hook.There is a second argument, against the dealership. The dealer may also be liable here, probably under several theories; implied warranty should also apply. You might want to check your state's consumer protection statutes, and common law fraud by concealment law.One of the ""fixes"" is a full, high-quality repaint. Many of us would not find this acceptable for a CPO vehicle, which arguably was represented as the ""best"" of the best. I am not licensed in your state to give legal advice... this is only information about general warranty law. You may want to contact the Center for Auto Safety, in DC, for an attorney referral for more specifics on your state's warranty, fraud, consumer, and contract laws. Good luck.Click to expand...With all due respect. Unless he is going to hire an attorney and pony up 10, 20k it is not possible to get BMW to recognize they have a dog in the hunt. So to speak.We constantly read about how moss magunseen this or that..the problem, as I am SURE you will agree, is that the venue where this will be decided (where you can assert your rights under all our laws) has a very high price of entry.Did you take cases like this on contingency?????","February 16, 2022"

Some history of the car is I've had it there for wind noise a few times and a leaking moonroof and they've replaced quite a few of the seals as well as the seal around the moonroof and the leaking is gone. Also, during the summer at or above 80°F when the AC is on there's a noise that sounds like a bad fan bearing, I have an old 2007 X3 so I know this sound, they replaced the fan yet the sound was still there.

I found how to switch this in the settings, made the switch, and all was good. Then I stopped into a store, came out and the speedo was back in KPH. Did I miss something in setting this preference?

You do not need to ask the dealer if there is uneven wear and cupping and you do not need to wait for a response. Use your eyes and your hands to answer these questions. Uneven wear is easy to find. If the wear looks, well, uneven across the width of the tire, then you have uneven wear. Wear/tread depth should be uniform across the entire width of the tire. As far as cupping goes, take your hand and lightly run it around the entire circumference of the tire. You will feel any low spots (cupping) which will also be indicated by varying tread depth in multiple locations. Yes your hand will get dirty but this will take you all of 5-10 minutes. Good luck.","July 30, 2022"

I took the vehicle to the dealer and they lubricated the parts in the steering wheel after removing the airbag and put it back together and it was still making the sound. They then removed the parts again, lubricated and replaced the clock spring. There was no indication of a clock spring failure because all of the components in the steering wheel were working and I had no failure alerts. Here we are a month later and the steering wheel is making the noise again. The dealer said I can bring it back in for them to lubricate but it’s more of a nuisance and will not cause any type of issue with the steering wheel or components on the steering wheel.

Powderchaser,I just came back from Munich and checked out the new X1. The interior has changed drastically to more tech and menus versus knobs. I am not sure I am a fan of the center console that seems low compared to the higher seat hight the vehicle offers (Not sure why BMW refuses to have adjustable center arm rests). I am most interested in the professional driver assistance package (Better cameras). No one has been able to tell me if that is coming to the USA. In Germany they just banned it or perhaps the EU as autonomous driving has not been embraced. They had to pull the package off the 7 series also.,"October 13, 2022"
mdino768,"Thanks for the info. I had an x1 in 2016 but was not a fan in terms of the seats and size , but said I would revisit it if they ever enlarged it and changed the seats which seems to be the case with this new one.

Powderchaser,The future models of BMW will likely take a similar path on the interior. I liked the looks of the new X1 being almost the size of an X3. Not sure I liked the squared off look of the taillights. I am happy to see non run flat tires in the US market! The seats seemed comfortable but that was in Munich.

mrjro33,"Mark in NoVA said:Thanks. When this happened to me, I was just struck with how little is out there, and honestly how little was in the manual, on the 12V system, and nothing on the auxiliary battery. There's a decent article I found through Google on Greencarreports about high-voltage batteries and a little on 12V batteries in EVs and PHEVs, but the really interesting part is what looks like pages of comments from people all reporting similar issues, and pretty much no one thinking about their 12V system, which in some cases (I think Tesla's retractable handles, for instance, and even opening the hood to access jumper points in others) is pretty much vital to accessing the car and its systems, even with a fully charged high-voltage battery! Hard to tell from the comments whether there were notes in manuals, or discussions at delivery (I think I took delivery of one of the first 330e's at the dealership, and I kind of believe the subject just wasn't in the delivery guidance. And we did the Genius.) And if the auxiliary battery charges secondarily when driving as well as when on a charger, which I'd assume, it's almost certainly going to degrade faster with short trips. I didn't click on them, but a quick Google search will find pages of hits, mostly looking like problems, with auxiliary batteries in newer Mercedes...I'm a little surprised with the true EVs, but as I've thought about it, a lot of the newer PHEVs are adaptations of existing ICE engine architectures. I had a couple of Priuses for commuting before, and those were ground up purpose built hybrids. They didn't even have a traditional starter as I recall; the regenerative charging system ""reversed"" to start the ICE. Don't know how the Prius Prime PHEV works.And, PHEV BMWs just aren't popular enough on boards that attract enthusiasts to really get much feedback on them. I do love mine, though!Click to expand...My question is, assuming I want to trickle charge the 12V battery, where do the red and black clippers go?

tltx3,"Hi all, I installed the factory hitch by following ktmsmr12's instructions (Factory tow hitch retro-fit kit). For E-sys coding, I chose ""ALL ECU METHOD"" described by ktmsmr12. (A battery charger was connected for this long process) . After that my X3 could go into the ""trailer"" mode if a load was plugged into the 7-pole connector (either a Curt Echo trailer brake controller or my home made test jig). Rearview camera hitch zoom, trailer signals, etc all worked. I also scanned for error codes using an AUTOPHIX 7190 ODB reader. I saw two codes, and they were not related to trailer functionality. One was in the CAS (Car Access System) module. This had to do with the missing tailgate kick sensor because the warning would disappear when I plugged in the kick sensor. The second code had to do with the ECM module (IF2505 DME, encoding: incorrection version detected). I ignore this one temporarily as the engine seemed to run normally.My main focus is on the trailer stabilization control (TSC) in trailer mode. TSC applies brake signal to X3's brakes (not to the trailer) to control sway of the trailer.

What I mean by this is the manufacturers ship them at 50psi to not get flat spots and that's how they sit on the dealer lots, I've already taken delivery of few cars with the tires still at 50psi or better because of the poor quality of dealer prep.2. Get rid of the run flats and go with regular tires, the run flats give a very very rough ride even when aired properly.3. Did you order the m40i with the adaptive suspension, which I hear smooths out the ride some. (I don't have it so I wouldn't know.)4. Spend some time learning how the car handles and drives before drawing a conclusion of it. I've had the X3 for 3 years now and after taking a porsche drivers ed day in a boxster I applied what I learned to the X3 and it feels so much better now.3.5 Years ago when I made my X3 decision I also looked at the Macan but just couldn't justify the cost. I will say that yes the model I test drove was better connected to the rode and had a better rode feel than the X3, but not 20k better.

I imagine if I changed out the rft 19 with non rft it would have improved the ride quality. I recall checking the monitor on tire pressure and it didn’t raise any flags but can’t recall exactly. I did have the adaptive suspension. These things may have helped with the ride but not sure about the connectivity to the road. I completely get the $20k in cost you pay to get that feel as I just forked it out (ouch).For $ reference I paid $63k and traded for $59k (could have sold for $63k pp but local tax laws washed that out).

Here are a few thoughts on some of the vehicles I’ve owned:-TSX was peppy, economical, well built-First 335i was a dream, fast, raw, solid-Infiniti was smooth yet sporty, refined-M2, tried to relive ‘07 335i, fell short-First Porsche/SUV, impeccable, groundedMacan S vs BMW X3 M40i (lived this 2x)On paper X3 was the logical choice.faster, better tech, fuel efficient, valueBefore purchasing my first Macan, I test drove X3 and Macan b2b several times.I asked the Porsche sales rep why the hell I’d pay a premium for such an inferior value. He simply replied, “take it for a test drive”. Then I put my foot in mouth.The difference was night/day.With Macan I was truly connected to the road, it felt solid/confident, the interior quality was impeccable, the balance between agility and comfort was out of this world. I did find the X3 to be fast and fun (just different).Unfortunately I sold my first Macan as I was paying $500/m to park and I wasn’t driving during COVID. More recently I moved and bought a condo so thought I’d save $/gas and ordered an x3M40i (without test driving). To be candid, it felt like a fast, bumpy, plastic box on wheels. Ended up trading it in for the 2023 Macan S before I even filled up the gas tank. Gulp. Given my deep experiences with both brands, I hope you can appreciate the lack of bias in my personal experience. I recognize for many the x3 just offers way too much value to pass on…I couldn’t be more excited to get back in a new Macan S. Now faster, and I added air suspension.

HotGrbg,This test plan is only run if you bring your vehicle in for drivability concerns that aren’t caused by an obvious failure.That being said B engines and more specifically B46 seems to be more prone to LSPI than previous engines. A good way to help combat this is by using good oil with low calcium and an API SN+ or SP rating and high octane fuel. Some owners will notice LSPI and some won’t but the vehicle will set faults for “super knock” and probably be retarding your timing without you knowing. If a tech finds a super knock fault he will absolutely check every single fill up since new. Yes it stores them forever,"September 29, 2021"

It the terminal had too much premium, they'd dump it in the stations regular tank.Back then, unleaded gas came as 87 and 91 AKI.

In my new M40i, each time I placed or received a phone call, on hanging up, the podcast would restart from the beginning. Coupled with the lack of fast-forward buttons on the wheel, this was quite annoying.I did not have Carplay as an option in the store because my car did not have Enhanced Bluetooth enabled (though the ability is there). So I bought an iPhone app and a obdg connector (google BimmerCode) and enabled both Enhanced Bluetooth and Wifi. Carplay appeared and I was able to purchase it. It works a lot better. No more problems with my podcasts.I find myself using apple maps quite frequently too. Though there are no heads-up display instructions, the maps are easier to follow than the stock BMW (that zoom in and out in a rather capricious way).

QSilver7,Your owners manual should list various tire sizes in the tire inflation (pressure) chart. Did you get a chance to look there yet?Or you can use the site at the following link…compare each setup for the existing front to the other front…then the exiting rear to the other rear to see how much (if any) difference between the wheel/tire setups is doable:www.willtheyfit.com,"September 10, 2022"

Delrazdan,"avinashgautam said:Hello fellow Bimmers,I come here to this group to share my experience with Bimmer-Tech sound system products that I recently bought for my X3 G01. I wish to share this with you because when I first began looking for a sound system upgrade in the fall of 2020, I could not find conversation from anyone who had installed the entire kit. I hope that insight from me can help my fellow bimmers make better decisions.They have a range of combinations to choose from. I went for top of the class set, bought an Alpha One Studio Sound Complete Speaker Set and a Premium Sound System amplifier. I have not gone into detailed technicalities of entire process but will be happy to guide based on my experience.Studio Sound – Alpha One Complete Speaker SetI recently bought an US X3 G01 series base model which had basic S676A HiFi basic sound system. I am a serious audiophile, and I wanted my car to sound good but the moment I turned up the volume, I was disappointed to the core. I wondered why such a luxury brand car would sound just ok, even my ex-Honda was beyond better. Within one ride I decided that I needed an upgrade. I started searching the internet for a solution and then Bimmer-Tech, a brand name that echoed as an elite life savior for many BMW owners, emerged. They had launched their Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set along with a customizable amplifier Premium Audio System. Reading through the product, I could get a clear picture as to what is under the hood since the specifications were clearly listed. I liked their introductory videos on the product which gave me confidence to buy. Now there are other players in the market with lucrative deals, however, there is catch – You will either not know what the specs are, or you will have to cut some wires and get it all setup. I talked to many local car stereo shops and other players, but no one could convince me like Bimmer-Tech.I ordered the Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set and Premium Audio System amplifier. Yes, I recommend you get the amplifier for sure. Even without the amplifier, the speaker set is super awesome and transforms audio in your car but at the same time, being an audiophile, I realized that it shows how weak the factory amplifier is. You will get a feeling that there is more that can come out, but the factory amplifier won’t just do it. Coming back, I got the delivery within 5 days of placing the order. The packaging is premium and had feel-good feeling to it, you will appreciate that you ordered a premium product for your luxury car. Installation video was not available for my car, but Bimmer-Tech prepared an instruction document for me quickly and sent it over before the product arrived.I started with the center dash, was a quick and easy plug and play installation after which I just gave a song a try. My Oh My! The sound just changed with one center dash set. I could notice the difference. I quickly went for the front doors and tested a song again. The front of the car - the cockpit had transformed into this new sound arena. In no time, I jumped to rear speaker set and voila, the old damping dull BMW sound had gone. My car became alive. Point to note here is when I just changed one speaker set, I could notice the sound difference. So, for those who are not willing to buy complete set, Bimmer-Tech recommends doing it in stages. My personal recommendation would be to do driver’s choice set first. The build quality of the speaker is super solid, sturdy and premium. When you hold them in your hand, you will yourself notice that this is no ordinary product in your hands, the make and manufacture clearly give you an insight as to how awesome they will play your music.Premium Audio System – PP86My Alpha One Complete Speaker Set had rocked my car by transforming it into a new sound arena. I was enjoying music way better than factory speakers; however, I was having this feeling that there is more than can be done. Something is stopping that sound power to not flow. I began installation of my Premium Audio System amplifier which took not more than 45 minutes. It had come pre-loaded with custom tuned file for my car. When I turned it up, I could immediately notice a change in power. The sound was rich, it wanted to travel with all that power. It was like something had just opened the door to a charging horse in a racetrack. This experience was above and beyond of what native speakers and especially the amplifiers had to offer. For the first time, I felt the bass under my car seat. It was punching me, telling me that I am here to rock your world. I was happy and wanted to take things to another level.I reached out to Bimmer-Tech and got introduced to Maciej, who a sound specialist (among other things), understood the sound I was looking and started working with me on a tuning file best suited for my taste. This is where Bimmer-Tech is exceptionally good in customer service, they take things to next level. I got a call from Maciej and was literally interviewed of what kind of sound I like. In a few calls and email conversations, Maciej provided me a tuning file that took my sound experience to a whole new amazing level. Maciej from Bimmer-Tech had created a sound plane for me in my driver seat where every speaker of the car was pumping balanced audio to my ears. It was like that the music was right in front of my ears and I could just hear it.We didn’t stop here, we went ahead and started replicating the sound experience of the driver seat to every other seat in the car. I was surprised to see the customization of the amplifier. Bimmer-Tech provides you with a software and a detailed user guide. Basically, you don’t even need to wait for Bimmer-Tech to help, you can yourselves customize the tuning file real time. However, you can ask for their help and they will never cease to amaze you. If you have a X3 G01 like me, ask for the tuning files they had prepared for me and you will like it.So, after a 50+ emails, 10+ tuning file samples and 1 working session, I finally have the sound that I desire in my car. The customization of the Premium Audio System amplifier combined with their Alpha One Studio Sound Speaker set is a perfect way to transform audio in your BMW. I seriously think that Bimmer-Tech should partner with BMW and teach them a thing or two on car sound.This journey with Bimmer-Tech has been amazing and it has made me their permanent customer for my X3. I have already purchased a few other products from them.To ConcludeWent for top of the class set, bought an Alpha One Studio Sound Complete Speaker Set and a Premium Sound System amplifier from Bimmer-Tech. Fast shipping as products arrived within 5 days of placing order. Packaging is of premium quality. Make & manufacture quality of the speakers is sturdy & premium. Simply plug and play installation with readable or visual instructions depending on your car. Sky and earth difference in sound quality when played on Bimmer-Tech speaker eco system than on the factory speaker system. Amazing, rich, vibrant, clear sound with a punchier or travelling bass quality.

avinashgautam,"I paid the price of the products and some tools that I bought from Amazo. Car shops were asking a labor price of $800+ so chose to do all the work myself. I paid some $899 for Amplifier and $1298 for the kit. Got a trim tool kit for ~$15 or less. T50 torx bit , 3/8 Drive Socket set ~$50 etc. The best way to plan is to read the installation guide and see what is needed for the car.","March 16, 2021"

rene195806,"avinashgautam said:Hey Buddy, I just happened to visit a local car stereo shop in California yesterday and this Alpha one set is a known name and a recommended one. I just happen to ask car stereo shop owners, every now and then, about bimmertech sound products to satisfy myself that my decision was right. Honestly, this is the only 2nd shop I had visited for some dashcam work. However, yes if you want to choose other options at the store, everyone is happy to customize and fit your budget. I too had done this comparison before going for Alpha One. For there complete set price bracket, I chose individual components online like speakers, tweeters, wiring, subs, amps and could find similar or higher configs within the same or a little less range. Yeah, as I went higher looking for configs I found more options and saw that by spending another 500 bucks I could double the sound. I even had this vague idea of getting trying some company and sending them the product back. So why alpha one after all this?1. First , I could not find any amp that is highly customizable like the one in Alpha One set. Bimmertech worked with me live remotely and tuned the sound for me in my car. I have 3 to 4 config files from them that suit my various sound needs. Ask them for some preconfigured g01 customer files and they will be happy to share. So,I have a surround one that attempts to give equal sound experience to every passenger in the car and then I have another one that pumps all sound to me in my driverseat.Ondays when I will be driving alone I choose to change. Also, I do have kids sometimes in the car and I can just turn off speakers on their side. Its just awesome because I can still play loud enough music without doing anything damaging to the kids ears2. There speakers come preconfigured for bmws. The size fits the spacing perfectly. The speaker size of bmw is small compared to other brands and there casing to hold the speaker too is small. When I was shopping online I couldn't find bmw sized speakers, they were of regular size and a lot of cutting and then aound proofing the space would be needed to fit a market product.3. Plug and play was another thing. I did not cut any wires but was just connecting the cables like you put usb into usb drive.All of this made mecrealise that its better to fit a product that is sized for bmw and configured for your car vin.I am also eager to read what other enthusiasts have to say.Click to expand...hi is that brand for sale in Europe?","April 27, 2022"
jindeezy,"Hey! I am actually going through the same process. Where in California are you located? Would love to hear that Bimmertech speaker setup in person.I'm currently doing my audio upgrades in stages and went a different route. Using the Match UP 7DSP amp w/ Earthquake SWS-8Xi underseat subwoofers. The speakers are still stock HiFi and am considering going full Audisons for that.Do you happen to have a noise floor issue with your setup btw? When I'm listening to music very low or have nothing playing, I can sometimes hear an intermittent faint whine or high-pitched noise.","April 29, 2022"

Mine was never fixed, but what I've managed to do is each morning when I start the car, I turn off the air altogether (I hear vents adjusting in the dashboard), wait a couple of seconds when the adjusting stops, and then turn the air back on. This apparently ""flexes"" whatever is happening with the vents that's creating that whistling noise. Not ideal, but at least the noise has stopped.","October 10, 2019"
maxxym,"Well...the dealer was able to duplicate the sound, but their explanation was totally unacceptable to me. They said that this noise is caused by how air is mixed in some ways.. whatever.. it's not important.

TonesK1200GT,"yeomanle said:I took it into the shop, showed them the multiple videos of the sound and the Service Center lead said it was the first time he had heard anything in his entire time w/BMW. Not sure if I believe that but whatever.They kept my car a couple of days, called later to indicate they couldn't duplicate the sound, I told them to turn on/off the recycle air and AC and that it would typically only happen in the mornings. They called a couple of days later to say that they were able to duplicate the sound and that they believed it was a flap that was getting stuck during the opening/closing process and that they would have to do some update the programming to fix it. A couple of days later, they said that they believe they ""fixed"" it with the broader update.The next morning, per usually, the sound happened again, but this time, through the programming update, the digital compass was completely deleted! I brought the car back the next morning and showed them that the compass was deleted and they check their updates and noted that the compass deletion was a known issue but that they didn't have a patch fix yet. So still waiting on that. Re: sound, they said keep recording and see if the sound happens again and bring it back in. I opted not to keep my car there any longer.So even though the problem happened the day after I picked up my car, the sound isn't happening as regularly as it was before. There was a full week where the sound didn't happen at all but it has happened on a handful of occasions (but not as regularly before I brought it in).I live in Austin, where it is currently 104 degrees so I'm not sure if the heat ""melted"" whatever the issue away and is making the flap ""unstuck"". But I do believe it has something to do with the AC starting/stopping when the Auto Start/Stop is operating. I played with the AC off and the squeal has happened as well.The frustrating thing is the randomness of the sound, which makes it difficult to troubleshoot and pinpoint exactly what the issue is b/c it's like telling the doctor your arm hurts, but only some of the time and when you see the doctor, your arm isn't hurting at that time.Keep me posted if you hear anything. My sense is that this is a wider issue and BMW has to be alerted in order to fix it broadly.Otherwise the car operates fine, but frustrating when it's your first venture outside my typical Subaru/Honda liking (never had a single issue with either for over 20 years) that for a 2019 it's had one thing after the other...Click to expand...","February 23, 2021"

Generally it can be heard really well when driving about 20mph on a side street with no radio on. To me it sounded like a bad fan bearing, which I knew from my old e83 X3, so I suggested this and the SA agreed and they replaced the fan unit, but the noise is still there.

I know BMWs have a maintenance ""stigma"" attached, but was wondering if I go the CPO route, would I be ok getting a 2018 that is likely out of original warranty or should I shoot for 2019 or later that would still have at least a little factory warranty left (both would still have the CPO warranty though). 2018's open up the budget for an M40i, while 2019+ would likely be the 4-cyl.I've been stalking the BMW CPO website for a while, so I have an idea what's out there.

I know BMWs have a maintenance ""stigma"" attached, but was wondering if I go the CPO route, would I be ok getting a 2018 that is likely out of original warranty or should I shoot for 2019 or later that would still have at least a little factory warranty left (both would still have the CPO warranty though). 2018's open up the budget for an M40i, while 2019+ would likely be the 4-cyl.I've been stalking the BMW CPO website for a while, so I have an idea what's out there.

dal59,"Does your wife have an S or RS Audi? I always must have at least one performance vehicle within the household. If the Audi is a standard vehicle, I would go for the M40i. If the Audi is a performance model, then I would get the 4-cylinder X3. Obviously, no logic here, just personal preference.BTW - We have an Audi RS5, so when buying our new X3, I ""settled"" for the standard 4 cylinder. However, now that we have it, I do not feel like we settled at all. This 30i X3 moves along pretty darn good. But we still use the Audi to race the Hemi', 5.0' and others.","February 16, 2022"
brlabelle1972,"That's quite the analysis! The hybrid M40i's are out of my price range still, but good to know. The nice thing, from what I can tell, is that the M40i's don't seem to lose much MPG compared to the 30. Decisions, decisions...My biggest concern is that I don't want to buy something as-is; do y'all think that the CPO warranty is sufficient (1-year/Unl miles) or should I look for something with at least some factory warranty left?","February 17, 2022"
Autoputzer,"The reality is that it's rare for something to go wrong in that fifth year under CPO. Quality glitches tend to cause things to break before that, and things don't wear out until after that. BMW's can start being a PIA after about 70k miles.I'm fond of all the gadgets (HUD, cameras, parking SONAR, power lumbar support for both front seats, etc.). The later 30i's don't have those. Also, I'm militant about having a spare tire and a place to put it. The 2018's were the first year, and had some teething problems.","February 17, 2022"
SteveinArizona,"Autoputzer said:2018 was the first year of the G01. Frau Putzer's has had some problems: electric water pump, grill shutters, and a wiring short in the steering column causing an airbag fault warning message, and the black trim above the hatch window fading from black to blue. Our warranty expires in 27 days, and the black trim part is on order.I once thought that I'd never want a four-cylinder BMW. But, Frau Putzer's X3 30i changed my mind. Unless you enjoy racing Dodge Hemi's, Mustang GT's, and Z28's, the 30i's are sufficient and they get phenomenal fuel economy. The ""M"" in 'X3 M40i"" means the engine has been tweaked over an engine in a BMW with just a ""40i"" designation.If this is your first BMW in the last decade or so, you should be warned that most don't have a spare tire. That can be catastrophic on a weekend road trip, even with run-flats. The G01 does offer an optional spare. Try to find one that has it.Used car prices are crazy now, and used X3 prices even more so. Frau Putzer's X3 appreciated about $5k in 2021. X3's can be had for MSRP now. If you drive a lot of miles annually, it might be worth ordering a new one and getting exaclty what you want. But, they've cut a lot of the gadgets off the 30i's due to parts shortages.Click to expand...It is a good practice to NEVER purchase a car in the first year of production. Give the car maker a chance to resolve any issues by waiting to at least the second year.","February 17, 2022"
Closem Joe,You are correct Stevie boy!,"February 17, 2022"
Autoputzer,"Yeah, I've bought two of my four BMW's that way and they were both a PIA. No regrets, though. It was the cost of doing business.I was at the front of the two-year-long waiting list for E46 M3 coupes. My car only depreciated the cost of the sales tax in the first year. We balked at an F84 X1,F25 X3, and F15 X5 40e hybrid because of the lack of a spare tire. The G01's had them and Frau Putzer's 12.5-year-old, 147k-mile Honda was well overdue for replacement.","February 17, 2022"
dal59,"If your biggest concern is buying something ""as-is"", I would get the most amount of warranty possible. Repair costs on these cars can be VERY expensive. There is a lot of expensive parts in these babies. Turbo' and AWD differentials, just to mention a couple. Again, this is just me, but I never buy a used car. They can call it ""Certified Pre-Owned"", but in English, that means used, and who knows what the heck the previous owner(s) did to that thing.","February 17, 2022"
kevreh,"My wife got her X3 xDrive 30i last October and really likes it. With gas prices being high, if I had to do it over again we probably would have taken a look at the electrified X5. It costs more, but you also get around $7k in tax credits back, combining fed and state. Best part is for people driving around running errands less than 30 miles or so a day you won't use gas. Of course you have to factor the cost of a charging station. I first scoffed at the idea of a low kw battery and minimal miles, but kind of kicking myself for being so focused on ""bigger is better"" numbers. On road trips, you'll quickly run out of battery but OTOH you get much better gas mileage anyways.","June 22, 2022"
brlabelle1972,"I actually got a '19 in April. Loving it so far. It was kind of a ""perfect storm"" of a deal. Found one in Chicago for a good price, and got a killer value on my trade.

Closem Joe,"bocabimmer said:Just did the Performance Center experience this morning. They do a small course where you drive an X5 around off-road. It’s amazing what these cars can do (and never will).The next segment was driving an M4 comp, M8, and X4M around a small course they set up to compare the differences. It was just enough to get us wanting to do the full M school. Each driver got two laps per car. My wife was a little frustrated because she kept coming close to lapping the car in front of her so they had to slow her down a lot to keep the gaps. If there’s one thing I came away learning it’s the importance of hard braking in corners.Finally they give you a proper ride in an M3 around the full circuit and wet skid pad with the instructors. When he’s drifting almost completely sideways perfectly through a set of cones carrying on a conversation, I realized I can no longer call anything I have ever done in any car “drifting” anymore but simply an “intentional mild oversteer incident”.Bottom line: I’m hooked. I need to go back. I’d rather make the guy behind the wheel of my 30i more competent than adding more hp to the equation. And for public roads, I think I can do plenty clipping apexes and taking corners. Those M cars are awesome but I can’t help feeing I’d just end up frustrated knowing I can’t really use them to their full potential unless I’m on a track.Click to expand...You the man Boca Boy!

aztecnyc,"Hello forum buddies , I have a 2020 x3 with 30K , the Ultimate care + service coverage runs out in 6 k miles. Because of the obvious issues with getting new cars I am going to keep it for another year or 2. Today while in service, I was offered a BMW service plan for $1,699 to cover service to 50K . This only covers front/ rear brakes, engine oil,spark plugs microfilter, brake fluid, air filter, vehicle checks and I think wiper blades. I have mechanical coverage to 100k for the rest of the car through Geico but no service coverage. Any advise upon taking this extended service plan? Thank you always .","July 9, 2022"

Lotso72,"2020 BMW X3 - Within months of purchasing new I found that the car would junk/surge erratically when shifting. I have taken the car to the shop several times and they say they have heard of this issue, but with no codes there is no fix. They claim can't duplicate the issue even after taking it in with the problem frequently occurring.First time in shop car was 3 months and 4021 miles. My car has been in the shop 6 times in the first year and spent over a month there. I spoke to several service writers at BMW and they have had others complaining of the same problem but don't know what the problem is. I filed lemon law on the vehicle and took it in for a BMW engineer to review. They claim could not duplicate the problem but when picking up the car there is no added mileage or less than 4 miles driven.The last time in the shop was October 2021 the shop manager said until BMW comes out with a fix there is nothing they can do. He advised me not to continue to bring it to the shop for this issue.Has anyone else experienced this issue?","July 6, 2022"
Lotso72,I think the car has to be warmed up and it will start occurring anytime it shifts up or down of the first 2 shifts and sometime on the 3rd. It is more noticeable when starting from a complete stop. I tested in sport the results were the same but not as hard. I get what you are saying about a hesitation and it possibly not being in gear.

That's how the car bid'ness works. But, I love the optional seats in Frau Putzer's X3 30i with the four-way adjustable lumbar support (part of the Convenience Package). The seats are small, but small doesn't mean uncomfortable. BMW's rationing power lumbar support and is only putting them on the driver's seats in four-cylinder vehicles. That would stop me from buying a BMW now.The best airline seat I ever at in was in a Metroliner. The seats were rigid, tiny and didn't recline, but they had good lumbar support.","February 7, 2022"
Autoputzer,"Soft cushions are not necessarily a good thing. Firm ones hold your back in the proper shape. Soft cushions let your back deform as it wants to and that's not a good thing.I'm on the fence about my next BMW, either a 330i or a 530i. The 330i has firmer seat cushions and offers non-run-flat, all-season tires as a factory option, costs about $10k less, and gets about two more MPG's. The 530i's bigger, but it's still a two- or three-person car when I'm in it. When there's a third person in our car, we leave my 535i at home and take the X3.","February 7, 2022"

We do a lot of road trips and the seats sucked for me. Hurt my butt and my back. From test driving, the seats on the 22 seem about the same unfortunately. I've got a good air seat cushion I use in my truck ill use on road trips. Makes you sit higher though which throws everything else off. From a lot of reading, it seems the sensatech seats are better than the more expensive leather seats. I wish the luxury seating package was available on this.","February 7, 2022"
Deliberate1,"OP here. Thanks everyone for the honest info and assessments. Frankly, rather disappointing that the regular seats are not up to the rest of the vehicle. I mentioned above that I returned the '18 M40i that I tried because the ventilated seats were just intolerable. Not just uncomfortable, but caused some tingling in my legs (and it wasn't from speed). Well, I tolerated 160k miles with the mediocre seats in the '11 X3 35i that just left us. Maybe that will just continue into the next car.Is there a consensus as to the best seats in a BMW SUV?","February 7, 2022"
astrohip,"And that may be the reason. My last few BMWs, going back to the 1990s, were all 5 Series (525, 540, 550). The seats were incredible. They made your body feel integrated to the car.But I needed an SUV (road clearance), and the X5 was too big for me. And I loved the way the X3 drove and handled. It was only a few thousand miles down the road before I realized the seats were crap.","February 8, 2022"
Closem Joe,"Maybe the folks complaining about the seats might explore going to an auto upholstery guy and see what can be done about it to solve the problem.

Closem Joe,"dal59 said:Reading this thread again made me determined to find a comfortable position is this X3. Well, it may not be perfect, but I finally found the settings that have helped. I never found the seats to be uncomfortable, I just never felt I could get my posture right. I was always leaning forward to reach the steering wheel and I cannot move the seat up, as I need the legroom.This is going to sound silly, but being a bit on the taller side, I have always made lowering my seat all the way down as my first adjustment. However, I realized over the last few months, even though I have been playing with the seat adjustments, I never tried raising the seat. Well, it seems that raising the seat not only gets you sitting higher up, but also brings you a little closer to the steering wheel. I guess everyone else in the world knew that already.Anyway, getting a little closer to the steering wheel without having to move my seat forward, or sitting nearly vertical, was all I needed.Click to expand...Aren't you the smart one!👍👍👍","February 8, 2022"

My old 2007 X3 with the versatac leather were more comfortable for the long haul and my wife's 2019 Q7 ventilated seats positively blow any of the BMW seats away.

The question you need answered can only be answered by the dealer where you're ordering the new car. I've always been able to drive my trade-in until the new car arrived, but that was never more than 6 weeks.

bocabimmer,"Autoputzer said:Used car prices are falling fast. Both of our BMWs' (2014 535i, 2018 X3 30i) KBB values dropped about $3k in the first three months of 2022. They had little to no depreciation for 2020 and 2021. You could try finding a private buyer for your car. If you don't, you could shop around when selling your old car to a dealership (Carvana, Vroom, M-B dealerships, etc.) when your new one comes in. The conventional wisdom has always been to negotiate the new car purchase and the used car trade-in separately. If your M-B is still under warranty, it might be worth more to an M-B dealership, since they could CPO it and jack up the retail price some.We (almost) wear out our cars before we get rid of them (average of 9.6 years and 118k miles). But, I usually find buyers through networking (friends, coworkers). I have seven people waiting for my manual-transmission 535i, and three or four waiting for Frau Putzer's X3.The shortage of cars now has translated into a shortage of loaner cars at a lot of dealerships. I doubt your BMW dealership would give you a loaner until your new car comes in.Click to expand...Funny, I just sold my F30 330i today for just about what I paid for it a year ago.

bocabimmer,"astrohip said:First, I'm not aware that BMW offers a different configuration/option for the rear bench. They could, I'm just not aware of it.Assuming they don't, you can seat three across, as it's a bench. But it's a small, and not too comfortable. It would be okay for a short ride (back & forth to school, etc), but not for a real drive. It's on the hump, and just not designed for long-term comfort.I also don't think you can put three car seats back there. It has the tie-downs for a car seat on each side, but not in the middle (again, I'm not sure, but I've never seen them).Good luck!Click to expand...By configuration, I mean of the car seats (forward/rear facing, convertible/booster/infant seat). There are endless possibilities with them and what you put where can make a huge difference.LATCH points don’t matter. Most seats have belt path options. I’m in the car seat rental business, I don’t have a single seat in my inventory that can’t. What’s a bigger issue is if the middle seat can accommodate a car seat when there’s two other ones on the outer seats.Once again, that depends a lot on the car seats and how you use them.","May 7, 2022"

Doug Huffman,Which “car tire sensor?”. TPMS is independent of the tire being mounted on the wheel.,"April 24, 2022"
mwhayden,"Autoputzer said:I've gone through 18 Michelin high-performance tires, and twelve Continentals including a set of DWS06's. The Michelins wear evenly with less pressure than the Continentals. I'd go with the Michelin PS A/S 4's as my first choice. My second choice would be the Bridgestone Potenzas. Both of these tires have an ""AA"" traction rating which measures wet traction of a tire.All those tires are non-run-flats. They'll ride better than run-flats. Hopefully, your X3 has the optional spare tire.Bridgestone also has the Dueler H/T Sport AS in that size. That's what came on Frau Putzer's 2018 X3 30i. They're an ""touring"" tire, which is a nice way of saying low-performance. The one advantage they have over the other tires is that they're symmetric. There's no inside our outside sidewall. After 35k miles, Frau Putzer's tires had an average of 0.5/32"" more wear in the outside circumferential than in the inside channel. So, for $219, I had them flipped on the wheels and rebalanced. That will get her at least an extra 10k miles out of the tires, for a total of somewhere between 60k and 70k miles.. I make an effort to drive the X3 instead of my 535i as much as possible, so that the X3's tires will wear out before they age out (six years).The Bridgestone Dueler H/T Sport AS's are available in both run-flat and non-run flat. Frau Putzer's X3 has the non-run-flat version.I suspect the Pirelli P7's on your X3 are run-flats. It doesn't look like Pirelli makes a non-run-flat P7 tire in that size.Tire rotation is not part of required maintenance. But doing so will extend the life of your tires, and will benefit the transfer case clutches if you have xDrive. Even with xDrive, the correct rotation pattern is the RWD one:LF > RR > RF > LR > LFThat's because most of the power (60%) still goes to the rear axle.Click to expand...I rotate my tires every oil change at 7500 miles. I consistently get 60K-70K from my tires.","April 24, 2022"

Even then, the 245's have a lower load rating (99) than the 275's (103).It'd be cheaper to just stay with the staggered sized and accept that you might have to replace the back tires twice for every time you replace the front tires.","November 27, 2021"

Autoputzer,"When dealing with car dealerships, if their lips are moving, assume they're lying. The spare and raised trunk floor is a $150 option on G01's and is standard equipment on X3M's and X4M's.

But, it'd be about ten times what it costs as a factory option:RealOEM.com - Online BMW Parts CatalogCall one of the on-line BMW parts retailers and they'd probably help you with the parts list.

gphin305,So a flash tune appears to be not an option but what about a piggyback like JB4 or Racechip? Lots of discussions on other forums but mostly focusing on the B58 motor. Was hoping to find some feedback from 30i owners but doesn't appear to be much available. .,"April 3, 2022"

gphin305,Still doing research and came across thisBad News for the Tuning Community?Appears the ECUs were not locked until 2020? Any ideas for determining/confirming if mine is locked or not? Would prefer a flash as opposed to a piggyback. Thanks.,"April 10, 2022"
HotGrbg,It’s not just a matter of production date. They were “open” until about mid 2020 but BMW has locked most of them through software updates. Any vehicle that was programmed since late 2020 OR produced since the cut off date is now locked.,"April 10, 2022"
gphin305,So it sounds like mine may or may not be locked. Have only had vehicle in for two oil changes since mid 2020 and really can't remember if they did a software update or not. Guess I need to take to a local Bootmod3 installer to find out? Or do you have a recommendation to go with JB4 or Racechip instead. Any experience? Thanks again.,"April 10, 2022"
HotGrbg,I can’t recommend any tuning or software. I don’t know much about it and have chosen to personally keep my warranty intact for the time being,"April 10, 2022"
mtbrdad,"What does a tune really get you in horsepower 5 or maybe 10 hp? I was with a guy in a 2019 porsche macan the other who had a stage 2 tune and we were following a 2020 audi Q5 both of which had the audi 2.0 turbo and he absolutely could not pass him on at least short .5-1 mile stretches of road. A stock m40i would have passed either. As I've told my kids ""don't waste money trying to make a car fast, just save and buy a faster car"".","April 11, 2022"
gphin305,"Update for anyone interested: Decided to buy a Racechip last week during their sale. Went with Racechip over JB4 because of simpler install....just two connectors and no wires thru firewall or thru door jam. Had a little trouble disconnecting the first sensor but otherwise very simply install. Several modes to choose from. I've only driven in ""mid"" Sport mode so far. Have no idea how much additional HP but it's very noticeable, and to me well worth the price. Simple to disconnect when taking into dealer. So far, so good, and well worth the price. FYI,","April 26, 2022"
HotGrbg,"This means nothing and you might as well leave it in. You DME has already reported FC S077. There is no hiding piggy backs and flashes any longer. Checksum error monitoring, flash counters and tattletale log data has already been permanently stored. There’s nothing wrong with tuning your vehicle as it’s yours and it’s your right but BMW is now hip to the game of break it and claim it under warranty.","April 26, 2022"
gphin305,"Thanks for feedback. It will be interesting to see any dealer response when I take in for next oil change. I don't plan on disconnecting anyway. I had a flashed VW for eight years with 115k and never a problem and dealer could have cared less. In fact they eventually became a APR dealer. My only experience with flashing was an enjoyable one so I'm good with this choice since the driving experience is so much better and I drive my vehicles pretty easy. Again, appreciate the feedback.","April 26, 2022"
gphin305,HotGrbg said:They won’t say anything during an oil change. They probably won’t say much for the basic issues common G01 issues but they could. If something fails like a turbo or goofy oxygen sensor or boost pressure faults then they will probably raise red flags.BMW has explicitly stated they do not want any engine modifications and have even stopped supporting Dinan which was a long time known tuner in the BMW world. In the old days BMW didn’t like Dinan tuned cars but really didn’t make a stink about them. Dinan would pick up the balance of factory warranty if anything occurred. Now BMW wants nothing to do with any tuners and Dinan has been sold off. BMW has released multiple bulletins about software identification and dealers no longer have ANY SAY about a covered component. If a vehicle has a problem and is piggy backed or tuned then a tech is required to submit a “repair clearing” case through PUMA and BMW now decided what’s covered and what’s not.Click to expand...Good to know. Wondered what happened to Dinan. Thanks for info.,"April 26, 2022"

HotGrbg,G cars set faults like crazy but are not necessarily indicative of a problem. You should see shadow memory! Literally hundreds of faults. I’m not sure I’d worry about much IF your not having any issues. It would be nice to see fault frequency as you may have an issue with left headlight but if these are one time faults then I donno if I’d concern myself with them. The microphone needs calibrated and is a permanent fault so the frequency will be “-1 or 255 or unknown” but the BDC window faults are a total quick clear. I’m not sure service/BMW will do anything with these faults unless your experiencing a problem.How did you get these faults? The BMW portal?? Never seen this.,"April 24, 2022"

The black expansion tank is the expansion tank for the low temperature coolant circuit.The TIS is full of prerequisites, precautions, cautions and requirements.Gas bubbles may develop in more elevated areas of the coolant circuit, such as at the cylinder head, as a result of the loss of pressure. Sufficient heat dissipation can no longer be guaranteed in these areas. Overheating would be the consequence.Before starting the automatic cooling system bleeding routine, make sure that both coolant circuits are filled. The cooling system bleeding routine is automatically started simultaneously for both coolant circuits. If the cooling system bleeding routine is started while one of the coolant circuits is empty, there is a risk of damage to the electric coolant pump when running it dry.Make sure that terminal 15 is not disconnected for the bleeding procedure. Switch on low-beam headlights and hazard warning lights. If the low-beam headlights and hazard warning lights are not switched on, the ignition (terminal 15) will switch off automatically after a certain period of time and interrupt the bleeding procedure.TECHNICAL INFORMATIONFilling without the vacuum filler device (watering can filling) is not permitted.Non-compliance will result in danger of component damage and/or engine damage.Filling specification absolutely must be adhered to.The operation of the vehicle is not permitted unless the filling procedure has been completed. Otherwise, functional limitations (degradation) and/or overheating may occur.A bleeding procedure is required after a part has been exchanged in the cooling system and/or after refilling the cooling system.Click to expand...Are there different types of coolant for each reservoir (white(bigger) + black)?I have BMW G01 2018.

When cars sit on the dealer lots they have approximately 50 to 60 psi of air pressure in the tires, this is to prevent flat spots. Part of a correct dealer prep cycle is to make sure the tires have the correct air pressure and that the gage in the car is set correctly, I’ve seen many times when this has never happened and the tire still have 50 to 60 psi in them at delivery. Also, many BMW owners lower the air pressure at least 1 psi to soften the ride and yes this does make a difference.","March 27, 2022"

mtbrdad,"rick47591 said:Prior to ordering my 2021 X3M40i, I had heard rumors about tire sizes and top speed. So I asked BMW's Genius at their factory and they told me if I got 19"" all weather tires, my top speed would be 130mph. Then they told me if I got either the 20"" or the 21"" tires, then my top speed would be 155mph. So I ordered my M40i with 20"" tires. I was told to stay away from the 21"" tires due to them being more low profile which has a greater tendency to blowout when driving over chuck-holes.My 20"" tires are staggered and I was told that the staggered setup gives increased handling. I was also told I would not notice the ruts in the roads so much. Since receiving my M40i, ruts on highways do not bother me anymore.This past summer while vacationing out west in states that have the increased speed limit of 80mph, I can tell you this much...my M40i was able to attain 155mph.Click to expand...My 2018 m40i with the standard 19"" rims with the OEM Pirelli run flat summer tires it came with has gone well over 130mph.","March 9, 2022"
Autoputzer,"There were two choices in 19"" wheels on the 2018 X3 M40i: ""all-season"" (low performance) or ""performance"" (summer) run flat tires. The all-season tires probably only had an H speed rating, where the ""performance"" tires had a V or higher speed rating. The higher speed rating for the tires would get you the 155 MPH top speed limiter setting (Option Code 840)..A square set-up and performance tires is something you can't get on BMW passenger cars. I finally got that on my 535i after replacing the OE tires.

I also opted for the trailer hitch option and don't regret it. I infrequently miss the hands-free trunk operation that you lose with the hitch and frankly the hitch adds a lot more versatility to the car2- Good call on the space saver, it will give you the option of switching to softer non RFT in the future3- Tinting: I personally live in PA so less hot than TX, but I personally prefer the look of the tinted back windows only. I also find the rear side shades to add a lot to privacy and look of the car. I can't attest to how sturdy they are but do not appear flimsy.4- Haven't compared the 19 to 20 wheels back to back, but I also researched this extensively before I bought mine and opted for the 19 for comfort and availability of All Season RFTs.

Z4530i,"JamesColo said:@AutoputzerThanks so much for your response. The used car is in really good condition and it's coming from a friend so I'm not too worried about any issues incurred by its previous use, the only reason they're selling it is because they want to go electric and have a bit too much money to spend. I'd probably plan on keeping the car until the 5-year guarantee runs out, after that, I'd sell it or trade-in for a new model depending on what's on the market at the time. I'm guessing after 5 years the difference between the 2021 and 2022 will be between $1250-2500.You're totally right about the spare tire, I didn't check for that but I should, where I live it's quite remote so getting flat would be a real nightmare even with the run-flat tires. This could be a real deal-breaker now that I think about it. I'm also not a fan of the colors on the 2021 I've been offered and I just love the facelift that 2022 has been given.If the 2021 doesn't have the spare tire and given the potential loss in resale, the gap could be closer to $6500 instead of $10,000.Click to expand...You could offer them less. Keep in mind, that in most states (definitely not California), a trade in reduces the amount of sales tax paid. As an example, if you’re trading in a $35,000 car, in a 7% sales tax state, that’s $2,350 sales tax not charged. Yes, there are exceptions and various other rules which may apply, but you get the concept. So, your friends may not have room to budge. You also loose warranty sooner (than if you bought new).

The latter two conditions make it hard to finance the purchase of those cars.Down 15% from the book value in the remaining years.SUV's, pick-up trucks, and economy cars do a little better than the rule of thumb. Luxury cars do a little worse.Here's what the depreciation of a $60k MSRP BMW would look like using the rule of thumb and a four-year factory warranty.

Near wear the jacking points are, but at the very end of the body closest to the tires. The front and rear measured the same height on both left and right sides. I suppose I expected it to be just a bit higher in the rear to allow for when cargo is placed in the rear. Not like a pickup truck, but at least a little.Last, the gap between the wheel wells and the top of tires is higher in the front than it is in the rear.

This data is given in road tests of vehicles in car magazines (Car and Driver, Road & Track, Motor Trend, etc.).Here's the first catch. Weight put behind the rear axle will actually amplify the weight placed on the rear axle. It will also remove some weight from the front axle. You'd have to do a weight and balance calculation to determine the maximum weight you can carry in the cargo area. (I might mess with this tomorrow.)The second catch is that you have to worry about damaging the removable floor of the cargo area, particularly if you have a hybrid or have a spare tire. The way to mitigate this risk is to cut a piece of plywood about the size of the cargo area floor. That will spread the weight of the cargo more evenly over the removable floor.Click to expand...Yes, I had taken care of the ""cardboard"" floor in the cargo area and was just wondering about the weight.

The spare is standard on an X3M.The 19"" tires are ""all-season"" tires. That's code for ""low-performance."" Frau Putzer's has them on her X3 30i.

She says every time she passes someone on the expressway by moving into the next lane it accelerates so fast she needs to jam on the brakes to stop from hitting the car in the lane she just moved into, there's nothing smooth about it.

That being said a ground strap is cheap and starting to be a common issue with F25 that hasn’t quite made its way to the forum yet. Other vehicles had ground strap issues in the past but F25 starts getting really odd when this strap corrodes with random issues, starting and MSA problems and check engine lights.I would make a cutoff point if it were me. Decide what amount of money is comfortable to try and address the issue.On the flip side of the coin the G01 and B46 is vastly superior to F25.

We had one minor software-related issue that our dealer corrected with an update. The engine (B46) and transmission work well together. The interior is quiet, feels premium, and has lots of tech. Given the age and issues you're having with yours, it may be time to upgrade. Or consider a brand that causes less headache?

Autoputzer,"LogicalApex said:This is a rough time to be buying a car, any car used new it doesn't matter, but at the same time we don't know if or when the market will be back to how it used to look. So, if you need to buy then you need to buy. It is what it is...I'm also on my first BMW and I'm fairly happy with the car. Have had it for 2 years now and it still keeps a smile on my face. So far, the ""costs"" of dealing with the car have all been a lot lower than my Mercedes I sold before buying the BMW so both me and the better half are happy!Financial decisions are complex, but in this market I would say put down as little as you're comfortable with monthly payment wise. Get a loan term that is reasonably long, like 5 years, depending on interest rates for you. Invest the rest of the downpayment and enjoy the cheaper TCO as a result. Car prices are up like crazy so you can likely skip GAP insurance too as I doubt there is going to be a gap (or much of one) and since you're well capitalized anyway it won't matter. If you just can't stand having a payment though then you can approach it differently, of course.Personally, I'm not a fan of leasing. I've never done it and I just don't really like the concept all that much. It is a longterm rental so you'll end up perpetually paying the depreciation curve on new cars which is where the money really is lost on car purchases. IMHO, buy it and sell it or trade it when you're done and you'll end up better off with less ""hassle"" unless you really want to be on that treadmill.Reliability and maintenance wise will depend a fair bit on your preferences. If you prefer to go to the dealer for all your work like I do then it is likely a better deal to get an extended warranty and extended maintenance plan depending on how long you plan to keep the vehicle. I skipped this on my Mercedes and I noticed that maintenance costs went up at dealers after the new car warranty expires. I expected the same for BMW so extended my maintenance but I will own for 7Y and hope to put least 100K by then.Let's not forget the span that driver was dealing with was 300 miles...I wouldn't drive 300 miles on a donut spare... If you get a blowout on that donut spare you're back at square 1.RFT are more resistant to blowouts and you're more likely to encounter a slow leak that you can nurse along until you get to your destination if you have a pump in your trunk..I'm very happy with RFTs and I've down over 22K miles on mine... I enjoy doing overnight 1K mile+ drives too so very risky from that perspective, but I don't bat an eye...Click to expand...There's no specific mileage limit on donut spares.

I started looking for a new vehicle and went big to an M3 Competition. It had all the toys you could get and was absolutely a rocket.The thing was that I drive about as much as you do and so most of the time it just sat and depreciated. I also found myself missing the unique characteristics of the 1. Don't get me wrong, the 2, especially the M2 is a worthy successor, but it just wasn't the same.So, I never really bonded with the M3 and once I moved to a place where I almost exclusively drove on city streets it was an absolute waste. So, as fun as the mM40i would be, I'd probably stick with Ol' Reliable and put a few bucks in to fix the charger and maybe look at some sort of aftermarket solution to getting you as close to CarPlay as you can. It really is wonderous to not have a car payment.I do agree that CarPlay is really great. I've since moved on from the M3 to a 2020 X3e and drive almost exclusively on battery (now that they fixed the batteries via a lengthy recall process).

Mine opens because I carry the keys in my pocket. It opened once while in drive and stopped at a traffic light. I hadn't figured out that the driver door hatch switch will close it if you hold it up for a few seconds. I had to find a way off the road so I could stop, get out and close the hatch. It's getting annoying to go outside on my way to work and see the hatch open. I've also been shopping at the mall, came out and there it is, wide open. Fortunately nothing has been stolen yet but it's only a matter of time. Is anyone aware of a way to disable the key fob button for opening the hatch? I have no where else to carry my keys. I've checked the vehicle settings but found no way to isolate the rear hatch from the key fob button. VERY annoyed with this!Click to expand...If you purchase the BMW key fob case, using it, you'll be able to prevent the buttons on the fob from being depressed while in your pocket. (This is based on my own experience.)However, I think you'll find that the problem is not being caused (for the most part) due to the buttons on the fob being depressed. The issue is with the optical sensor - which BMW has acknowledged is hyper sensitive. I believe there is a fix for it...","March 28, 2018"
brown9335,"Thanks RidinDirty. I had read the service bulletin and I'm more convinced in my case that it's the button being unintentionally depressed while in my pocket rather than an over sensitive smart opener sensor. There's nothing behind my car in my driveway and possibly cars going by too close in a mall parking lot with me now where near shouldn't cause it to open. I suppose a key fob case is the answer to my issue. I've had Z4's, 230s, M240 and a 440 without having this issue. I think I will take it over to the performance center and let them change out the smart opener sensor since it costs me nothing other than time out of my day. As we say in the south; thanks y'all.","March 28, 2018"
SpeedyK,"If you are referring to the hands free operation, the tail gate sensor only work if the fob is close by like less than 1-2 feet. I have verified that if you placed the fob in the rear passenger seat, and then go outside to wave your feet below the rear bumper, the tail gate won't open. So, in most cases, the tail gate open is because the fob was unintentionally depressed by an object. Now, I removed all my other keys to a different key chain and leave the fob alone, and put them in separate pockets. Since then, I never experience the problem again. Hope this will help.","March 29, 2018"

BURNMAN,Purchasing a 2019 X3 and I want to put a trailer hitch with wiring. What's my best options? I would like to use a plug and play harness vs splicing wires but can't seem to find anything. What's my best option.,"December 8, 2021"
mr_bean,"I would recommend the Tekonsha ZCI controller. It doesn't splice into the wires, instead it has a current sensors that wrap around the wires and essentially leaves the factory wiring untouched. I have one on my E82.","December 8, 2021"

mr_bean,"Curt. I had limited options for the E82.They seem to be a reputable company from what I read online. However, I did have a minor issue with the fit-up. The muffler bracket rattled against the hitch - I had read some reviews specific to the E82 model that mentioned this so it's not an isolated incident.

Glen E,"I would believe it, mostly because of the way the warranty system works. A dealer wants to do as much warranty work as possible because it’s a direct reimbursement from Bmw. Therefore there’s no vested interest for him to not want to change the plugs, except if he can’t get paid for the new plugs. And if the new service schedule is 60 K, then he can’t get paid for it. So I believe it…..call bmw and ask…..","October 27, 2021"
ard,"So your maintenance book states for YOUR car it should be done?Or it does for the X4, which is not your car.... your car being the X3.IMO,(assuming the above is wrong and YOUR model is listed with a 30k change) legally, BMW cannot retroactively change this without notice.

If a soft, spongy ride is what you are looking for, you bought the wrong car, you need a Cadillac! Like I posted earlier, I am very happy with the ride. If you live on a gravel road or constantly drive on poorly constructed or maintained roads, yes, the ride will seem harsher because the suspension is firmer and will provide a ride accordingly.

My luck ran out on the return leg, and my MPG for the round-trip was ""only""37.6.In addition to hyper-mile-ing and using EcoPro, my other ""tricks"" are that I ordered the X3 with non-run-flat tires. That boosts the MPG by about one percent. I've also adjusted the tire pressures to achieve even tire wear, going from the door jamb decal recommended 32 PSI front and 35 PSI rear to 39 PSI front and rear. That also improves MPG in addition to making the tires last longer (60k+ miles in this case).If you goosed run-flats to 10% to 20% over what the door jamb decal says, what you saved on replacing tires you'd spend on replacing dental fillings.View attachment 1041274Click to expand...Oh, your funny Putz!","September 21, 2021"

dal59,"HotGrbg said:The front diff is a normal open differential. The rear however is a motor actuated limited slip with clutches ( GHAS ). BMW considers the rear to be a Motorsport differential. On ///M cars during the 1200 mile service they get rear diff serviced. Back in the old days BMW used to do 1200 mile break in services on all cars but somewhere along the way decided they didn’t want to pay for every cars break in. I personally think it’s fine NOT to do the break in services if you don’t want to except in the case of the GHAS diff if your keeping the car long term. Again BMW will not pay for this but my personal experience and peace of mind says it should be done. If it were my car as well I would do a 1200 mile oil change too. Again at your expense but I posted my break in oil service using blackstone report on the thread “requesting B46 blackstone oil reports” which showed high wear metals as expected. If you do decide to change the oil make sure you buy the liter bottles as who knows what some dealers are using in the bulk. It SHOULD be the same but isn’t always the case. The new BMW Twin Power Turbo oil is Castrol 0W20 and carries an API-SP rating which I also posted showing the TAN/TBN readings and makeup on the oil on that same thread. While I’m not fully sold on the 0/20 oils yet I don’t have any hard data to contradict using it yet.I have been promoting the new B46 and B58 since they made it to the BMW side and they are rock solid so far as long as your using premium fuel to combat LSPI and good oil.Requesting B46 engine Blackstone lab reportsI was hoping for a place for people to post B46 engine blackstone reports.

dal59,"HotGrbg said:All dealers use bulk oil and normally it’s the same stuff but not always. Another prominent member found out his local dealer uses something else. My dealer uses castrol but I’d say don’t take chances. You can either buy the liter bottles over the parts counter and put them in the car ( thus avoiding any potential service markup ) or ask them to use the liter bottles and not the bulk oil.The GHAS G4 fluid is pricey! It’s over 50$ for .500ml but luckily you only need 2 bottles ( 1000ml ). Then youllProbably have to pay labor as well. The other fluids at 5k seems excessive but that’s totally your call if you don’t mind spending the cash. I’d say every 25-50k is more than adequate considering BMW considers all these fluids “lifetime” anyways.Click to expand...Wonderful. Again, I thank you for the info.

I also understand that model I bought has some sort of inferior/incomplete idrive version. I logged onto the my bmw app and my current software is up to date. I only have remote ventilation as an option, as that doesn't do me any good heading into winter. I have read that a full blown / fully functional idrive version permitting remote start is impossible to have for the SP15 which my x3 has. This has probably been asked before but I couldn't find anything definitive in this particular forum. Am I screwed with this short of installing an aftermarket remote start, which then could void the warranty? TIA for any insight!Click to expand...Sorry, I'm clueless on that one.

If not, why would BMW list a lower than possible MPG?I've been using 89 octane in our '22 X3 with 1500 miles. Is that acceptible? What would happen if we used 87 octane?","November 17, 2021"
kevreh,"Autoputzer said:The EPA requires manufacturers to do the emission and fuel economy test using whatever the default mode is when the car is started up. For BMW's that's ""Comfort Mode."" BMW would have better EPA numbers if they used EcoPro. but they'd have to make EcoPro Mode the default mode. People test driving a BMW in EcoPro Mode would say ""This car/SUV is a pig, let's go look at a Mercedes or Audi."" So, BMW takes a hit on EPA MPG estimates and uses Comfort Mode for the test.The displayed MPG can be off by five percent either way. There's a way to adjust them, but you have to know what to adjust it too. To do that, you have to compare your computer MPG to your ""gas pump"" MPG. Newer BMW's have a ""Since Refueling"" MPG. I reset my Onboard Computer MPG at each fill up, and can track the computer MPG error.My port-injected E46 M3's displayed MPG was consistently 5% low. With our direct-injected BMW's (F10 535i and G01 X3) the displayed MPG slowly drifts higher. Isuspectthis is because of the efficiency of the high-pressure fuel pump slowly diminishing over time. The error will vary from gas pump to gas pump. But, my recent average of error on the X3 is about 1% after adjustment. For my 535i, it's less than 0.5% after adjustment.The worst case scenario of using 89 AKI or 91 AKI is the engine blowing up. The ""LSPI"" edycol referred to is ""low speed pre-ignition,"" or ""super knock."" There's a bunch of stuff on the Interwebs about this. BMW's actually do an internal AKI test after you refuel, and record that data. If your engine blows up and you've been using 87 AKI, BMW could say it was your fault.The engine may also de-tune itself if you're using 89 AKI. BMW recommends 91 AKI to get all the performance (power, torque, fuel economy) advertised.If you live in an area where your gasoline choices are 87 AK, 89 AKI, and 93 AKI, you can make your own BMW-recommended 91 AKI by using 2/3's 93 AKI and 1/3 87 AKI. This will save you about $4/tank and about $1000 over 100k miles. Knowing my displayed MPG error, and resetting the trip odometer and Onboard Computer MPG when I fill-up, my estimate of how much gas I'll need at the next fill-up is usually within 0.2 gallons. I put in the 93 AKI first, to make sure the engine doesn't get lower AKI fuel before it's well mixed in the tank. It also gets me all the 93 AKI I paid for, leaving only 87 AKI in the gas pump hose for the next guy.Click to expand...I like that, not a bad idea. For most pumps if you switch gas is it a seperate credit card transaction? Is there any harm in doing the same but tank-to-tank using 89 AKI as the lowest octane (tank 1: 89 AKI, tank 2: 93 AKI)? Or will that mess with the computer.","November 17, 2021"
Closem Joe,"Kev, I think tank to tank is a mistake. If you're going to mix do it in the same tank of gas. We buy at Costco and they don't have 91 octane only 87 and 93 octanes, so we use 93 in both our our Bimmers. It's no big deal because we only put about 5,000 miles a year on each of them and they run like tops! 😁 Plus, since we all can afford Bimmers, we can afford the few extra bucks!

Many times while playing around with these re-builds, I would see that certain options no longer showed as available. My point is, that it seems to me that BMW keeps their site very up to date on what options are, and are not available. If it is a standard option, then you have to see if item(s) have been deleted. I.E. Ambient Lighting is a standard option, so you have to look to see if they have automatically deleted that from your build.

When buying the car I was given a disclosure which stated that car was a part of 'Driving Program' and it is not eligible for CPO or Extended warranty.

ard,"Two threads same issue..... here is my input from the other.ard said:If they will not allow it to be CPOd or Extended warranty it is ALMOST CERTAINLY a 'performance event'.,,or something that might impact the expected lifetime reliability of the car.But...even more importantly, instead of arguing about 'what is a program car'.... if BMW isnt willing to warranty it, why would you buy it?!!? That's nuts.Agree w Glen that 326 miles is low. HOWEVER, (since glen was a BMW GM) what 'local event' could possibly result in BMWNA reaching down to the local dealer level and limiting a future warranty??????IMO the 'event' was at BMWNA level (not 'local dealer') and had to be a significant use, such that long term reliability was impacted.Heck, BMW used to let golf pros trash cars and they still sold them without program restrictions, no???Did they lose a golf loner for 3 years?!?? And didnt change oil or fluid, and thats why no warranty? Are they willing to share service history? If it never got the required oil changes (yearly?) BMWNA could in fact deny ANY warranty coverage. (If they disagree, ask for this in writing. They wont.)and finally... I dont like to tell folks happy talk about how its no big dea...or how BMW programs might work...or how many cars are sold like this and are fine.

I had a couple things happening, the first was the aux power was timing out and shutting down before I was able to complete the process, which I finally solved by starting the car. The instructions in the BMW supplied manual for the X3 are somewhat generic, and don't necessarily apply to all openers. I accessed the manufacturer website for my opener and followed their instructions for programming the Homelink. The Homelink website may also have instructions for your brand of opener. I was finally able to get it working. One of the most frustrating things I experienced with our new X3.","June 5, 2018"

Mike02z,Hi guys.I just picked up a 22 X3 M40i and I love it. I've got everything working except mobile data. I connect to the wireless in the car then open a browser and openwww.bmwusa.com. It's then supposed to allow me to create an account for mobile data. This is not working on 3 different phones with no luck. I called support and they transferred me multiple times and disconnected me. One rep said I had to get in touch with my dealer because my car is not hotspot capable. Not sure why the car has wireless if it does not have mobile data.

There are plugs that ""piggyback"" into the tail light plugs, and the vehicles harness plugs into it. (These are hard to find for BMWs for some reason)or2.

Annihilator,"Fuel in the oil is normal. Especially if this is a forced induction car. You get blow by at the piston rings. Gasoline is very thin so it gets by, while the oil is thick so it doesn't. The only thing you can possibly do to reduce the fuel dilution (2.5% isn't that bad) is stop idling, stop warming up your car, and change your oil more often. Actually, you can also try to keep cylinder pressures up when you drive. Anytime you aren't loading the motor that creates the situation needed for the blowby. Pressure seals the rings. Thats why fuel blowby is worse in a forced induction car, because low compression = less cylinder pressure = more blowby when no load on the motor. Thats also why its bad at idle.

JeroM3,"Fuel dilution is typical in direct injected cars due to the injection pressures and the fact that fuel is sprayed directly into and on top of the cylinder. It is especially bad when the car is cold when the car has to richen the mixture and cold fuel not atomizing very wel . Cars that are driven on really short commutes tend to show fuel dilution because the oil isn’t run to hot enough temperatures to cause fuel and moisture to evaporate from the oil. Doing a lot of short drives, especially before taking the oil sample might cause this value to go up. Even a quick start to move the car into the garage to take the sample when the engine is cold will put fuel into the oil.","August 29, 2021"

HotGrbg,While I agree that these long oil services are insane a TAN/TBN blackstone would tell you how the oil additives are holding up. While the oil still may have “life left” the dirt/silicone/fuel/insolubles will still be there and may not be accurate in determining if you should do an oil change if you JUST go by TBN numbers. Luckily they provide you with all sorts of element numbers present so you can make a data driven decision about oil intervals.also FYI I started another thread that the goal is collecting several/many blackstone reports on B46 so feel free to read through that or add your own report!,"August 31, 2021"

However, I noticed something strange this morning. After driving in ECO PRO mode for a couple of minutes, I noticed the car reverted to Comfort mode by itself. I pushed the ECO pro button again. It would stay in that mode for a minute and then automatically change to Comfort mode and stay there. I repeated this (pushing ECO pro button) a couple more times, and the same thing happened. Does this car have some kind of over-ride mechanism built in to switch out of ECO pRO mode and under what condition does this mechanism kick in?

MSL92,"I bought my car used with 21"" wheels and was unaware that they don't make winter/AS tires in this size. I'm looking to replace the wheels/tires with 19s which should allow me to go with All Seasons, rather than swapping out every winter and spring. Does anyone have recommendations for RF tires that balance dry weather performance and decent winter grip? I remember seeing recos for the Michelin Pilot AS 4 and am hoping those will fit my car. Any thoughts on wheels, OEM vs custom brands?In the end, depending on how well the AS's perform, I may keep the 21s (who doesn't love going 120+ mph down an empty highway??!!)

BMW Technology across all platforms, especially new platforms, cost a lot to hire and keep, so these techs can be counted on one hand, and have a high turn over rate...another dealer will steal them for higher pay5. BMW repair follows a strict process until it ties up a bay too long, then it's ""get it out of here""6. Quality of repair is based on the Tech's experience and their personal decision to ensure quality over volume..this is a personal decision, because the Dealership pushes speed and volume7. Dealerships keep and reward only those that support volume/speed and do not base performance on quantity of ""fixing it right""8. Service Advisers (SAs) have an assigned team (crew) and the top SA gets the top tech's, while the other SA's have to made due with less qualitied techs ...remember the SA's get rewarded based on volume, not on quantities of ""right""9.

HotGrbg,True,"May 30, 2021"
Closem Joe,"HotGrbg said:In my world1-agree the quality of dealerships service departments is not the same across the board.2- the quality of work at a single dealership over time is consistent. BMW constantly pushes training and criteria for maintaining a certain tech level. This past year BMW has now decided in order for techs to maintain “master” status then they now have to be A1-A8 ASE certified as well.3- dealership service is about volume but it’s certainly not maintenance. Maintenance pays very little especially with dealers opting into the “value service program”. The volume comes from upselling repairs and volume of vehicles in the door. Most dealerships now are OVER 50% warranty ratio. In fact it’s closer to 70% in some shops hence the implementation of value service programs. In fact overseas BMW techs are not flat rate, it’s only an American thing and BMW does frequent jabs to try and kill the system including lowering FRU rates on jobs. Dealerships do reward quality techs by giving some hours to certain techs to help them achieve the set goal weekly.4-BMW techs do cost a lot to hire and maintain but there is not much turn over rate. It’s in a dealers best interest to keep qualified level 1 techs as dealers have CORA requirements to meet by BMW. If they do not fulfill their CORA requirements they lose out on huge bonuses given by BMW. Tech level is just 1 of several requirements to get these bonuses.5-BMW repairs are strictly followed via repair instructions. A tech is usually flat rate but I can assure you he finished the job until it’s complete correctly regardless of time as he knows there’s many consequences in not following repair instructions including but not limited to bounced claims, come backs, loss of CSI bonus, and potentially loss of his career.I’m not saying all techs are created equal but your blanket statement is flat out wrong.6-a techs quality is a personal decision but it’s one that any seasoned tech is proud of. Mistakes happen to everybody but the techs with poor quality over time do not last.7-dealerships do reward quality driven techs as it keep come back numbers in check and a happier customer base. Team leaders, shop foreman and service dispatchers are techs that have been rewarded based on performance over many years not how many brake jobs they can complete in a week. Team leaders/foreman/etc are normally seasoned techs that have proven they can complete complicated repairs without issue and have a wide array of knowledge to assist level 2-3 techs with repairs.8-some shops work by teams and some do not. If you are on a team based system each SA gets a master tech or level 1 tech and they balance teams by several factors including a few diag techs and a few burners. One team turning 70+ hours average a week and one team doing 35 doesn’t make business sense and will run all the other advisors out of the door pretty quickly.9-I agree here. Not all dealerships are created equal and if you have a shitty service experience you should go somewhere else until you feel your getting the service your paying big money for.10-cheapest usually does mean quality is second priority however most bmw dealerships now price match on repairs, price match tires and implement new programs such as the “value service” previously mentioned. It’s important to do your homework and call around for pricing but don’t automatically write off dealerships.11-profit does win but not by sacrificing quality. Profit is a long term goal and by losing a little here or there on a customer the dealer is building a relationship for that customer to buy more cars in the future and return for service work creating a sustained profit over time. Dealerships will frequently lower labor rates, goodwill repairs, give things away, and do their best to stay right in the eyes of the customer as a loyal customer generates profit over his lifetime as opposed to screwing them over and having them never return. A lot of people and especially on forums have horror stories but it doesn’t make business sense to chase every customer away. There’s only so many customers in each market region and growing your customer base is the profit your taking about not shifting quality for quantity. Poor service is reviewed all over the Internet including google, here, Yelp, dealer rater, the list is endless. A dealership pumping out poor quality won’t be a dealership very long unless it’s part of a larger parent company that can afford to shift customer from one brand to another.So not all dealerships are created equal. Your job as a customer and consumer is to do your home work and call around for prices and judge your service based on the experiences you’ve had. Regardless of what you read in the Internet BMW dealerships are in the profit business but focus on quality and a returning customer base. Better service means return customers and loyal enthusiasts willing to spend more money at that dealership. If you have a shitty experience at a dealer there are plenty of other dealerships bending over backwards to get your business as they know there are many other manufacturers and shops bidding for the same customer. At the end of the day tell your dealer when they have done right by you but tell them when they have done wrong as well and I’ll bet most try to make it right in some way.Click to expand...Good post Hot!

I got rid of it with about 73k miles. I really enjoyed it but my extended warranty was about to expire - and it had 3 major engine oil leaks within a 5 month period.The 2019 was nice although there were several tech issues. I am about 5 years away from retiring and just decided to invest my money elsewhere, instead of driving a nice vehicle with expensive maintenance. For example, with only 18k miles, my tires needed to be replaced and we all know how expensive those can be.Sent from my iPhone using BimmerfestClick to expand...As a FYI, to my knowledge, BMW has never sold a V-6 in a production vehicle.

mackerman22,"moRider said:+1I live in an area with 8 (yes eight) BMW dealers within an hour drive. The quality level is similar because the dealers know they have heavy competition. Willingness to negotiate on price, services, and parts is all over the board - as is the knowledge and friendliness of SAs and salespeople. E.g., when I was shopping around for the MPPSK (expensive but worth it IMO), the closest dealer to my house was quoting $1,000 higher for parts and labor compared to a dealer 40 minutes away.Moral: shop around if you don't have a positive experience at your nearest dealer and give feedback to that dealership.

ppointer,"Autoputzer said:Run-flats tend to wear as if they're under inflated. That's because the sidewalls can't stretch as much in the circumferential direction. That circumferential sidewall stretching is why radial tires wear more evenly than bias-ply tires.I changed my mind and got the X3 aligned shortly after the 17k mile tire rotation. The front toe was out. At the 24k mile rotation the average outer channel wear was only 0.07/32"" more than the average inner channel wear. At 24k miles, I also goosed up the pressure to 39 PSI, front and rear.I've found that (non run flat) Michelins are very sensitive to pressure. It's easy to over inflate them, causing excess center channel wear. But, that means it's also easy to dial them in to a perfect pressure.""Performance"" and ""all-season"" are usually contradictions. But, Michelin makes a Pilot Sport A/S 4. They're skewed more toward dry performance than snow. Reviews say the dry performance is 10% better than the PS A/S 3+ that it replaces. They also last longer than the summer, ultra-high performance PS 4S.Frau Putzer's X3 will get some PS A/S 4's after the OE Bridgestones are worn out (60k to 70k miles). We'll be living on a hilltop where it snows by then. So, I'll also buy a dedicated set of snow tires and wheels.There's a $70 rebate on four Michelins, ending this week.There's a parts list floating around for converting a 7's trunk to hold a spare tire and jack and still have a flat trunk floor (but raised up about 6"").Going from run--flat Goodyear LS2's to Michelin PSS's transformed my 535i. I got 40k miles out of them, now replaced with PS 4S's.They didn't make my size in PS A/S 4''s when I bought my PS 4S's. Otherwise, I'd have got the A/S's.I've improved my ""tire whispering"" spreadsheet since my post above. Here's the X3's data at the 17k-mle and 24k-mile tire rotations. The 24k-mile data shows that my alignment was $145 well spent. For the current rotation stint, I'm running both the front and rear tires at 39 PSI (measured in the morning). The OE Bridgestones (like most Michelins) came ""round shouldered,"" with 9/32"" of tread in the inner and outer channels and 10/32"" of tread in the two middle channels. So, a little over inflation will square them up and make the tires last longer.View attachment 1033601View attachment 1033602Here are the tread pattern of the Michelin PS A/S 4.

frooky,"Autoputzer said:Thanks, ppointer.I got a lot of time on my hands these days, and I like playing ""outcome manipulation games."" Some of these games can have practical benefits.Race teams dial in their pressures by taking pyrometer readings across the tires right after the car comes into the pits. The hotter areas are carrying more weight. My ""tire whispering"" process is sort of an ultra-slow-motion version of that, taking six months instead of a few seconds.One of my motivations for ""tire whispering"" is that I'm somewhat of a tree hugger. Tires are an environmental disaster, from deforestation to make rubber plantations, toxic tire granules washing off roads and into streams causing fish kills, to disposal of old tires. I'm also... well... umm... a money hugger, and tires are freaking expensive.My lifespan records for sets of tires are: 79k miles, 74k miles, 70k miles, 70k miles, 68k miles, 64k miles, 60k miles and 60k miles. The 68k miles, 64k miles, and one of the 60k miles sets of tires were high-performance tires, but they were on light cars (Civic and Sentra SE-R's). I can only get about 40k miles out of high-performance tires on BMW's. The 74k mile set of tires was on a full-size pick-up truck.My service writer at BMW of Bubbaville asked me to please not tell any of her customers that I get 50k+ miles out of tires on BMW's She said they'd be mad... at her.If anybody wants a copy of my tire whispering spreadsheet, PM me with an e-mail address that takes attachments.

The whole package can go on the roof too. Also, when you ordered your new car why didn't you purchase the spare wheel & tire from BMW for $150. It would have been a great option and really helped you out in this situation. Just wondering.","June 11, 2021"
grwasserman,"Good questions. The 30e has no room for a spare, wrench, or jack. So having a mounted wheel would only help if there was someone around from whom I could borrow the correct size wrench and a compatible jack. On the 30e a spare is simply not an option.","June 11, 2021"
Z4530i,"For emergency situations (and especially for run flats), you could take a radial tire plug kit and small air compressor along. Unless it was a large hole, you could plug it (fairly easy with RFT since they don’t lose shape). Air up with the compressor and drive into the nearest town, or home at a reasonable speed.","June 11, 2021"
Z4530i,"Most people can’t use that plug when camping. That plug is usually installed by someone who can remove the tire from the wheel and has the equipment to drill the hole out, clean the interior at the hole and apply the accompanying glue. So, a temporary DIY patch, even if leaking, will keep enough air in the tire from damaging the sidewall on the way to having it repaired. Discount tires will repair RFTs for free if the hole is not in the sidewall or outside the outside rib.[/QUOTE]","June 12, 2021"

FredMB,"Not sure what she’s after specifically but standard X3 steering in the US is adaptive, as in lightest when parking and heaviest on the highway, with some changes depending on driving modes.The X3 is an SUV, I would avoid turning it into a rattle cage with sport suspension, 21” rims etc.Horses for courses.","June 3, 2021"
Herbie,"Her main concern wasn't the speed-dependent behavior, more that she felt uncomfortable with the steering feel outside of the Sport mode - namely that when cruising curvy roads in the 40-60mph range, the (non-Sport) steering was overboosted (""if I sneeze I'll end up in the oncoming lane"") and lacking feedback from the road.I agree that ultra-stiff suspension and the largest wheels aren't a great choice - that's why I'm trying so hard to isolate which option packages will give her the control over the steering feel. She'd be happy with a relatively softly-sprung suspension with a higher aspect-ratio tire as long as the steering was more to her liking.","June 3, 2021"
kjx,"The solution is simple - drive in Sport mode at higher speeds, like most of us do. You can tweak which components are in 'Sport' mode when the car is in 'Sport' mode. You can leave everything in Comfort except steering if you wish.","June 3, 2021"

moRider,"kjx said:I have it on my 435i GC - it's very apparent it's there. Especially when I compare driving it to other cars.The steering wheel has fewer turns lock to lock. Off center, it behaves like normal with the same amount of sensitivity. But when you want to make a sharp turn, you can get to that very quickly with lesser rotation of the steering (hence 'variable' sport steering).This is very useful when you want to take sharp turns at higher speed. Becauseyou won't be limited by how fast you can turn the steering wheelas much (especially when the rest of the car is easily capable of delivering such turning performance when asked).Externally, this appears to cars following or people observing as superior agility (when combined with the best tires, suspension settings, etc.). If you drive the car like regular commuters do, the feature may not be apparent.Click to expand...Makes sense and this was what I've read too. I guess driving in the suburbs hasn't let me fully experience this - except for highway onramps!","June 3, 2021"
FredMB,"1.5 turn steering is standard on MINIs, it's part of their gokart feeling. My wife had one for a while and I loved driving it except on the highway where the quick steering detracts comfort, especially for the passenger who's nudged left and right all the time. I haven't tried a BMW with variable sport steering yet but would be curious how that feels, preferably on a sedan not an X.","June 3, 2021"
Le Chef,"EPAS is not going to give you road feel. Modern BMW’s, unless they’re real M cars, are devoid of road feel. All the modes do from Comfort through to Sports + is give you more weight. The steering rack does not change. The bushing does not change. It’s simply more weight.","June 5, 2021"
kjx,"The base model X3 M40i will change steering feel in sport mode. It doesn’t matter what package you have on top. In any case, you should test drive the exact spec you intend to buy as variations in wheels, tires, suspension, steering rack (variable sport steering vs normal) and the engine affect how the car feels overall.","June 5, 2021"

In the US, the G01 comes with an acoustic windshield and standard glass on the sides. I believe that the extra noise reduction of the windshield actually accentuates any wind noise when it gets to the side of the vehicle. Further evidence of this is after I installed the acoustic glass, it now seems that I hear a slight bit of wind noise by the back passenger doors that I didn't hear before. This noise is not annoying, I just find it interesting that the acoustic glass makes that much of a difference.This upgrade has made the vehicle more enjoyable to drive on interstates (the noise was most noticeable at 65+ mph.)Front left part:RealOEM.com - Part SearchGenuine BMW 51-33-7-464-061 | Side Window Door Left Fron 513210 | FREE Shipping on Most Orders $499+ OEMG! | getBMWpartsFront right part:RealOEM.com - Part SearchGenuine BMW 51-33-7-464-062 | Side Window Door Right Fro 513210 | FREE Shipping on Most Orders $499+ OEMG! | getBMWpartsClick to expand...I'm with the military overseas and have a US Spec 2021 X3 Xdrive 30i with the wind noise and my local German BMW dealer stated acoustic windows aren't available for U.S. models...only German Spec models.

Z4530i,you have 220v coming into your panel. Have an electrician run a 30 amp 220v line to the area in the garage where you’d plug in. Don’t know where you are in the country but electricians are usually $65/hour or will sometimes quote a flat rate for the job. Cost of the job pretty much depends on the location of your panel and the size of your existing panel (do you have space and capacity for a 30 amp dual breaker).,"May 8, 2021"
RMBMWX3,"LogicalApex said:Check the manual as it will have all of these detailsI'll comment in relation to my 530e as I'm sure it is the same for you as well. But you can counter balance my statements with what your manual says and, obviously, you manual wins if we're in disagreement.The screen you're looking at is only concerning Level 1 chargers (120V) where the EVSE (Electric Vehicle Servicing Equipment aka charge cord (not really a charger since the ""charger"" is actually in the car)). It allows you moderate the current between 16A, 12A, and 6A (or something in that range this is from memory so I could be off slightly). You'd want to turn down the charge rate if your breaker isn't sized enough for Maximum and/or you have other items on the same breaker. This will prevent the car from overloading that line.Level 2 ignores this setting (240V w/ EVSE) because the car can communicate with the EVSE directly to ask the EVSE for the maximum current the car can charge at (16A @ 240v for all BMW PHEVS as far as I know) and the EVSE will supply the car the maximum it is capable of delivering (which can be less than the 16A the car asked for). Level 1 doesn't have this ability. The car can't ask the electrical panel anything about its abilities. Level 2 is the way to go if you can as it will charge really fast compared to Level 1. For my 530e Level 1 (120v) @ 16A took ~12h to charge from flat while Level 2 (240v) @ 16A takes ~2.5h to do the same charge while being more energy efficient at the same time.You don't need to use the BMW EVSE you can use other EVSE that fits your costs and other feature requirements. I use a ChargePoint EVSE since I like the WiFi connectivity of it and the BMW EVSE is overpriced for the little it offers.Click to expand...Well, that is interesting information. Thank you. I have combed the X3 manual and those details are just not there. (Somebody let me know if I missed that.) I certainly did not understand that the screen shot of AC Settings - Charging Current only applies to the Level 1 charge cord. I did not appreciate that the car maxes out at 16 amps at 240v either, which would make a 30 amp 240v circuit more than adequate. Aside from initial equipment costs. are you saving much in terms of energy costs using the level 2 versus level 1 equipment?","May 8, 2021"
jeff661,For an X3 if you have overnight to charge you don’t need a L2 charger. however if you are trying to charge multiple times per day a L2 charge will enable you to do that. I don’t think there’s much difference in the efficiency between L1 charging and L2. Certainly nowhere near enough to justify a $1000 charger. I used a level 1 charger to charge my 530e for 3 years.

Additionally, the grid found in your manual is absent in the X3 30e manual. The lack of that grid and more limited information led me to some wrong assumptions in regard to the three current settings.

mwhayden,"ECinEI said:We recently purchased a 30e as my wife's daily driver and it's been a challenge to figure out the charging process. Are you using the BMW supplied level one charger? If so, you may want to adjust how much charge the car can accept. The supplied charger is set to it's lowest level by default and if I recall correctly only charges at 6 amps. You'll see this figure on the dashboard display while the car is plugged in. By adjusting to the highest ""current limit"" it will charge at 10 amps. The instructions on how to do this are on page 291 of the manual. At least that was my experience.I bought a Clipper Creek level one charger (12A Level 1 EVSE PCS-15 Portable| ClipperCreek) for our garage and that charges at 12 amps. We generally, after making these adjustments, can get a full charge in about 8-10 hours. The way my wife uses the car this works out fine. Of course get a level two charger and you'll charge much quicker. I've also noticed that the light on the fourway flasher/warning light switch appears to light while the car is charging. It appears to turn off when a charge is completed. I couldn't find any confirmation of this in the owners manual, which I think is somewhat poorly written and organized.I've also noticed that the cooling fans may come on while charging so I assume the charging process must generate heat. We live in coastal NC so it can get pretty hot in our garage this time of year.You may need to activate and adjust the battery control function to get the car to charge while you drive, see page 129 of the manual. There is also, if you haven't found it, a display called ""energy flow"", page 149 of manual, that shows whether or not the car is on battery or ICE power and whether or not the battery is being charged. Oddly, it appears that this display can't be saved by using one of the preset buttons nor can it be pasted into the control panel.We really enjoy our car and probably 90% of my wife's driving is done on battery power. We're going to see how we do using a level one charger, so far no problem. You have until the end of the year to claim a tax credit for installing a level two charger.

You slao need to take into consideration that you get a just under $6000.00 federal tax deduction for the car & $1000.00 for installing the charger. For us, it makes sense as the car drives only 5 or 6 miles per day. I have had a full tank of gas for the last 2 months. You are correct though about highway driving. If most of your driving is long distance or even 30-40 miles per day, a hybrid probably will not make sense. Like I said, they are not for everyone.","September 4, 2020"

The first 2018 X3's fob battery to die was at about two years, and the second one was at about 2.5 years.The new ones might have to transmit stronger to overcome all that metal in the fob's exterior now. Also, the new fobs have motion sensors that turn the fob off if it hasn't moved for a few minutes.

The twitchiness while driving, poor layout and small icons on the AC/heating controls, and the whole BMW philosophy of interior design where the dashboard stays on for a long time after a shutdown, why?I also do not like the very touchy brakes, it is quite hard to modulate and brake smoothly.

For reference, my wife had a Subaru Outback before and its suspension was notplushby any means, so it's all a matter of perspective. Also, tires make a big difference, so ditch the run flats if things get too firm.","February 22, 2021"

Performance driving is out of the question.I have collected mixed opinions: some say the adaptive suspension is much better, others that it's not that much different, and yet others that the regular suspension is better suited for daily driving.I plan to get the 18"" or 19"" tires, so that should also help with the driving comfort.What complicates things for me a bit is that I'm looking to buy a used 2019/2020 model, so getting the correct config is not as easy as ticking a box. So I want to figure out if I should prioritize looking for this option, or if I could live without it.My experience: We test-drove a model with M Sport package + adaptive suspension on 20"" tires and we were surprised by the driving comfort and handling. But there was no option to test one with the standard dampers, so I have no point of reference.What is your experience with the x3 suspension and driving comfort? The question is about the regular suspension, not the sport one since that's what you get with the xLine.Click to expand...Don't over think this. If this is a daily driver, even with rough roads, don't waste your time worrying about adaptive suspension. If you do drive a little more ""sporty"", then maybe.

But test drive both, my guess is IF they don't tell you which is which before you test drive the two, you won't be able to tell the difference.Excellent choice to go with the 18"" wheels. You get much more tire sidewall on the 18's and that will make for a nicer ride...also there are more 18"" tires to choose from in both RF and non-RF. I have the 18's on my 2020 and couldn't be happier with the ride. I personally like the RF especially since I have no desire to change tires on the side of the road too difficult and too dangerous ( I've read too many stories about people getting killed doing so). IF I didn't have the RF tires I'd probably toss a spare in the rear for out of town drives but still call someone to change it.......but since 90% of my driving is done in and around the Chicago area or within 100 miles of it I'm fine with RF tires.Click to expand...Actually, BMW X series are SAV’s (Sport Activity Vehicles), and the sports suspension is definitely a plus on two lane (country) roads, freeway entrances, and crash avoidance maneuverability.

The owner's manual says, and it had been the case, that the heated passenger seats, front and rear, would only turn on if someone was sitting in the seat with the belt buckled. Yesterday my front passenger exited and the heated seat stayed on. I have since discovered that now I can turn on ANY of the four heated seats when they are empty, unbuckled.3. [Good].

My best was 30.7 MPG, pure highway, 72 MPH, AC on, with a good tail wind.You didn't say how many miles you have on the car. Fuel economy will improve after it gets broken in. It can take up to 10k miles for an engine to get fully broken in. Also, there are varying degrees of urban driving. Cars burn more gas before they're warmed up, too.

I leave the house before 5 a.m., avoiding most of the rush hour traffic and getting there when the service department opens at 7:30 a.m.I keep records of our X3's OBC MPG and the actual ""gas pump"" MPG. Since new, the OBC MPG has been 3.7% lower than the actual gas pump MPG. But, the correction factor is slowly drifting from -3.7% toward zero. I had the dealership adjust the MPG calculation last week, reducing it by 3%. I didn't have them do the whole 3.7% because of the drift toward 0%. With the drift, I expect the error to eventually go away and then go positive.This morning, the car showed an indicated 36.2 MPG for the 92 miles drive. That was in EcoPro, but with the air conditioner on. Accounting for the remaining error after adjustment, the real MPG still would have been 36.0 MPG. A previous morning trip over to the dealer yielded 34.7 MPG, adjusted for OBC error. I started today's trip 15 minutes earlier and had good luck with traffic lights.I'm running the tire pressures at four PSI over what the door jamb decal says, to have the tires wear down evenly (another of my efficiency and math games). I also have the OE non-run-flat tires, which adds ~1% to MPG.Coming home, I had more traffic, made three stops, and was lugging 270 pounds of bottled water from Sam's Club.

Not sure why they changed it, as anyone used to driving a newer BMW already knew to hit the button twice when turning off and exiting, but it was changed.I have a suspicion that the car seats I have in trigger a ""passenger"" even if they are empty and that is why it doesn't always turn off when I open the door, but I haven't checked this theory by taking them out.","August 9, 2018"
codex57,"Finally got mine yesterday and noticed this as I was in and out setting the car up. I have no car seats anymore and I was alone, but it kept randomly staying on. My only concern is if it'll drain the battery a lot. The plan is to use this car mostly for longer road trips, but it'll sit for a week or more in between those times. Even if I take it to the grocery store or Costco in between occasionally, I don't think that's long enough of a drive to charge up the battery.","August 9, 2018"
KevinMR,"Yeah this is one of those G01 mysteries for me. I never lock my car in my home garage, and usually the radio goes off when I open the door, but sometimes it doesn't. I've mentally added it to the mystery list including random Spotify app coming on and Nav sometimes taking me to my home address even when I didn't start Nav.","August 9, 2018"

This does not happen all the time. It's random. Most of the times, when we turn the car off and open the doors, the radio shuts off, but sometimes it doesn't. What gives? We tested it in many different scenarios, even moving the key inside the house (we never keep a key fob around the car when not in use).Last time, I noticed the radio was still on, so I opened a driver door and closed it..but it did nothing.","March 3, 2021"

KevinMR,"New ""random event"" today...am outside my driveway on phone (iPhone connected via Bluetooth) waiting for my son (engine running). He gets to the car and opens the passenger side door and IMMEDIATELY my BT connection disconnects and the car says that I need to reconnect a phone. My phone went from connected to unconnected just with a passenger door opening and closing??? So weird. I had to reconnect my iPhone to the car.","December 8, 2018"
991.2,"I have been having similar issues with the radio staying on after turning the vehicle off and opening the door. For a long time (since I got the car in April) it seemed that once vehicle was shut off, radio would play until you opened the drivers door. Unless someone was in passenger seat then both doors would have to be opened. Lately (last month or so), radio stays on no matter what until the vehicle is locked or you push the radio button.Has anyone heard from BMW that they updated something? The behavior seems a lot like when Apple updates the operating system on my Iphone. All of a sudden they change your personalized settings.","December 9, 2018"
DS Nelson,"After living with our 2021 X3 M40I for 2 months, it seems this is still an issue. I've taken to re-opening and closing the driver's door after exiting to shut down the radio whenever this occurs. Seems totally unnecessary, and a bug that should be fixed. Haven't been able to pinpoint the exact conditions or timings that contribute to this--seems totally random.","January 24, 2021"
gphin305,"I found this works on my X3. If I haven't disengaged the auto stop/start while driving and the vehicle shuts off automatically via the stop/start when I end the trip, the radio stays on until I lock the door after existing. However, if I disengage the stop/start while driving (which I try to do when first turning on the vehicle) and then manually push the stop engine button to turn off when exiting, the radio will stop as soon as I open the door. See if that works.","January 29, 2021"
DS Nelson,"We always drive with auto stop/start function disengaged, in fact, the software is modded to automatically remember this unless in Eco mode (which we've not tried). As it stands now, the radio remains on after approx 50% of our trips, and opening the door does not trigger a shutdown.","January 29, 2021"
Rob175,"IF you have a front seat passenger BOTH DOORS MUST BE OPENED after shut down in order for the radio to shut down......ALSO, there is an iDrive Vehicle setting that must be set properly to turn off the radio after shutdown and doors opening.If the setting is correct and all doors with passengers are opened and the radio still doesn't shut off.....take it in to your dealer.","February 1, 2021"
DS Nelson,"I believe someone here suggested waiting 8 seconds after shutting the engine off before opening the driver's door. We've now tried this multiple times, and it seems to consistently work. Certainly beats having to re-open & close the door after exiting.","February 4, 2021"

mwhayden,"There are many and I don't trust any of them. Some say they can be used anywhere. What that really means is anywhere where they will be accepted. Good luck with that. Some state that you have to take your car to THEIR mechanics. That is a guarantee for cheap parts and half assed work. Also, read the fine print. Extended warranties kick in after factory warranty expire. If you but a 4 year extended warranty it starts the day you buy it. If you have a three year warranty on your new car, well do the math, you get an extra year at a fabulous cost. If you really want an extended warranty, stick with the dealer. It may cost more but you will get genuine parts and good labor.","February 28, 2021"
Closem Joe,"You're right! Extended warranties kick in after the factory warranty expires but theystartwhen the factory warranty ends. So, if you have a 3 year factory warranty and buy a 4 year extended warranty which starts when the factory warranty ends, you will have a total of 7 years warranty on your car. If this wasn't so, who would buy the damn things! Paying all that money for just 1 year of coverage? Nah, I don't think so.","March 1, 2021"

Rotorblade,"I have designed a system that tries to keep the intake valves clean like in a MPI engine. It uses a fuel injected to spray some amout of fuel into the charge pipe. This can be done like once a week or once after every ride. It has a sensor to read the boost pressure and sprays fuel at regular intervals like 5ms then 400ms pause, or whatever I want to set it up. The minimum pulse width that it can do during the test is 4ms (at least that’s the signal to the injector). Using the boost pressure it can extend the pulse width based on pressure and it can stop spraying if the boost is low or absent (idle). It has remote control for start/stop and and a vibration sensor so if the engine is stopped it will stop even if the boost indicates pressure (malfunction)in case you leave it on, plus a buzzer sound if accidentally left on because I couldn’t find a good place for an ACC so it will be connected to 12V terminal.It’s now ready to install except I was wondering if anyone knows, if I take fuel from the low pressure line will the computer figure out and do something that is not acceptable?Like it could go limp mode or EML, or reduce the injection pulse (this one would be good).Based on oxygen sensors it should react a bit to more fuel injected.","February 27, 2021"

All seasons are ok with light snow but not great and in my experience the ok performance might last the first winter and goes down hill fast. Best bet is for a dedicated set of winters. Depending on how much snow you see, there are different levels of winter tires. Performance winter tires perform better at speed and on dry and wet pavement but good snow tires like the blizzak or Nokian will win in real snow. I live in Tahoe and definitely see my share of snow.

mattldm,"Ventilated seats get a bad rap on the forums because people think they should make their backs cold... they don’t. They do however move enough air to reduce back sweat on long summer drives. The “ventilation” is not like an air conditioner blowing cold air on your face but if you drive a long distance in the muggy summer with and without the ventilated seats you will arrive much less swampy with them. For the price it’s a no brainer, however they are completely different seats and do not have as much bolstering. If you just plan on driving your car as a normal driver you likely won’t notice. If you plan on mountain road carving your X3 then maybe the additional bolstering will be noticable.","January 16, 2021"

harry001,"21 days? That's crazy! I thought it wound be at least 1 month or 2. Maybe they are not producing as much as pre-Covid so factories have higher capacity. If you plan to keep the car for a while, I think purchasing is a better option. For me, I like the drive something different every few years, that's why I'm into leasing. Btw, what do you think of BMW's maintenance programs and other tire or windshield protection program? Trying to think if I should purchase those with the lease.","October 22, 2020"
Unpaintedhuffhines,"hi. Great forum here. I was wondering if I could get some opinions.Drove the X3 (4 cylinder). Meh. It was okay, nothing too special. X5 was too big. Then dealer said ""hey, you should try this one (the M40i). Whoa. okay, I'm sold.I live in Texas and can't park in a garage, so it gets so hot that you lose your sense of humor for about 3 months every year. I was looking at the ventilated seats (my 2014 Jeep has ventilated seats), however, either they don't make many, or everyone buys them up, but dealerclaimedto only find 2 in the entire US of A (both I think had every option available, so MSRP is about $66K).First question: should I hold out for ventilated seats? I hear they are different seats (not as comfortable) which concerns meSecond question: I am reading here that 9%-12% off MSRP is fairly typical.

mwhayden,"Leasing is not an option for us because of the mileage factor. I do not buy $60K automobiles to sit in the garage. Most leases cap you at 10-12k/yr. I have had my 2020 X3 30e for six months and am taking it in next week for the first 10K service. If you are a low mileage driver and like a new car every three years with lower monthly payments, a lease could be for you. I certainly have nothing against leases, they work well for many people, Im just not one of them. If I could get a high mileage lease for a reasonable payment, I most certainly consider it.","October 25, 2020"

I lost all interest in the M40i until the salesman produced a non-ventilated model that had the adjustable bolsters. I'm in KY and don't have to deal with the more brutal summers further south but after having enjoyed the advantages of the bolsters, especially during any type of sporty driving, I'm unwilling to do without them.","January 15, 2021"

The rear tyres are wearing very well and evenly.The car has been checked twice at BMW and their report shows that the car is set perfectly and their tolerances are perfect, therefore showing no fault. I have 4 new BMW's previously and never had this issue, only on this vehicle. Anyone else had this issue? Could the tyres be faulty or do they just wear unevenly?","December 9, 2020"

Autoputzer,"We have a X3 30i with non-RFT, all-season 245/50-19's I recently rotated the tires for the second time and measured the tread depths with a digital depth gauge. After 10k miles, they're wearing almost perfectly even, an average of 1.3 32nds inch. I've been running them at two PSI over the door jamb decal pressures, measured when the car is cold in the early morning.SUV's are heavy. That eats tires. They also have a high center of mass. That transfers the weigh more than on a car with a lower center of mass. So the outside tires in a fast turn take a beating. RFT's also concentrate wear on the edges. All this is the perfect storm for eating tires.","March 27, 2019"

I don't think so.In my mind, it is due to the increase front load on the tires when taking turns going downhill.I drove all my cars hard before and after the move to a hilly/mountainous neighborhood.

Bfsummers,"He’s right Re cost of adding on an OEM hitch. You should have no trouble finding a suitable hitch for a 2020. Check out Curt hitches or a Hidden Hitch. They both make quality hitches. And you only need a “class I” if you are hauling bikes, but may find Class II’s are available for about the same money.There are many places that can install it for you far cheaper than a dealer. And you will save money by not having a harness wired, though you can always add that later if you ever decide to trailer anything.","October 9, 2020"
robacks,"As long as you do not have the M40i you should be ok with the hidden hitch or curt, both great companies for hitches. I would go with the class II hitch, you have more options in the future.The M40i will require the stealth hitch. Way more $$","October 9, 2020"

pjroberts,"Thanks Stuart - If it's not roo much troubleYou understood correctly. Ideally it would be one pre-fab folding mechanism, but it's clear that doesn't exist.astrohip said:I think I have what you're looking for. I have a regular cargo mat, plus a tough fabric cover that fits on the backside of the rear seats. So when the seats are up (usual position), they protect them from items in the cargo area bumping the back of the seats, and when the seats are down, they provide flat protection. They aren't as rugged as the cargo mat (which is a stiff thick material), but I've never had an issue with them.They also are cut/designed to work even if you only fold down some of the back seats.I don't remember where I got them, but if this is what you're looking for, I'll search and find the source.

ECinEI,"Autoputzer said:I just had a 330i loaner without H-K, and I can tell the difference... and I have a tin ear.The 30e is $6,600 more than a 30i sDrive. You'll likely not make that up in fuel cost savings. The 30i can actually get impressive fuel economy if you drive intelligently in EcoPro mode. We recently took a 90 mile trip on rural surface roads with the AC on in our 30i xDrive, and got 36.8 MPG, and that's accounting for the displayed MPG error. I'm as big of a tree hugger and anybody. But, the math for small hybrid vehicles simply doesn't make sense.The 30ie doesn't offer a spare tire or non-run-flat tires. A spare tire in critical on road trips. For me, ""no spare"" means ""no deal."" They were almost giving away leases on the previous generation X5 hybrids when we bought our X3. But, the lack of the spare tire was the end of that idea.We loaded our 30i xDrive up with most of the options. I especially like the cameras for parking, keyless entry, NAV, better headlights, and better front seats.Click to expand...You also need to consider the Federal tax credit you receive for purchasing a PEHV. It's around $5800 for the 30e if memory serves me. That helps narrow the gap between the hybrid and the sDrive model. There is no getting around the run flat tire thing though so you do need to be comfortable with that. My wife drives our 30e as her daily driver, to date, 2/3's of her miles have been on battery. We just pumped the third tank of gas into it last week and we've had it since mid July. Her daily driving is well suited to a hybrid with a relatively small range. I do wish the range was closer to 35-50 miles similair to the X5 45e.","October 25, 2020"
Autoputzer,"Batteries are getting better. But, the two people I know who had 2006 hybrids (Toyota and Honda) both had to replace the batteries after eight years. That wiped out all their fuel cost savings and then some.","October 25, 2020"

cgoguy,"I debated between a new 30e with the tax credit, versus a loaded 2019 with 4k miles. I ended up going with the 2019, since it was still cheaper than a new 30e with tax credit (and I was already spending far more than I intended to). I keep wishing I would have gone with the 30e, since I do a lot of short trips, and haven't been impressed with the mileage in the city (getting about 16 mpg, which doesn't seem much better than my 2011 X3). Too late now, but I think the tax credit will be around for a few years at least, and will definitely go with a hybrid in a few year.","October 28, 2020"

I'm guessing whatever thermostat is involved is shutting off too soon or it's just a crap system.

Blueangel,"Gary1227 said:The dealer I bought from told me that they sell upwards of 200 cars per month. From what I have heard, the dealers receive bonuses based on sales targets. So they evidentially more than make up the losses on the individual invoices at end of the month. The dealers that are located in my general area are rather low volume and could not offer any more more than a 4-5% discount. I guess it is not necessarily a fair system for the dealers and it Is something that car shoppers need weigh out if it Is worth the convenience to shop locally and pay more or travel outside the area to get a better deal. In my case it amounted to almost a $4,000 savings to drive 3 hours to purchase over buying from the dealer that is located closest to me. I found out about the dealer I bought from and their discounts from another member on this blog. I was hesitant that I could achieve at least a 10% discount and I did a bit better with very little bickering.

Just narrow it down to a few dealerships that are near you and ask for their best price for your specific configuration. Make it clear that you definitely plan to buy - do they want the sale!! There is no need to visit the dealership now, since at this point you can't see your car anyway. I would also ask them to provide no-contact delivery, where you will never have to sit in the dealership and wait on anyone.Many folks seem to enjoy spending time at the dealership and having the satisfaction that they got the best deal. However, all that time at the dealership is ""your"" time that is not available for anything else, so its up to you. All the sales folks work there and have to stay at work anyway. You are not taking up their time at all. They like to keep you waiting because they assume that at some point your patience will give out before theirs and you will close the deal.When I bought my current BMW I visited the dealershp and picked out my new car, and did a test drive while they estimated the value of my trade-in. Once I got home and decided it was the right deal, they delivered it to my house and picked up my trade-in. All paperwork was filled out in advance. I spent zero time sitting in an office in the dealership. That's my preference. YMMV.BruceClick to expand...Carlson, I like the no-contact delivery idea. I haven't tried it but next time I will and I'll think of you!My time is way to valuable to jerk around in an auto store after the deal is done!:thumbup:","July 17, 2020"

Dr. G7,"Perryinva said:All good advice. NEVER answer the questions ""How much were you looking to spend?"" or ""What monthly payment did you have in mind?"" EVER. Always remember they WANT to the sell the car MORE than you want to buy it. They LOVE people that gush over a car and obviously just HAVE to have it. Don't be that guy, ESPECIALLY now when all the dealers are hurting in sales big time. I would wait and see what they tell you their best price is, and make sure YOU ask about the rebates and offers. They rarely volunteer them.A tactic I've use, and did this time, is to take up a lot of the salesman's time. I'm retired, so I can spend all day there, makes no nevermind to me. Get HIM (or her) invested in you, so a sale becomes more important to them. When I bought my 2019 X3 xdrive 30i (off the lot) I started out by looking at the X1, (which I never intended to buy, as I already have a 2016 Clubman and it is literally the same floorpan/chassis with a more powerful engine, barely).. After a test drive, I told the salesman it was not for me and I let the salesman know it was too small and under powered, but X3's were out of my price range. Of course, he HAD to have me drive one and said, if we could agree on a price, would I be interested? OF course. We went at it for like 3 hours. I always said the price was too high, ""After all I was looking at an X1 kind of price!"" I was waiting for the sales manager to step in and say those magic words,,""What would it take to get you to buy this today?"" Then I hit them with my dream price, which I knew was too low. Do not be afraid to embarrass yourself or ""hurt their feelings"". They came back with a scant $500 more than my dream price, which was about $14k lower than the original asking price.Click to expand...You are good!","July 25, 2020"

ard,"I hate tirerack, but...from tirerack:As ambient temperatures get colder, typically in the 40-45° Fahrenheit range, summer performance tires lose a noticeable percentage of traction as their tread compound rubber properties change from a pliable elastic to inflexible plastic. The tire industry uses the term ""glass transition"" to describe the temperature where a summer performance tire's grip/slip performance changes dramatically. This means the summer performance tires that provide predictable traction in warm to hot conditions will be found to be very challenging to drive in cold to freezing temperatures. This is especially true when the tires first begin to be driven or if the driver aggressively applies gas pedal pressure with today's turbocharged fours or high-torque sixes and eights. Fortunately, glass transition is a reversible condition that allows the tires' normal traction to return as the ambient temperatures climb.Click to expand...Here's the thing...I dont know if ""glass transition temperature"" it the right term for this phenomena or not.

jeff3820,I drove one recently. The gas engine is detuned so it works smoothly with the electric motor. The 30e feels overall faster than the 30i even when the battery is almost exhausted.

If the battery is very low then you can***8217;t do full electric mode but you always seem to have electric augmented assist available.I elected to get the regular 30i because I wanted the spare tire option. With the 30e the trunk has to be raised to fit the batteries so no room for the spare tire.,"July 22, 2020"
mwhayden,"I just took delivery of a new 30e. The gas engine is very responsive with 30+ MPG. With electric assist, about 48 MPG. We average 23 miles driving all electric, that is with air conditioning operating. If you are highway driving, you can charge the battery from 0-100% in about 20 minutes. Gas millage drops to about 20 MPG. The advantage for us is that the vehicle drives about 12 miles per day so we never have to buy gas. Hybrids are not for everybody. If most of your driving is highway or 25 miles per trip, they are not for you. I test drove a 30i before ordering the 30e and found it to be very responsive and comfortable.","July 22, 2020"
mntblue,"Thank you. So if I understand correctly the battery will always be charged enough to allow electric motor to contribute? If not via plug-in, then via gas engine? What happens when you start with an depleted battery pack? How long does it take to charge the battery enough to start the electric motor? And is this charge process solely dependent on regenerative breaking?","July 22, 2020"
mwhayden,"There are three modes you can operate in. Max eDrive is 100% electric, Auto eDrive is the default and adjusts charging and boost based on driving conditions and situations, and battery control which maintains a user defined minimum battery charge while driving. This is also the mode that charges the battery the fastest while driving. Charging is accomplished by regenerative braking and the gas engine. While driving at highway speeds, it takes about 20 minutes to charge a completely dead battery. If your battery is completely dead, the vehicle operates like a conventional gas power vehicle.","July 23, 2020"

I am considering a plug-in hybrid and this explanation helps a lot! considering the X3 30e, the Audi Q5, Volvo XC60 and possibly the X5 45e but that may be too large for me.

astrohip,"I believe that is incorrect. SBP is part of a safety package, and that is rarely allowed to be fiddled with at the user level.If one isn't familiar with WHY it does this... when your BMW is involved in an accident, the car goes thru a variety of instant safety processes. Windows roll up, fuel is shut off, battery disconnects, and... the seat belts tighten (or ""tension""). To know how far they should tighten, BMWs do a Pre-Tension when you first start driving. That sets the tension parameters.Will BMW allow this to be turned off by a user? Doubtful.","August 4, 2020"
jdeday,"Congrats on you M40. I love mine with the exception of the seat comfort over a long trip. I am curious what your opinion is of the seats.I am also from Pennsylvania, 1 hour north of Harrisburg. Where are you located?Jeffmalbec said:Hey bimmerfesters,A lot of you have helped me customize my P1 build for my carbon black M40 and I finally took delivery of it after some covid-related production delays. Short version: it is everything I expected and a lot more. Stick around for the longer version.I will start by saying that when I first test-drove the G01 with the base engine a couple of years ago, I did not like how it drove (namely the suspension and steering feel). Then I test drove the M40 and the difference was light and day to me. I am coming from an F25 28xi and it definitely is a huge upgrade from that too. It is worthy of all the high praise I've read / watched about it and more. It makes even short trips to the grocery store fun.I will also add that I came to the decision of buying the M40 after test driving the macan S and the levante. I realize the latter might be in a different category and I'm including it here for comparison of sheer driving enjoyment.Some remarks:1- Holy s**t that B58 engine combined with the ZF transmission is a masterpiece. Smooth, linear, quickly responsive, has boatloads of power. The ZF is telepathic and I do like to use it in manual mode every now and then. Living day to day with it, you keep appreciating the engine / transmission combo more and you realize it's one of the best iterations of the BMW straight 6 engine to have existed, and one of the best transmissions too.2- I have read and heard mixed reviews about the exhaust notes, with some claiming it has artificial crackles etc.. I personally absolutely love the noise this thing makes, and find the option to control the exhaust note independent of the driving mode in the MY2020 extremely useful. The crackles especially when you lift off the throttle always make me grin like a child. If you don't like the sound (which I doubt), you can always choose a reduced exhaust note independent of driving mode.3- My absolute favorite thing overall about the car is how it transforms when you switch the mode from comfort to sport. I have adaptive suspension on mine and I definitely think there's a noticeable difference between both modes, and it adds to the overall contrast between modes. Comfortable for long journeys and bumpy roads. As sporty as you can get in a daily-driveable SUV when you switch to sport. the X3M is obviously stiffer, but I think it's too stiff for daily driving.4- Cognac leather is a big yes. Some people said it's orang-y but I personally find it a nice shade of tan. Coming from saddle brown, I like the cognac more.5-Technology is more than adequate and I believe it won't be outdated for at least a few years. Moderately better than the macan, remarkably better than the levante's.6-Acoustic glass: best 150$ spent. I test drove multiple X3's without it and the difference it very noticeable at highway speeds. The only downside to it is that when there's no wind noise, you can very easily exceed the speed limits if you're not paying attention. I feel the noise level in it is comparable to the X5 - didn't measure it, just based on driving both.7- HK sound system: good upgrade. Deeper and more effortless base, especially at high volumes8- LED headlights are insanely brighter than the xenons on my 2017 F25. Night highway driving is a breeze.There are only a few things I dislike about the car:-the seatbelts hug you too tight when you start moving. I think audi got this just right. BMW's system is verging on harrassment :rofl:-I don't like the audio feedback when you lock the car, I preferred the one on my 2017 F25. The one on newer bmw's sounds more artificial I think-It builds speed VERY easily and you need to always pay attention to that-an electrically adjusted steering wheel would be nice, but i realize they have to save sth for the big brothersOverall absolutely love it and glad I opted for a P1 build. Thanks a lot to the bimmerfest community for the abundance of knowledge and passion that ultimately led me to customizing the exact car that I want while securing a really good deal.CheersClick to expand...","August 4, 2020"

malbec,"Slapshot1 said:Malbec, I have to agree with virtually all of your comments. My 40i, which took delivery of, in late February is a wonderful vehicle. I special ordered mine to ensure it had absolutely exactly, and everything I wanted. And that specifically included the often overlooked M rear differential, and M adjustable suspension. I agree that the seat belts are a little annoying. As noted, the drive train and the M tuned suspension result in exceptional performance, and the only vehicles that will exceed those capabilities are far more expensive, mega sport SUV's, that are also not remotely as comfortable, driveable or useful as our M40i's.Other than the gesture control, which I have never been able to make woork, and has only come to life a couple times when I accidentally did something, everything works very well. The one exception is something that irritates me daily. The side seat bolsters are entirely inadequate. We did not buy this version to drive like old ladies, yet any even remotely spirited driving results in me sliding over and off the side seat bolsters and I wish I knew any way at all to address that, short of spending a LOT of money and replacing the seats, which would also ruin the looks of the vehicle, and lose functionality. Beyond that, it's a great vehicle, especially for the money.Click to expand...I'm glad you enjoy yours too. It is a great little vehicle and great value for what it is tbh. Honestly as a direct comparison to the Macan S, this one wins in my books. The only one that begins to compare is the Macan GTS, which is 20k more if properly optioned. And frankly I prefer BMW's iDrive to porsche's. :beerchug: I'm 1500 miles in, and the exhaust note still makes me smile hahaha","August 15, 2020"

I know you can turn it off every time you start the vehicle, but the 2017 only activated the S/S when I put it in ""eco"". I usually run in ""comfort"" and would rather deactivate this function.I really like that you can lock and unlock the entire car from any of the four door handles.

Autoputzer,"91AKI is the highest octane rating readily available in California and in high-altitude areas of the Rocky Mountains, presumably to mitigate evaporative pollution. Most of the rest of the U.S. has 93 AKI. For most US-spec BMW's, 91 AKI is recommended, and 89 AKI is the minimum. M cars might require higher AKI to achiever the advertised performance.The octane rating is likely not your problem. You can read the error code with an OBDII reader.91 AKI isn't available where I live, but I make my own by blending 1/3 87 AKI and 2/3's 93 AKI.

Probably because I use an industry standard nomenclature, plus a well-known tagger (Mp3tag).https://www.mp3tag.de/en/index.htmlBut if there are compatibility issues, I'd be curious to know, just so I can be on the lookout.I have about 25,000 MP3s, all fully tagged, and all with cover art. About 1700 albums, although some of those are ""mix tapes"".Click to expand...You'll be fine with your tagging. I too use MP3tag. What I was getting at is that the G01 software needs properly tagged music. The F25 coped with one album per directory with no tagging, the G01 doesn't. Out of all the players I've used the G01 has the least latitude for missing tags. I had quite a lot of tracks under unknown artists as my tagging wasn't perfect, whereas it's good now.

stevehecht,Here is a photo of the carrying case. They look to be the same across brand/model lines.On this webpage:https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Com...spare+tire&qid=1595213133&s=automotive&sr=1-1,"July 19, 2020"
MikeTC1,"stevehecht said:I know that you're not supposed to secure a heavy item like a spare wheel in an open space in a rapidly moving vehicle, like on the floor of the cargo area of the X3. Inertia can be deadly. And I know that the lack of a spare wheel option coupled with mandatory use of RFs is a major turnoff for potential buyers of the 30e. But please humor me for a moment: I am hoping to purchase the 30e (PHEV) which cannot accommodate a spare under the floor because of the volume needed by the battery pack. However, it turns out that there are two secured floor latches behind the rear seats (see excellent photo here):So these latches could be used to secure a spare, and I realize that I'd have to lower all three sections of the rear seat to do it. But there would still be enough cargo space around and on top of the (~28"" high x 5.5"" wide) spare for the two of us. We would only use this option for long trips to or through unpopulated areas, which would be only a few times per year at most. Any insights or suggestions regarding viability of this idea? Getting a non-repairable flat in a very rural area happened to us last year in Colorado in my 328d and it was quite the adventure. I will not drive on RFs all year round! Thanks in advance for helpful comments.Click to expand...Why do you need to lower all three sections of the rear seat to secure the spare kit? Between the four deck floor latches and the five latches on the back of the rear seats, you should not have a problem securing the spare with the seats up. The seats will provide added protection in case of a crush. My 2 cents.","July 20, 2020"
stevehecht,"Thanks, Mike. But I don't see four deck floor latches in the photo of the rear cargo area on this website:(BTW, that website has a close-up ""+"" function that is helpful for examining the photo more closely.) I do see (I think) the three latches on the back side of the three rear seat sections. So, assuming there are the two latches on the floor only a few inches behind the rear seats and three on the back side of the seats, how would you rig up the spare securely without lowering the rear seat sections? I would want to keep the spare flat on the floor for safety reasons.","July 20, 2020"
jeff3820,There are two tie downs by the hatch...you can see these in the photos in messages 17 and 18. Then there are the two tie downs just in front of the rear seats as in message 19. Should be no issue securing a load with seats in upright position.,"July 20, 2020"

MikeTC1,"jeff3820, there really no room for anything large inside the hatch with the spare tire, jack and wrench, maybe a wallet or something really small or foldable. The shade for the rear deck would need to sit on top of the rear deck or at the rear seat passenger's foot rest area if unlatched from its normal location.","July 20, 2020"
MikeTC1,Baby seats tie-downs are strong enough to tie-down the spare tire kit if needed unless you need them for three baby seats. :rofl:,"July 20, 2020"
Autoputzer,"Yeah, but they might be too close to the front to keep the tire in place.","July 20, 2020"
MikeTC1,Bottom line is that there are more than enough tie-down to hold the spare tire kit in place securely.,"July 20, 2020"
Autoputzer,"They were almost giving away leases on F15 X5 hybrids when Frau Putzer was car shopping. But, the lack of a spare tire AND a cargo area put the kabash on that.","July 20, 2020"
MikeTC1,"Autoputzer, so did you ended up with a X5 with a spare? I don't even know if X5 has spare option or not.","July 20, 2020"
Autoputzer,"X3 30i. We got an X5 40i as a loaner last year. Big mistake! Frau Putzer's going to demand one of those next time.With X5's you can chose from a spare, third row seating, or a hybrid. I'm militant about a spare. We balked at an F25 X3 because it didn't offer one, waiting two years for the G01.","July 20, 2020"
stevehecht,"The problem with their carrying case is that there is no obvious way to attach straps to it to secure it onto the floor. I'm not eager to just place the straps over the carrying case without a secure attachment. Whatmodernspare.comshould provide is what BMW offers in its spare tire kit, one that can be strapped down to latches on the floor:","July 20, 2020"

stevehecht,"Given the four floor tie-downs (two behind the rear seats, two in the wayback by the hatch) I can only figure out one way to secure the wheel kit, using those four in a criss-cross pattern. Do you have any other methods in mind?","July 20, 2020"

beashonda,"CDq said:I bought my X3 here in South FL and got 12% off, part of that was the $3000 BMW gives you - Don't thing that they are doing you any favors on that money! By the way, $500 of that is supposed to be loyalty credit (previous owner) or you need to be replacing a BMW competitor. I'm a previous BMW owner, but haven't had a BMW for the last 3 years and didn't have a BMW competitor. Also, they told me they couldn't give me the extra $500 because you must have had the BMW within the last year. Still, they gave it to me anyway after all the negotiation.Having said all of that, beware that the panoramic sunroof is indeed a problem here ins South FL. It does make the car a whole lot hotter. If you have doubts about it, go on a sunny day to check it out. You will be able to see a bit of the sun through the sunroof cloth cover. Also, try putting your hand close to the roof as soon as you open the car's door and you'll see what I mean. I ended up buying an X3 without it.Click to expand...Thanks.Yeah, I checked out website for deals and will be as previous BMW owner (leased 4x) and now in an Audi.

So, I can easily coast in neutral when I see a line of cars stopped at a light in front of me. That seems to really piss off those who can't drive and plan 20 seconds ahead at the same time, though. They go directly from gas pedal to brake pedal with no coasting in between, and get mad when I don't do the same.2014 and later BMW's with automatics have coasting-in-neutral built into the EcoPro logic.

Rob175,"Most ALL factory extended warranties can be purchased UP TO the last day of the original warranty expiration date. (Few if any dealers will tell you that unless you ask them) In addition, ANY BMW dealer can sell you the extended coverage so it's wise to shop it around among dealers in your are and beyond.Years ago, I bought an extended Toyota warranty for a Lexus on the last day of the original warranty and from a Lexus dealer 1,200 miles away over the phone. Most dealers quoted $1,500 to $2,000 but I found a dealer in Louisiana who sold me the same Toyota policy for $750.......so shop around!","July 4, 2020"

Bottom line - you have a much shorter rubber cushion between the pavement and the wheel, so your fancy BMW wheel takes more of a beating on rough roads.

However, the M40's base suspension imho is a lot better. I'm not sure what your budget is, but the difference between the 30i and the M40i in general is night and day, so I would take the M40 for a drive before making any decisions.","May 25, 2020"

BobsM3Coupe,"Autoputz, are you serious or are you mixing the different octane ratings for real?","March 24, 2018"
karateboi87,"Autoputzer said:Sure.That's what the oil companies do. Gas stations don't have a tank of mid-grade unleaded (89 AKI). They just have regular (87 AKI) and premium (91 or 93 AKI). They blend regular and premium to make the mid-grade.They don't sell 91 AKI where I live, and my BMW doesn't need 93 AKI. My blending to get the BMW recommended 91 AKI will save me about $800 over the 100k miles I'll keep my 26 MPG 535i. It's too soon to see what the X3 30i's overall MPG will be. It seems to do a little better than the 535i.You're in California. So, you likely only have 91 AKI premium. But, most of the country only has 87 AKI, 89 AKI, and 93 AKI.I've also found a generous gas pump, #6 at the Circle K Shell station in the next town. It looks like it's giving away about 1.5% free gas. I make a point of taking one of my cars with a near empty tank when I got past there on other errands.I filled up the 535i tonight. It took right about 60 seconds to cycle the gas pump a second time. I saved $3.12 by buying 5.2 gallons of regular. After my 5% credit card rebate, that's down to $2.96. But, that works out to $178/hour for my time. Most people who are making $178/hour after taxes are naked when doing so.Post #29 has a spreadsheet fuel logbook, and instructions for what Frau Putzer has to do when she's putting gas into her X3.http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?p=12424224#post12424224Similarly...I hyper-manage my tires' pressure and rotation to extend their life. On average, I've got 56k miles out of tires I've taken from new to worn out. I've taken four sets of tires past 70k miles. My high-performance are only good for about 40k miles.I also coast up to a line of cars stopped at a red light. My first BMW had the original brakes all around at 115k miles when I sold it. That saved me $500 as a DIY or $1000 if I had the BMW dealer do front brakes.I turn off the lawn sprinkler when it's going to rain. That saves me about $5/day.I optimize my credit card rebates. This year, I will get $2700 back from my credit cards, plus another $500 toward my next GM beater (a 2019 Chevy City Express). I'll get close to $4k back on the City Express, points accumulated over 84 months.Click to expand...Kudos to you on all the savings... One thing I'm just not sure about your blending is, do you know if the lower grade octane and higher grade octane gas mix by itself? I don't know chemistry of gasoline very well so not sure if there is density differences and what not that could cause one to sink and other to float or if you just pump them in, is it first in-first out or will somehow mix by itself?Nothing wrong with saving $ though.

Orient330iNYC,the IR emitted by gc is likely reflecting off something and hitting the front sensor.i had some IR leaking since my tape was off by a mm (you can see the IR with a smartphone camera) and putting my hand up to the sunroof switch would trigger the alert just by reflecting off my hand and into the rear sensor on the V1,"May 20, 2019"

Rob175,Having looked at a number of YouTube videos on the 2020 X3 I've noticed that some rear storage area covers have a pneumatic strut that holds up the cargo floor for easy access while other videos do not. Some videos also show the floor cover being hinged in the middle so only the last foot or so can be opened instead of the entire floor.Questions....so does the 2020 X3 floor have a gas strut? and is the floor hinged in the middle so only a portion can be lifted?I realize that some might be Canadian versions or European versions but I specifically looked at videos from the USA.Thx,"March 2, 2020"

I would have gladly paid another $5-$10 (hidden in the car cost) for the pneumatic strut.I might have to retrofit one myself.

astrohip,"I'm not sure your first statement (the part I bolded) is correct. If you don't have Adaptive, then it's true. But if you have Adaptive, the suspension is also affected when you change driving modes.If you activate Adaptive, it then will change modes for you, in addition to the suspension being adaptive.Here is a snippet from that other post you refer to... I've bolded two key parts...sinbad4 said:Second, the Sport / Comfort / Eco Pro modes do not affect the suspension (without AMS package). Those settings primarily affect throttle, transmission and steering.The 'Adaptive M Suspension' package adds several things. Primarily it adds active, or dynamic, struts. These struts can electronically adjust themselves on the fly to be stiff or soft or anywhere in between almost instantly. These active struts are have their own network and are linked to numerous sensors and a computer controller.With the AMS package, you get a more determined ride as the X3 is no longer stuck with a static compromise.Selecting Sport / Comfort / Eco settings now also affects your ride - softer for comfort, firmer for Sport, etc.That's really unfair to put in in that narrow view, as struts are not stuck in those settings - they will react and adjust ride per wheel as required for best traction & performance in all modes.You also get an extra option ""Adaptive"" which runs vertically along the left of Sport / Comfort / Eco Pro switches. (This is the tell tale that your car has AMS.) Adaptive setting will switch your driving experience between all the modes based on your current driving and driving history.Thus, AMS will automatically switch between comfort, eco and sport on the fly in response to your driving and conditions.I believe this will also affect throttle, steering and transmission.

Noise level is important to us. We drove two cars yesterday, one with normal side glass and one with the laminated glass. There was a noticeable improvement. I also thought that there was some road noise, that the car wasn***8217;t all that quiet, even with the laminated glass.Reading various sources, it seems that this is supposed to be a very quiet car. So maybe I was just on a noisy road...? I have a (very well preserved) e39 that gets me around town, and I can***8217;t say that the X3 seemed any quieter than an 18 year old BMW sedan, which I find pretty surprising.How would you experienced owners describe the overall noise level of this car?

aztecnyc,Ordered and got mine in New Jersey with spare and 4 Mud/snow tires which i was happy to see it came with They are rated better in snow and colder climates than all season. It was a compromise for me as I did loose some cargo space in the height. The bed is elevated up about 4 inches. I was expecting it to be flat.

The floor is raised 3-4 inches, and so far, it's made not one whit of difference to me, though others have made some complaints regarding the tie downs etc. The xbimmers forum has a couple of threads with people who did work arounds for the cargo floor to lower it, and also tie down work arounds.

DTRJ,"Slapshot1 said:As the title says, I have an X3 m40i on order, set up exactly as I wanted, and with the rare, M rear differential option, as well as the M Adjustable suspension option.I'm coming from a 2015 m235ix which has been a great car, but it seemed time, as the warranty has run out. I also have an amazing Audi R8 as my other (late spring/summer/early fall only vehicle). Some very knowledgeable people in the automotive industry, execs from Audi and Porsche, and other friends with multiple vehicles strongly recommended that I consider moving to a nice, performance oriented SUV for my next vehicle to give me more flexibility this time around. It has storage to carry things I never could with my small trunk, etc.I test drove a 2015, certified Porsche Macan Turbo, and then followed it with a test drive of a new 2020 BMW X3 m40i. I was very impressed by the Porsche, but more impressed by the BMW. When driving, it felt a half size smaller than the Macan (granted its only about 200 pounds lighter). . It also felt like a far newer design, which it is. My salesman took me to a new subdivision that had just recently been paved, but no home building had yet begun. It was essentially a free race track. I really pushed the X3 m40i, and it accelerated just as well as the Porsche, and I was amazed at how well, and smoothly it handled. I'm also a hard core BMW guy, and very comfortable with the usual electronics and features.In the end, a new extremely well equipped X3 m40i, with warranty and all the rest was going to cost me virtually the same money as a 5 year old Porsche with 29k miles. Not a tough call, although I feel the Porsche is a better looking vehicle from the side view.And my only concern is that I am a single guy (engaged, and soon to be married, but no kids will be entering the picture) buying an SUV. Granted it's obviously a very high performance one, and I REALLY enjoyed driving one! People and friends that I've mentioned it to just look at me oddly, as they have always expected hot, stylish cars from me, and now there is instead going to be an SUV.Even the very positive reviews of the m40i always throw in that they needed it for the kids, dog, etc. Am I crazy buying one when no kids or dogs apply?Click to expand...I am not a single guy but want a sporty car. I have had four 435,335, etc 2 door coupes in the last 12 years. All have been great cars but wanted a change. I looked at the X3 but they are a dime a dozen here and all the colors except the maybe the blue are boring. I decided on the X4M40 in Flamenco Red with cognac interior and CF trim. I am ok with the design and I get comments on the color all the time. Since the color is so rare it really stands out. I had the car at BMW today for a software update and the guys I know their for years couldn't get over how gorgeous the combo was.

When traveling at speed, 60-120, with the run flats and moving from lane to lane it feels like you're on ice, not sliding but with no road feel into the steering wheel, with no contact to the road.I threw a compressor and patch kit in the car and went to Costco to buy the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+ and they would not sell to me without a spare in the car. Furthermore they said anytime a tire needed service I must have the spare in the car.So then I went to Just Tires which is only 2 blocks from my house and instead got the Goodyear Eagle Exhilarate which they had in stock and the feeling for the road is back! It's like a night and day experience instantly there is the correct feeling for the road again with the tres acting as part of the cars suspension. I'll leave a review after I have some mileage on them. The one thing I do notice is there's some road noise from them.Click to expand...Costco would not sell you tires without having a spare?

mtbrdad,About the same noise as the BRIDGESTONE DUELER H/P SPORT AS RFT.,"November 5, 2019"
mtbrdad,"I'm relatively sure it has to do with what happens to one of the tires after you have a flat and then what you, or someone else, does to the tire to keep it rolling.I'm sort of curious as to how Costco is going to handle any of the Audi Q7's without run flats, which my wife just got, and the compressor and fix a flat Audi includes in place of a spare. I guess I'll find this out about 3-4 years from now.","November 5, 2019"

mackerman22,"I replaced my front tires at 18,000 miles with two new Bridgestone Alenza RFTs. Now at 22,000 miles, the rear tires are at the wear bars. I can buy 2 Alenza RFTs for about $630 on TireRack and then another $100 to have them mounted. Or, I can ditch the Alenzas for a brand new set of tires for all four wheels for close to the same price. Anybody have any words of wisdom? My instinct is to just replace the two back tires. I have also had some noticeable vibration at 80 mph+ and thought that replacing the rear tires may help with this issue. Could also be the AWD tire depth matching theory...","December 4, 2019"
mackerman22,"Autoputzer said:~$300/each for a quality, performance tire is reasonable, especially in an RFT. I'm not sure what kind of quality you'd get for ~$150 each.It's conceivable that mismatched rolling diameters (from having different tread depths front-to-back) could cause slipping and grabbing in the xDrive transfer case and that would cause a vibration. But, I suspect a missing wheel weight would be a more likely cause. A bigger concern if you own your X3 and are going to keep it a while is that the mismatched rolling diameters are slowly grinding away at the clutches in the xDrive transfer case. Finally, having new tires at one end, and old tires at the other end create some surprising handling characteristics (massive understeer or oversteer) at the limits, even on dry pavement (since the rubber gets harder and looses adhesion as tires get older). xDrive makes the front and back tires wear a more even rates. So, yeah, I'd just replace two now, and then plan on replacing them four at a time from here on out.You might think about going to non-RFT's if you own the SUV. (RFT's would be required at lease turn-in.) They might last longer and ride better. You'd need a spare if you ever plan on going on a road trip, though. But, the dirty little secret about RFT's is that you really need a spare with them too if you're taking road trips.https://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=917185G01's offer a factory option spare for $150 (free with optional non-RFT's on the X3 30i's), and it's the biggest bargain on the options list.Click to expand...Thanks Dude for the reply. I went ahead and bought the two rear tires and will take your advice to swap all four for non RFTs when they wear down again.","December 4, 2019"

scootr,"Autoputzer said:I belong to both of the large military credit unions, Navy FCU and PENFED. They're rates are usually as good as it gets, and they're currently both offering 2.99% for 36 months.The G01 offers a spare tire as an option for $150. It's stored under the cargo area, but it raises the floor of the cargo area about six or seven inches. There's also non-run-flat option, but I believe that it's only available in the 19"" wheels, and not with the M Sport Package or the M40i. If you're going on road trips a spare tire is essential, even with run-flats. Here's my favorite BF thread on that:https://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=917185As far as lease vs. buy, it looks like you're decided to buy. BMW's are often highly discounted, as you have seen. But, about 60% of them are leased, and therefore back on the used car market in three years. That means that the depreciation on BMW's is horrible, especially in the first three years. If you're only planning on keeping the X3 three, four, or even five years, you're probably better off leasing.I usually (and ideally) keep my new cars to around 100k miles, and however many years it takes me to rack up those 100k miles. That's varied over the years, from four years to twelve years. With retirement and no more business travel, and more cars than Putzers now, it's now closer to twelve years. I track my costs, specifically maintenance, deprecation, interest, and property tax (zero in Floriduh), or what I call MDI&P. What I've found with BMW's is the MDI&P in the first 50k miles is about twice what it is in the second 50k miles.Because I keep my cars so long, I want what I want. I always factory order them. It took five weeks to get our factory ordered X3 back in March 2018.There's going to be some unscheduled maintenance (a.k.a. ""repair"") costs in the second 50k miles. Having a dealership with an honest, competent service department is more important than saving $500 or $1000 on the purchase. I bought my first BMW in Virginia, and the dealer's service department was horrible. If we moved back there, I'd sell our BMW's before doing so.Decide if you need AWD, ""xDrive"" in BMW lingo. xDrive adds about $2k to the purchase cost, about 200 pounds to the curb weight, costs about one or two MPG, and there's the potential for some very expensive repairs down the road, possibly in that second 50k miles. The problem areas are the transfer case and the front drive shafts. We're moving to where it snows, and we'll be living up a steep hill. So, we sprang for xDrive. In Floriduh, about 75% of the BMW SUV's sold are sDrive (2WD).That beige interior is almost white. We ended up with Mocha, because it was the only color available with ventilated seats. Otherwise, we would have gone with the Cognac.A lot of BMW's come with ""staggered"" tires and wheels, wider ones in the back than in the front. It looks really cool, but it prevents you from being able to rotate your tires front-to-back. The back tires usually wear faster, so you're usually going to be replacing tires two at a time. Having different tread depths, and therefore different rolling diameters front and back, puts a constant grind on the clutches in the xDrive's transfer case. We ordered our X3 30i with 19"", non-run-flat tires. They're SUV tires, not really high-performance ""BMW"" tires. With care and AIR (alignment, inflation, rotation), we should get 50k miles out of them (taking them down to 3/32"" of tread). Non-run-flats tend to last longer and wear more evenly than run-flats.There's a factory trailer hitch option. But, it cancels the foot-under-the-bumper opening of the tailgate with Comfort Access. I mainly ordered the trailer hitch to get rid of the foot-under-the-bumper thing, because our current garage is cramped and the foot-under-the-bumper thing is also a cat-under-the-bumper thing.Finally, I'm a big fan of the parking SONAR and cameras. The larger and more expensive the city, the more cramped the parking spaces and garages are.Click to expand...Nice post :thumbup::thumbup::thumbup:Thank you for the information.

Ziggy328xi,"drummist said:Hello all - long time lurker, first time posting. Trying to make this as concise as possible here...In November 2017 I bought a 2018 X3 330, totally taken with the driving dynamics and features. It arrived with the front end exterior panels/bumper/hood badly out of adjustment and later on the same day the HUD died. It took nearly 4 weeks to get those items corrected (including multiple body shop visits) under warranty. Then the park distance control sensors started failing, one by one, giving a warning every time the vehicle stopped. Ultimately the dealership initiated a trade assist this past fall, and since the features I had purchased were packaged differently I came out ahead with several upgrades. But a month into owning the new 2019 vehicle, there were problems with that one too.Ambient lights ended up defective on both front doors, and the sunroof shade started binding (due to what ended up being a physically broken sunroof cassette from the factory!). For the latter, the entire pano assembly and headliner had to come out. Since the repairs, the sunroof and doors have rattled like crazy and the headliner sometimes falls slightly out of place at the back of the sunroof. The sunroof is particularly loud and constant, and four attempts at resolving have been unsuccessful. To add insult to injury, my dealership's new service manager told me noises from the sunroof are ""standard operation"" and that I should just deal with it because rattles are normal in BMWs.So right now as case is open with BMW on this four-month old vehicle that's spent nearly 30 days out of service for unsuccessful repairs. I'm not sure what will happen yet, but I suppose the strongest possibilities are another trade assist or a buyback under my state's lemon law. At this point should I even consider a THIRD X3? I realize problems seem much more prevalent on forums like this one, but should I give the brand another chance or run away swiftly? Am I just having bad luck, or are there serious quality problems with vehicles coming out of SC?Click to expand...sounds like you have a ****ty dealer to me. rattles are not normal but i can probably tell you where its coming from and you could fix it yourself if you like. im a bmw tech and i will admit the new G body cars have had their fair share of issues that shouldnt be issues but they are.i wouldnt let that deter you too much. but id deffinitly find a different dealership","April 25, 2019"
Ziggy328xi,"open the shade up and there should be a drip tray in the middle of the sunroof, you can pull it down a little bit and inspect it. there should be some felt tape on each end that should be thick and supple, if its not id recommend getting some more and putting it on top of the existing stuff.","April 27, 2019"

The new 2020 model that I just recently learned from my dealer has only a total $1,750 incentive, it is a lot less than the 2019 incentives.Had I bought a 2019 model I would have had a much better deal due to the larger incentives.I looked all over and at many BMW dealers for the right 2019 X3 M40i with the colors and accessories that I want and unfortunately I could not find any, even when being flexible on colors and options.I even could not find any new 2020 models that I liked, so I was forced to order a new 2020 model from the factory with exactly the colors and accessories that I wanted. So waiting for about a month is worth it to me.Yes, I did pay more for the 2020 than the 2019 model......and I am also getting a more powerful new 2020 engine with 382 HP instead of the 2019's 355 HP.I could not find true and accurate dealer invoice prices.Also it is very unlikely to buy below invoice, this just does not make any sense. That leaves just the factory holdback as a profit to the dealer. I doubt any dealer would be willing to sell below invoice.Am I missing something here? If I am wrong then please help, clarify and teach.Maybe the experts here, like Jon Shafer, can tell us what would a reasonable and real workable below invoice price be on the X3 I just bought for MSRP of $65,325 which does not include the Destination Charge. We will all appreciate this expert advice.Click to expand...What I have heard is the dealer holdback can be as much as 5% now. That would be about $3200 on a 65000 dollar vehicle. Many dealers wind up with 3-4%. I have always paid invoice for my last 6 BMW's until this 2020 X4M40 that I recently ordered. Msrp was just shy of $70000 Had no problem as my CA wrote it at $1000 under invoice before all the incentives I was entitled to which was 1500 loyalty plus 1500 lease credit","October 13, 2019"

I currently have a 2011 535xi MSport with the 19"" wheels, thankfully shorn of their run flats. One reason I was moving up to the X3 was to get the taller sidewall, for defense against our abominable roads here during winters in the Northeast. Talking with Tirerack about whether a 245/50r19 would be any better than my 245/40r19's yielded an interesting answer. They said that the extra one inch in sidewall height would not give any more defense against potholes, and if I wanted to order the 20's, it would change very little.I was wondering if anyone here had any real world experience with the 20"" rims, and how they tires have held up to the winters in the north.

I use a digital Michelin hand held gauge and there is about a 1 pound or less difference between what it shows and what iDrive shows. Even if you are extremely lazy, and even if you do not rotate, there is no excuse for not checking your tire pressure. BTW you should also check your brake fluid levels and oil level either visually (for brake fluid) or in iDrive for oil level (unfortunately no dipstick).","August 11, 2019"

One two of the pairs of tires, I can top off the pressures to be exactly even between the two tires and it will show a one PSI difference on iDrive. I like getting the tire pressures on an axle exactly even (with a quality dial tire gauge).

J-RO,When my wife and I went to pick up her 2019 X3 last week she noticed that the top of rear leather seat cushion was puffy and wrinkly. She did not want to accept delivery. The sales manager acknowledged the defect and gave up paperwork that if we took delivery he would order a new rear seat and give us a loaner when it came in so that they could make the swap. One week later I noticed that the rear seat was now perfectly fine. The leather seat cushion was now smooth and taught. It was as if someone slipped in the garage at night and replaced it.

However, the long-term common reliability problems for n54s were blown turbos (anywhere from 35k miles to 60k miles typically), problematic high pressure fuel pumps, and failing fuel injectors.On the bright side, BMW realized this and extended warranties to 8 yrs / 82k miles for the turbos and 10 yrs / 120k miles for the HPFP and Injectors. But I expect much more from BMW reliability.Enter the M40i, delivering amazing power via a similar mechanical solution. Is there any reason to believe the turbo, fuel pump and injector reliability has improved over the n54s? Or should I expect similar failures on the even higher powered M40i twin turbo v6?

mackerman22,"I have the 20"" Bridgestone Runflats on my M40i. My vehicle has just over 13,000 miles on it and the outer tread on the front tires is completely smooth. The dealership (of course) recommends replacing them at $365 each. (Tire Rack has them for $204 with no tax and no shipping). Anyways, on Bridgestone's website they show the Bridgestone Alenza Runflats have a 40,000 mile treadlife warranty. For staggered tire sets, the fronts are warrantied to 40,000 miles and the rears are warrantied to 20,000 miles. My question is could this warranty be applied by the dealership?Second question is I loved my Michelin Pilot Sport AS3 tires on my last car. Could I just replace the two front tires with Michelin non-runflats and then repalce the back tires with the same Michelins when they are worn? Any concerns about the AWD system?","May 21, 2019"
Orient330iNYC,"1) Are you sure the alenza 001 runflat has a treadlife warranty? acc to tirerack it does not and 40K is a very high for a summer perf tire. the dueler HP A/S non runflat has a 40K warranty.2) mixing tires to those extremes (New non runflat all season F, runflat summer R) is def not a good idea IMHO. you will likely have pretty unpredictable handling, especially if you ever need to make abrupt maneuvers.","May 21, 2019"

My current car is a standard x3 35i (without msport package, adaptive suspension, sport seats, bigger wheels etc). 2 things I've really come to appreciate, however, are the super comfortable standard seats (i can go for hours with no fatigue) and the excellent ride quality (even over terrible roads). I'd go so far as to say the seats are the best seats i've had in a car (and that includes the 5 series multicontour seats I had previously).For anyone who had the previous gen car, could you provide your thoughts on ride and seat comfort in comparison? From what I've gathered so far, the non-ventilated seats are the way to go, and I'd likely pick the base wheels with the adaptive suspension.","May 21, 2019"

WHITEX,Welcome to Bimmerfest. I bought my X3 sight unseen. Might not have purchased it if I really studied it. (it's a boat). It does have some shortcomings...some nitpicks.

Tow bar fitters are being pretty unhelpful, they have contacted Witter (supplier of Towbar and elec kit and booked and paid for through Witter site). Witter are not sure but they think the car needs a CANBUS edit for this to take effect when car detects elecs are plugged in. It sounds like the Towbar fitter are saying this is not up to them.

Apparently the market is demanding this and eventually everyone will move to this tempo. This is a trusted source to me that did attend these meetings, so unless he misunderstood (seems hard to misunderstand, but who knows), this is what was said.Apparently manufacturers tend to lose customers to a competitor when they have a 3 or 4 year lease and their only choice to stay with the same manufacturer is to get another vehicle of the same gen (with a mild refresh). With this new tempo, anybody leasing for 3-4 years will be in a new generation every time...Case in point, my wife had a 2016 Acura MDX with lease coming due soon... The next generation MDX is not close to being launched and we did not want the same gen again (otherwise would have loved to get another MDX)... So we got 2019 Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription to shake things up. If not for the old gen, we would have probably stayed Acura.Click to expand...Given that most leases are 3 years it would make sense to move to a 6-year cycle with a more comprehensive LCI after 3 years. The current 7-year cycle with mild LCI refresh after 4 years could certainly cause people to look at elsewhere. Especially if you leased the first year and 3 years later the model is unchanged with LCI 1 year away. Then 3 years later you are back in the same model once again with only mild updates.BMW has shown a willingness previously to update iDrive ahead of an LCI or even full model change.

douggie,"Xdxml said:The new interior in my opinion of the new 3 series and the x5 look good and seem to match a new interior trend.Does this mean the new x3 interior is already outdated a year after its launch?Will the new x3 recieve the matching interior as the new x5 and 3 serieis?If so it makes it hard to purchase if u know the x3 interior will radically change I 2020 possibly.What are on your thoughts about this. I'm a bit upsetClick to expand...Yep, it's obsolete pretty much right off the bat (the x4 is worse). I do not think it will get the updated interior for 2020 (the 7 series LCI is not getting the updated interior as well), so it's going to have one of the most dated interiors in the whole lineup. It will probably still get Idrive 7 and maybe the instrument cluster like in the newer x5 and 3 series though.There's no point in getting upset. It will probably be the same for the next few generations of x3. If you really want the most updated interior, you'll have to get the x5 or 3 series.","March 25, 2019"

BMWDude2018,"The MSport wheel also has different leather. I have both and am waiting the airbag to be delivered before swapping. The MSport wheel's leather is soft and supple feeling, while the stock sport wheel has a hardness - almost like the leather has been polished. The grain is a little different, so it's more likely that the leather is just a different grade. There was a picture of the two wheels side by side in another thread where you could see the differences in leather grain. I prefer the soft leather feel.

I almost bought a 440 Grand Coupe but decided against it for the same reason.Velar: Could not afford with the typical options I would want in a vehicle; also, Land Rover reliability is always at the bottom of the list.FPace: Less performance for more money didn't make sense; also the reviews indicate a lot of reliability issues.Overall, with incentives, loyalty, option prices and overall MSRP compared to the competition it represented the best value for performance for my wife and I.Click to expand...Fair enough.

Velar is gorgeous but lacked the performance I was looking for, plus much more expensive. SQ5 was a close second, just thought the M40i was better. XC60 T8 is a nice car, but too boring. All Mercedes were over priced for the models with performance. Macan very nice but just not a Porsche guy (plus, BMW is 10 minutes from my house while Porsche is 45).

Agree about the split tailgate, was thinking about getting the crossbars for the cargo area but ultimately don't care that much, i like the lower load height on the X3 but it does feel weird now to have the cargo just open without anything to stop things from flying out. i'm also loving the smaller size, living in the city driving around tight spaces.

The steering isn't what I'd call 911 good but it's better than the 30i for sure. Give one a test drive and you'll see what I mean. There's only one thing my X3 didn't have because it wasn't offered for the 2018MY and that's the sport differential which was added for the 2018MY.

WHITEX,"malbec said:If you don't wanna read the whole post below, this is the take home message: it simply shouldn't be able to do what it can do.Background: I own a 2017 F25 28xi. And when I drove the X3 G01 30xi, I was disappointed by the soft steering and soft ride. I whined about this here and a few bimmerfesters suggested I drive the M40i and oh boy am I glad I did.A common comment that I've read / heard a lot and that didn't really resonate with me until I drove it, is this: it really shouldn't be able to do what it can do. The one I test drove had the 19 inch all seasons and did NOT have adaptive suspension or a slip diff. It was still an insane amount of fun and kept me smiling the whole time. The one thing that struck me the most is how it drives like a much smaller / lighter car; going into corners I was initially subconsciously respecting the weight and going on the slower side, then my CA advised me to push it harder and I did. It was easy to tell that I wasn't even close to its limits even though I was pushing it quite hard in winding backroads with elevations. Steering is MUCH better, heftier, quicker than the regular G01 - which for me was the biggest turn off. Seats are ok, not on par with the 5 series / x 5 but definitely much better than the cardboard seats on my F25.One thing that also stood out was the split personality it has between comfort / sport; the difference is much more dramatic than on the G01 30i. In comfort it's a great daily driver, comfortable, civilized, yet capable when you need it to be. Then you press the sport button and it turns your life around: it pops and crackles like a bat out of hell, rev matches on downshifts, and these two alone give it a whole different feeling. Now, if anyone watches the straight pipes on youtube, they did mention that the crackles can feel artificial, which I only very mildly agree with, but it's still a ton of fun and puts a smile on your face. You can still hear the crackles with the windows closed. The one I tested didn't have the adaptive suspension so I can only imagine how even better that would make it. Brakes are also a lot stronger and give you much more confidence in attacking corners because you have the added confidence of being able to brake later.In summary; I have one year left on my current lease, and will most likely upgrade to the M40 when time comes (maybe even earlier if they bring back the pull ahead program). I was considering upgrading to a macan S (yet to drive one) but I highly doubt the difference in performance would justify the difference in price.The X3 M40i won my heart.Click to expand...Wife has a Mac S...

I will cancel guidance only for it to come back on a few minutes later. This is not an issue at all times, sometimes there is no issue for days, then it starts up again. Thus, it'll be problematic to recreate at the dealership.While my iphone 6s is always connected to the car, I rarely talk on the phone while driving. Last time though, guidance came on while I was on the phone and I was not able to turn it off. I literally turn it off and it comes right back.

This will give less traction, wear out the edges of the tires quicker and give a harsher ride (since the sidewall is stiffer). On an M40i with the standard 19"" pirelli cinturato p7 I was about 4 psi low and the ride was harsh and didn't feel right, I aired them up today and what a huge difference it made in the ride.

mtbrdad,"Autoputzer said:From the Ideal Gas Law, tire pressure goes up or down about one PSI for every ten degrees F.Rubber compounds vary on how they behave in extreme hot or extreme cold conditions. You're currently seeing temperatures that are lower than normal. So, it's not fair to compare a Pirelli at -15 F to a Michelin at +15 F. One of the things that make real winter tires work so well is that the rubber stays soft at extreme cold temperatures. But, that also makes the rubber wear (or even tear) away at higher temperatures.Summer, ultra-high performance tires can take the heat, but turn to hockey pucks below +40F, and can crack below +20F. But, they stay together (for the most part) on a hot July day at Road Atlanta. Actually, then and there even those tires start melting.

Autoputzer,"But did they have the same tread depth? It's common for people to say ""My new Brand Y tire are great in the rain/snow!"" A big part of that is because the old Brand X tires they replaced were worn out.I had a 1992 Nissan Sentra SE-R (sort of the M3 of Sentra's) when I lived up north. It came with summer, high-performance tires, and cardboard warning signs about this on the sun visors. We'd get a few snows there each year.

It is a totally different car than the older X3. If comparing Macon's you need to be in a GTS to equal the M40 performance, a Macon Turbo is a totally different beast and dramatically more expensive than a fully loaded M40 (as is the Macon GTS).My best friend just traded a 2016 Macon S (went to an AMG GLE 430) which can't touch the performance of an M40; it is also significantly smaller if space is a concern.

MC-X3,"Our X3 is much older (E83), so I'm not 100% sure about the G01. The nice thing about the aero bar is that you can mount the Topper further out and even though there is no door opening I can still use the pivot without the timing chain ring hitting the car. You do need to be careful as to where the cranks are. Based on specs alone, I don't think you will have any issues. You can always go with the non-pivot model and save some $. The pivot is nice as one person can put the bike on the car.my previous rack was a bar and the mounting bits prevented me from putting the Topper far enough out to use the pivot.","December 19, 2018"

What really pushed me to get X3 30i over XC 60 T6 boiled down to 3 things: first, I found X3 to be much sportier and more fun to drive than XC 60 T6 despite having way less HP. X3, maybe due to 50-50 weight balance, was much better at sharp corners and was a simple joy to drive in every environments, especially with sports mode on. On the other hand, XC 60 despite having ~300 hp was actually sluggish and was too ""relaxed"" vehicle for my taste.Second, I preferred BMW info way better than Volvo as you brought up. Adjusting and changing everything via center touchscreen drove me nuts while driving. Coming from Benz and Audi, I still loved having hard buttons to change my temp and etc.Finally, the price. I am not sure about any other areas but XC 60 T6 w/ R design was ridiculously more expensive than good optioned X3 x30i in my region. I could have gone for T5 but if I was not happy with 300 hp. I could not imagine being satisfied with 240 hp. In addition, I mean sure XC 60 looked better but X3 looked gorgeous for me w/ dark olive metallic color. I also got an amazing deal from local dealership w/ APR bonus, loyalty, autumn bonus and amazing trade in offer which made X3 to be a bargain for me.In conclusion, go with your taste and circumstance.

WHITEX,"jjrandorin said:This is the same thing that I said that @scbeiber quoted. The only thing different I said was that I dont see the point in debating it here, because of the above.The X3 30i and M40i are the same vehicle, but the M40 comes with a more expensive engine, and more things standard than the 30i.Whether its ""worth it"" (which is the only debate one can have on this topic) is dependent on what individual wants from the vehicle. These debates about engines always turn out the same way on car forums (not just BMW).People who bought the higher end model will say that its worth it (because they bought it). People who didnt decided that for them, it wasnt. I still dont see what can be debated about engine size and worth on this topic.Click to expand...Agreed. No reason to debate engine size is right. Years ago I got into a 4 or 6cyl A6.... felt sluggish. Bought the V8. Same with the 06 and 2014 X3. Got the 3 liter. As for the M .... always wanted one.","December 9, 2018"
WHITEX,"jjrandorin said:FWIW, we did decide to replace her leased X5d with an X3 M40i as I said we might in my first post in this thread. We are getting one that is pretty loaded as we tend to like vehicle options (and I like all the safety tech, makes me feel better about her driving around).Our X3 M40 MSRP is 67,390, which is more than the cost of the entry level new X5, but her current X5 is also loaded (MSRP north of 75k for an X5d), so in effect she would be losing options (as well as losing size) if we did not get the options.She loved (loved) the car on the test drive, wanted the smaller size, and said it would be easier to navigate parking lots and such. She (and I) absolutely do... not...""need"" the extra speed from the M40i but the enthusiast in me likes it, and she also likes to ""get up N go"" sometimes. She had a huge grin on her face when she test drove it. I didnt even test drive it actually, as how she felt about it was more important to me than how I felt about it, even though we both will drive both of our cars.To answer the thread, for me the M40 is absolutely worth it, but I think there is zero wrong with the 30i. We like the bigger engine (and like the noise of the bigger engine), and optioned the way we like them, the difference in price is closer to 5k to 5500 (once you put the same options on an 30i equivalent to how we have the 40i specced).Click to expand...Congrats.

Fuzz3D,"Thanks to all of you providing feedback. I have a (hopefully) less subjective question regarding the X3 30i vs M40i.From your experience, how well do the two models hold their CC or ACC settings on the highway? Does it hold the set speed reasonably well when encountering hills and rolling terrain? I realize sport/eco/comfort modes will have an effect, but I'm hoping one doesn't have to leave it in sport mode just to maintain a consistent highway cruising speed or ACC following distance behind another vehicle.","December 10, 2018"
jjrandorin,"Thats actually a good question, I would like to hear the answer to. From what I read earlier about ACC with stop N go on the X3 (maybe the other board?) was that it sort of ""ping ponged"" in the lane back and forth instead of staying centered in the lane. Now that I think about it, I dont remember if that was the X3 or the new 5 series but it was one of those, both BMW products so probably behave similarly.I ordered it anyway on for our X3 but am interested in the feedback on it as well.","December 10, 2018"
scbieber,"For me the difference is more like $11K with a minimally optioned M40i (Leather, Premium, HK) tallying $62K vs. $51K for a similarly configured 30i before negotiation. I'll probably opt for the 30i based on the positive comments above and the fact it's a lot cheaper. Just wish we had a better blue option, Phytonic is cool but I wish we could get Long Beach Blue as a standardly available color (have to special order). The Volvo XC60 I also was looking at has a totally cool blue called Bursting Blue as one of it's standard colors (requires RDesign trim). It's a bit brighter and more eye-catching. Thanks for all the comments.","December 11, 2018"
mwpepper,"For the 3.0 and how well it holds it's speed, as stated earlier in the thread, I had the N54 i6 in the 08 335i. surprisingly, this is holding its speed as well as the 335.

To clarify, that circuit 54M going to the trailer module and brake controller n the wiring diagram is the 3rd brake light signal, so it is an on/off brake light circuit.Please note, at this time I did NOT install a trailer brake controller; just did the initial exploration to see how difficult it would be.Click to expand...Thanks for posting.

The GLC was fast and perhaps just a tad bit stiffer (by very little) but overalll I feel the M40i handles better. As far as acceleration is concerned, I personally feel the M40i is faster. Apparently all instrumented tests (GLC 43 specs vs. M40i) also show the M40i as being faster. Late 2019 should see the updated B58 being released which should keep it in front of the GLC 43.

It's a bit counter intuitive, but that's how the BMW folks designed it. Sometimes there are two small adhesive strips for each flap and you do them individually. That way the adhesive strip is as tight as possible to the body.","November 30, 2018"
codex57,"There is adhesive, but I find it's more to hold things generally in place to allow you to more easily bolt everything in. There's some minor tugging and pulling to get things flush.I guess it all depends on how picky you are. Some people would say it's perfectly flush. From a couple feet away, it looks like it. From a few inches away, I can tell it's not as tight as on my old Lexus or Toyota. The tape needed to be wider and closer to the edge. The gap on the fronts if you install on a m40i is big enough that my wife would have refused. We're picky though.","November 30, 2018"
mrich1353,"I am also very picky. I have no gaps on my M40I. I've installed BMW mud flaps on three M-Sport vehicles and all fitted well despite not technically ""available"" for M40 according to BMW. I bought from a BMW dealer on E-Bay advertising they DO FIT M40 with a money back guarantee.Without instructions, installation is tricky because you will misfit them depending on which anchors you attach first; they also require drilling extra holes to align mounts - all things can throw off the installation. Advise - take the time to fit and understand which holes line up. Also search YouTube","November 30, 2018"

Deliberate1,"Friends, I am looking at a used M40i that has ventilated seats. I have not been able to sit in it yet. But I have sat in a similar car with non-ventilated seats, and found them very sportive and comfortable. You definitely sit in rather than on them. We have an'11 X3 35i with the regular seats and they are most unimpressive, especially when compared to the sport seats in my Audi S5 which is the benchmark for me.I did find a picture of the ventilated seats on this site, but the angle the image was taken makes it difficult to determine if the amount of seat and back bolstering is the same in both versions. I am aware that you lose the bolster adjustment with the ventilated option. And I am fine with that as long as the default config is sufficiently contoured and ""wrap around.""Thanks.","December 4, 2018"
torinalth,"the ventilated seats wrap around you more than my F150 does...... and that's it. I sold my B8.5 S4 for the M40i and they are fairly on par with how they feel for side support, but that is the NON-ventilated seats. I rode in a different demo car that had the ventilated seats and they were both harder, less supportive, and overall unwelcoming. I'm sure others will disagree, but for my tastes (obviously similar to yours since we had a similar benchmark) the ventilated seats were a non-starter and I built mine without them.","November 16, 2018"

mwpepper,"update, I took the car to the dealership. As you can see in the pictures in the original post, the damage occurred at the far passenger side of the Kidney grills. This caused a couple of the slats to break and get pushed into the open shutter in front of the radiator. When I stopped to access the damage, the shutters attempted to close into the slats. I have to think that is when the shutters got damaged. They had to import the upper shutter assembly from Germany. Total time without the car was just shy of 3 weeks. The final cost was $750.00. It didn't even mar the paint. Long story short, it seems that the shutters are not all that robust. take extra care in ensuring that nothing impedes their movement.","November 7, 2018"

X3_M40i,"I've experience a dozen times over the last 4 months. Two times has been a little scary due to the car not wanting to go when dealing with heavy traffic. More of an annoyance, than a concern until today when my wife took the car out and it happen to her while making a left turn. Has anyone else had this 1-2 second delay in giving the car gas and it actually deciding what to do? From my experience, it's typically in too high of a gear after slowing down. The car hasn't downshifted yet and it pauses before finding the right gear. I know driving in Sport solves a lot of the issue, but then the car is a jerky mess if you aren't being aggressive. Love everything about the car, but this is the one thing I never thought I'd see in a BMW.","October 31, 2018"
WHITEX,No issue on my end. I tend to drive in Sport...sometimes Sport plus. Comfort is fairly responsive with minimal to no lag. Have it looked at. Do you get gas from the same place every fill up. Maybe a fuel issue.,"October 21, 2018"
X3_M40i,"It's happened multiple times over the first 4,000 miles of ownership. Gas is typically from a Top Tier station which we use for other vehicles. Not consistent and not predictable.","October 21, 2018"
After Hours,"You might have the service department check, but the hesitation may be a combination of the shifting down that you noticed and turbo lag. I have not had your problem, which is why I suggest that a mechanic look at it. Fuel starvation or a bad spark plug could be involved--unlikely, but possible. If not, in my car I have shift paddles that I can use to manually shift down if I see something ahead of when the car will react. I can use them even when the shift lever is in Drive.","October 21, 2018"
SteveBB,This has happened to me several times over the past 8-9 months I've had the car. I don't believe it's a fuel issue. I've gotten into the habit of pulling the shift lever into sport mode anytime I pull out into heavy traffic or when I'm close to the crest of a hill where I absolutely don't any type of hesitation. The hesitation has never occurred while in sport mode. My first service is due in a couple of months and I plan on addressing it then but it happens so infrequently that I believe this is a good temporary fix.,"October 22, 2018"
Schnee38,"Mine does this on occasion as well. Always use 93 Octane from either Valero or Costco and there really doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it happening. It isn't a constant thing for me either, so figure I will bring it up next time it is in for a service. I have been driving in Sport more often, although I prefer Adaptive, it does seem as though Sport clears up the issue.","October 22, 2018"
X3_M40i,"Thanks for the replies. Sounds like others have experienced something similar. And it probably isn't a 1-2 second lag, but feels like it. I would also say, it's not what I recall of turbo lag, but more of a complete pause in the car doing anything. I do throw the car into Sport Plus when merging into traffic, but my wife is used to cars without drive modes so will suggest she just keeps it in Sport.","October 23, 2018"

mackerman22,"I drive mostly in Comfort mode. Coming from a car with a 6.2L V-8, I share your concern about the hesitation. I believe it is a simply combination of the transmission/torque converter settings in Comfort mode and the turbo lag. Sometimes the hesitation makes me nervous too, but I believe my X3 is functioning as designed. If I wanted immediate maximum torque, I would have gone with another V-8 or supercharger powered vehicle.","October 23, 2018"
codex57,"LOL, it sounds like what Eco mode feels like on my 3.0. I typically drive in Eco mode due to traffic and the fact that it'll let me set the steering to Sport. Then, on the rare occasion I need to gun it, it does feel like the car just sits there thinking. And yes, Sport mode takes care of that, but I get OP when he says it can feel a little too jerky in Sport too. I think it's functioning as designed. I haven't found a happy medium yet, but I'm undecided if that's all on me or if the BMW programmers need to fine tune things a little more.","October 23, 2018"

It's why the auto start/stop defaults to on as well, even though you can turn it off.Admittedly, I do drive in ECO a lot. So easy to switch to Sport if I know I need that instant throttle response.

He now has an Acura SUV and loves it for the technology, while I love my X3 for the combination of sport and utility. I drove one of my BMWs over 140,000 miles, and had expensive repairs between about 80,000 and 105,000 miles, but once the water pump and some of the spark plugs were replaced, along with various gaskets, it became reliable again.

AndroidRobot,"Autoputzer said:The transmission downshifts on it's own. I'm just causing it to happen sooner. With computerized engine rev' matching, the wear on the clutches during shifting (upshifting and downshifting) is minimalized. Back in the bad ole' days before the computer controlling both the engine and the transmission, yes, downshifts would put a lot of wear on the automatic transmission clutches.Compression braking does put additional wear on the engine, and wear that is different than when under power. My Chevy Cobalt's owners manual said not to do engine braking during the engine break-in period (first 1000 miles). I've never seen that in any other owners manual.I've worn out a lot of brakes, but never worn out an automatic transmission. I've (we've, including Frau Putzer) also warped a lot of front brake rotors. The worst thing you can do to cause warping is do a high speed stop and then stand still for a few minutes with the brakes applied.I haven't worn out an engine... since I started using synthetic oil. The one engine I wore out was a 1.6l in a '76 VW Rabbit. But, that was due to metallurgical defects in the piston rings. It started smoking at about 70k miles, but was still running at 155k miles. At the end, it was burning about one quart of oil every 300 miles. I'd use the waste Mobil 1 out of my parent's car rather than buy new oil. It sort of got a perpetual oil change. The final straw for the car was the clutch linkage failure. Junkyards would not take my car. Finally, somebody with a house full of teenage kids of driving age, and driveway full of running Rabbits and a backyard full of non-running Rabbits (for parts) bought it from me for $50.Click to expand...I'm not saying it's impossible to break one, but as an engineer I'd rather put wear on the proper components.Here's a video from Engineering Explained which goes over why you shouldn't down shift to slow down for reference.https://youtu.be/6zzEtxJkC7Y","September 22, 2018"

That's why Porsche, BMW, VW Group, and Mercedes-Benz programs coasting in neutral into the logic of their automatic transmissions.It was dangerous back in the days of cable-actuated brakes and before manual transmission had synchronizers.My road trips north start and end with an 80 mile drive through the boonies. I activate the nav', so I know how far it is to the next stop. If there's nobody behind me, I can coast for over a half-mile before the stop in neutral. It's fun witch the OBC MPG reading steadily go up.I usually fill up in the mainland, in the 'hood. Gas is cheaper there. Ideally, I get a running go approaching the bridge, decelerating as I go up the bridge. This minimizes the extra gas I use climbing up the bridge. After I go over the top of the bridge, I throw my manual-transmission in neutral and cost down the other side. I can game the OBC (reset when I fill-up) to go past 40 MPG. I point this out to Frau Putzer, but she's not impressed.

Then, weeks later I saw the second G01 and it was in plan ol' ""free"" White, and.. it looked amazing. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of white, but this truck looks amazing (IMO) in White!","May 18, 2018"
BobsM3Coupe,"It's funny, my last 8 new vehicles were white or pearl white. So I obviously like my vehicles in white. However, when I saw the M40i in white, it just looked so boring that I chose the Phytonic Blue M40i next to it. It looks so much better, especially in the sun.","May 18, 2018"

pcmike,"Thanks. I plan on going with the stock 19s, despite actually really liking the look of the 20s or 21s... I just can't deal with the hassle of staggered wheels anymore. On my current 535 with staggered wheels I'm constantly replacing the rears 2x as frequently as the fronts. It's been 6 years with the same staggered setup on two cars and I've managed to collect 4 essentially new front tires and I have zero good rears left.","May 19, 2018"

frank23,"I'd tend to agree with that - on my 435i (xDrive) I had Michelin AS/3+ (same size front/rear), I never rotated for 20K miles, and the threadwear was within 1/32 difference.Now the X3 M40i may have more rear-bias then the 435i, but then it also has more width there (275 vs 245 front).BTW: I'm also going to swap the Alenza's for Pirelli P zero AS plus, tirerack has a $70 mail-in rebate at the moment.","May 20, 2018"

AndroidRobot,"I just bought my X3 M40i (fully loaded) with the awful 21"" wheels whose tires are hard to come by.

My plan is to go with 20*9 wheels and 265/40 R20 tires, although I'm open to trying other options.Is anyone using aftermarket wheels on their X3/M40i? I could keep the staggered set up with the standard 20"" spec (245/45 R20 20*8.5 up front 275/40 R20 20*9.5 at the back) but it all depends on what will work better.

Spoonie G,"I actually don't have an issue with the ride of my X3 with the 21's. I have the adaptive suspension. The issue that I have with the 21"" wheels is that they are matte painted. Matte paint is not smooth. The non-smooth surface traps brake dust that isn't easily removed. Even with wheel cleaner you have to scrub hard to get the brake dust off. And you can never get all of it off. End result is that you end up with a wheels that always looks dingy and dirty even after you've clean them. I'm not a fan of Matte paint on body panels but whoever decided that it is ok to matte paint wheels is a fool. I'm getting them refinished with a dark gun-metal finish when I swap out the wheels for a winter setup.","April 30, 2018"

I want to swap my Grey Poplar for the Aluminium Rhombical but I can't find the P/Ns for that trim.5. Is there a P/N for the European sun visors i.e. ones without the dumb US seatbelt warning label?

frank23,"It does work, better than my previous 435. It's important to know that the first half turn (or so) of the wheel is exactly the same as normal. Only when you turn it beyond a certain point, the ratio will change. You'll notice it only during parking, and (relatively) tight right turns at low speed. At high speed you would normally not be able to use such an extreme steering angle.","July 11, 2018"

AndroidRobot,I can only speak to the M40i what it has it standard. It does help with body control and can soften the ride depending on which mode you're in. I have the active dampers on mine and usually keep things in comfort mode. Sport mode dampers (you get sport and comfort settings on this package) make the ride firmer of course and help with body control white a bit but I wouldn't use that on rough roads for obvious reasons. As for the dynamic steering or whatever BMW calls it I don't notice a difference at all whether I'm at low or high speeds.Tldr: get it for the dampers they're worth your money.,"July 9, 2018"

I'm not quite clear on how ""adaptive"" the suspension is with this model and price point, but it's probably worth it just to have the same functionality my MINI does, ie stiffness changing between Comfort and Sport modes along with the steering/throttle.

frank23,"Just inflate it to 40 psi, or maybe a bit more if the tire maximum psi is a lot higher.

luigi524td,"Inflation for ""spare tire""Front and rear tire inflation pressures are usually different (fronts being lower than rear).Sooooo If I were you I'd inflate the spare to the higher of the two recommended by either iDrive or your door-jamb sticker so should you need to place it on the rear its load rating will be adequate.

I want to get an SUV instead of sedan because of the trunk opening and rear leg space. (and never ending AC issue)I would have stayed with 5 if they offer a hatchback that looks just like sedan instead of the old 5GT or the new 6GT, which is $85k when fully equiped like a X3Been also looking at XC40 and XC60 as well... but that's that.","June 18, 2018"

Kamdog,"NY tap water tastes great, and is less filling.We are really looking at moving to a crossover. I was very impressed with this new X3 I recently drove, and the Q5 and new RDX look promising too. The problem is both of our cars are still running fine, and few cars can match my current 535 for overall ride and goodness, but it ain't worth anything on the market. I am in a quandary: I want a modern car with all the driving aids, yet none of my cars need replacement.","June 17, 2018"

Kamdog,"Inline 6IX said:It has nothing to do with being an ""enthusiast"" or not. It's all a matter of personal preference just like you said you can't stand the shape of a station wagon. My preference for sedans has largely to do with aesthetics of the car and also because I just can't stand sitting high up. It makes me almost feel sick. I don't need any more space than a sedan (have you seen the trunk size of the 5 series?) but if I did, I would buy myself a wagon or hatchback in a heartbeat. I will never give up the driving dynamics and sporty low-slung shape of a regular car. I understand thepeople on this thread clearly despise normal cars,but it's all a matter of personal opinion and I think everybody should respect the preferences of one another.Click to expand...The tone of your argument is pretty one-sided. I too prefer sedans in general, but that I am considering an SUV has nothing to do with 'despising' sedans. SUVs have a lot going for them, just take a look at how many are on the road. I am not going to try to convince you of the benefits of an SUV, but your tone sneers at those who decide to drive them.That point of view leads nowhere.FWIW, the current X3 has more torque, more HP, and is faster to 60 than your sedan, and better-observed gas mileage in the C/D review.","June 18, 2018"

Notte,"Greetings everyone,I'm new to bimmerfest. I am thinking seriously for the first time in buying the X3. I have been reading the posts here for information to help me with this decision.Questions:1) Should I buy or lease? - I hear about the reputation of BMW being expensive to maintain after warranty. How true is this?2) Any options a ""must have"" or ""glad I got it"" in hind-sight?3) Extended warranties?4) Do insurance companies consider this a sports car? or SUV?This is all I can think of currently. If anyone has more to offer with assistance in making this decision easier and informed, please state in your post.Thank you everyone and good day","June 16, 2018"
Notte,"KevinMR said:Buy or lease is completely a personal decision. Every situation is different. Where are you located? X3's, Q50's and some other competitors don't lease very well right now (interest rate of 4% for Tier 1 credit, and ""realistic"" residual values), but I still prefer to lease.For me, Premium (with HUD) and Convenience (most have this) were the must haves. Many 2018's also come with Driving Assistance, but that wasn't high on my list (DA+ is not on many models, but it has Adaptive Cruise Control). Park Distance Control is a must-have. I prefer leather to Sensatec, but not sure that it is $1700 better. I have HK sound in my 535, but most of the time I am listening to Stern or other talk radio, so it is not necessary over the base sound. Carplay can always be added later as an app purchase so don't sweat it. Ventilated seats might matter if you live somewhere hot.No on extended warranties...you can always buy one later if necessary (if you buy....not necessary for a lease).Not sure about insurance...I assume though that it will be cheaper than my 535.Good luck with your search and welcome to the board!Click to expand...I'm located just east of Los Angeles.

KevinMR,Cool...PM sent with a recommendation.,"June 13, 2018"
Kamdog,"People fear keeping these cars out of warranty. They do so not because, these cars are fragile, in actuality they are not, but because BMW maintenance and repairs properly done are expensive. Overall, getting on the leasing treadmill will end up likely costing more over buy and hold, but your downside risk is less as you will always buy a new car and it will always be under warranty. You lose flexibility in when you turn the car in, and must deal with whatever market conditions are current and whatever models are available.As others have said, lease v buy is a very personal decision due to the many considerations. I will say one thing: don't lease a car you can't afford to buy.","June 13, 2018"

tyresmoker,"You might see better deals on the '18's left on the lot, but there is absolutely no reason why a dealer will not heavily discount a '19. It is simply a numbers game.

tyresmoker,"jjrandorin said:If the OP tries to buy a '19 right when they come out, he/she will likely NOT receive the same discounts as would be available on a 2018 at that same time (or even right now). As you said, its a numbers game.The 19's likely will not have the same lease cash or money support from BMW that the 18s will have, and this is standard practice for EVERY manufacturer when models change over.As you said, they need to move the cars, and once 19s are available they will want the 18s to move faster, so they will likely do JUST like they are doing RIGHT NOW for the 4 series. The 19s are available for 4 series. The 18s have 3k cash on them from BMW, but the 19s have none... meaning that the 18s are cheaper.That will likely continue until most of the 18s are gone.OP, if you have to buy a car in 2 months (lease ending, etc) and want the best discount, you likely want a '18 model year. The 19s will be reduced in price to where the 18s are now likely when most of the 18s are gone, which would be likely be late fall.Click to expand...Thanks for the CAPS to make your point.

jjrandorin,"There are several people here whose opinion I trust who love their new G30 5 series.... but they all ordered M sport models with the 704 sport suspension. When you guys go to drive a 5 series, if you care about handling you will want to try a sport suspension M sport model.

hispeed4fun,Im in a 335 GT with MPPK right now and lease is up soon. Besides the looks that a lot of people cant get passed with the GT it seems like the only car that really competes with the M40.

casper,"johnnytx said:I'm coming off of a BMW 5 series v6, twin turbo wagon with 300hp stock. If they still were available, I'd be buying another one of those, period. I do love the X3 M40i, but it's second choice to what I can't have. On a horsepower per pound basis, my wagon is about 90% of the power of the M40i. And I'll miss the sedan-like handling, even though the M40i doesn't feel very SUV'like.I did NOT cross shop anything with the new 4 cylinder turbocharged 2 Liters that have SATURATED the auto industry lately. That includes the 3 series wagons :bawling:, the X1's and X2's. I don't buy into the trend for cars that weigh above 3500 lbs. Just seems like you're squeezing too much out of a 4 banger and reliability will suffer in the long run.I DID comparison shop:- Benz AMG E63 superwagon. It wins over everything else hands down but way too much $$$- Volvo v60 Polestar (2016 v6 version, they dropped the v6 for the aforementioned turbo 4 in 2017 forward). REALLY fun, fun car and makes a great noise like the M40i. More sedan-like handling. Negatives: interior seemed way less refined than BMW. Overall seating and cargo space was much more cramped.- Jaguar F Pace. Really fun as well, but crazy expensive and a little too big and bulky for my taste (comparable to an X5). Really good technology. I wanted to look at the smaller E Pace but couldn't find one locally to test, and I fear buying the first year of a new model.- X5 50i. Fun. But felt bulky. Getting the adaptive suspension helps a lot, but surprisingly the rear row leg room is worse than the X3 (apparently to the benefit of the X5 cargo area). Width of the rear row was much more comfortable for 3 passengers, whereas the X3 back row is really only good for 2.5 passengers. Rotten gas mileage.- Infinity QX70. I really wanted to love it, but it was obvious that it was the final year of a dying model. Technology was really outdated and very few premium options/packages. Good to nearly great performance and handling. Rear row was very cramped. Intrigued by the upcoming QX50 next gen though.- Researched: Audis. Lots of them. Their wagon is underpowered (damn turbo 4cyl!) and a little small. Q7 is too big, Q5 underpowered, and SQ5 as mentioned above is reportedly disappointing. Subaru Impreza Hatchback (just too unrefined).Even typing this I'm realizing I'm really torn about the X3 M40i. I'm not buying it because it's my favorite, I'm buying it because it's the best I can buy today in the U.S. If I was a Euro buyer my choice would be very different. Hell, maybe I'll cancel my custom build order and just hang onto the wagon for a couple more years and wait the market out a bit more.Click to expand...BMW 5 series has inline 6, no V6 on BMW","February 1, 2018"

deenx,"My primary issue with the X1 and now the X2 is that Blind Side is not available. I simply find it incredibly hard to believe that BMW offers an incentive for recent grads... but then doesn't offer them an entry level SUV/SAV/SAC with state of the art safety features.And while I'm at it.... anyone else concerned that BMW must have read the GM manual on how to cannibalize it's product line? Let's see... there's a SUV... SAV... SAC..GT... Sedan.... convertible... coupe...

You'll probably need an uprated clutch, but that's another story.The 2.3L from Ford comes from the factory with 350/350, for crying out loud.228hp from the BMW turbo 4 is pretty anemic by today's standards....I agree, the N55 sounds nice, though! The B58 sounds even better!Click to expand...Hmm-I'll admit that I haven't followed the tuning scene very closely. Are the bmw tuning options more expensive and less reliable? I do recall that VW/Audi's 2.0 (all the various flavors) had iron blocks for a long time (do they still?). If so I could see how that would contribute toward reliability.The b58 does sound better because they're now using active sound enhancement on all its applications. With the n55, it was only used on the m235 and m2 I believe.","March 14, 2018"
hooligan_clt,"Based on comments from the X1 community, the N20 seems comparatively fragile and a Dinan tune will cost you $1500 and give you about 310HP. JB4 would obviously be much less, but only ~65hp increase on an otherwise stock car.I look forward to spending a little quality time with the wife's M40i after the break in period.

If you just prefer the SUV thing that's fine, I'm just curious if you considered more practical non-SUV options (and what made the SUV win out).

bimmernut1,"chrisk03 said:Just browsing through the forums and saw this. I've always been a huge BMW fan, but stepped away after driving the AMG GLC43 this summer. Picked it up last weekend and couldn't be happier. I haven't had a chance to check out the new X3 M40i and will do so to see if I'm missing out, but the BMW wasn't available yet when I ordered the GLC43 and I wasn't too fond of the exterior vs the MB, especially with the 21's...I realize that's personal preference.Anyway, mine stickered for a tad under $68k and I was able to get about 12% discount from my local dealer. Not sure if a large discount would be available on the X3 yet, since it is so new. I passed on the Driver Assist Package (a tad regret) and Advanced Parking Assist Package (no regret), as well as Head Up Display (sunglasses pretty much knock it out) and Night Package (tried to add, but too late). You also get a free 1 day pass to the AMG Driving Academy-Performance Program ($1895 normally), which is cool and you have 4 tracks to choose from across the US. You are correct that MB doesn't throw in Maintenance, you have to purchase separately. I did not buy the maintenance plan as too many good independents in my area and will do it for cheaper.I also briefly looked at the Macan, but was ordered to stay under a certain budget and still went over slightly with the MB, so the Macan would have been even worse the way I wanted it. The Macan is also smaller with minimal rear seat and storage space vs the others. I did avoid driving it because it probably would have been lights out for me and I would have been in big trouble.. After the C&D November review of the Macan, SQ5 and GLC43, I felt like I couldn't go wrong with the MB, especially since I won't be doing any track days with the thing. I drove the SQ5, as well, and loved the interior with Active Display and Google, but the drive wasn't as good, IMO.I will say, the MB community doesn't seem to be as active and/or as large as the BMW community here, especially in the GLC43/63 forum over at MBWorld. You do get access as an AMG Owner to a MB run ""AMG Private Lounge"" website that seems more active, so that's pretty cool.Other than that, I'm still in the break-in period and only have about 95 miles on the 43, but happy to answer any questions, if you have any. Good luck with your search! :thumbup:Click to expand...Congratulations. After you put a few miles on the AMG, I would be interested in your perceptions. My local dealer didn't want to discount the MB very much. They have not yet come to the realization that the internet has made car buying a national (some might say international) marketplace. I'm not tied to any local dealer with the exception of warranty service. I live in Kansas; bought my 993 in San Antonio, my Turbo in Ohio, my M5 in Illinois, and my X3 in Minneapolis after a local dealer tried to add $400 in fees at the last minute.

I bought a set of Pirelli P zero A/S tires for $800 which is less than half the 21"" tire cost. I don't mind paying for better wheels or other things but I don't like wasting it.

hispeed4fun,"mastre said:Yep, have been considering it. Definitely an acquired taste. Practical, just not sure I'm willing to go that far for it. And it gains weight, so not as amazing of a proposition. On the wagon front, weight doesn't increase to such a great extent (~200 lb. less), and I happen to like the look quite a bit (IMO the best looking wagon of the very limited choices in the US). If the choices are 3GT & X3, I currently lean X3.P.S. Because I looked, the 3er Wagon has the same cargo space (w/in negligible margins) as a GLC/Macan (in broad terms, about a third less than the G01, or half that of a CR-V). Some claim that the G01 has better driving dynamics than the 3er Wagon, I find this hard to believe but will test drive to form my own opinion.Not in a big rush, hoping 2019 MY fixes it from the factory.Click to expand...My lease is up this winter and hoping the M wheel finds it way into the M40 because thats what i want to get.

I was also told that they can't order one because BMW is only taking orders for the 2019 model now and that it would cost 70-80 thousand to get one of those whereas the 2018 model I had priced out on BMW's website was about 69 thousand MSRP. Additionally they were willing to discount the 2018 model to the mid-60s, but couldn't find one with all the features I wanted at their dealership or elsewhere. They said they wouldn't provide any kind of discount on the 2019 if I ordered it. Are they messing with me? Can you really not order the 2018 model anymore this early in the year? Is the price really increasing that much and does BMW not negotiate price on ordered vehicles?","May 6, 2018"
zachp13,I ordered mine on March 29th and should be at the dealer shortly. There is no penalty for ordering the car. Most likely the dealership you talked to doesn***8217;t have anymore allocations for 2018 models. I would suggest taking to other dealerships. Greg Poland at pacific BMW is great.,"May 2, 2018"

After Hours,"I bought the 2018 X3 30i. Compared to your 2013 35i I think that you will find slightly slower acceleration, a little wider and larger vehicle with more room for people and stuff, a little more luxurious ride, a little better fuel economy, and at least equal and perhaps better handling. It also can get expensive with all of the electronic options. I love it. Even with the smaller engine it is faster than most of the vehicles on the road.

It really annoys me that the new BMWs are critiqued for having simplistic interiors, with their materials overlooked, and new audi interiors being complimented. I spent a whole day comparing cars at the audi dealer before buying my 540i, and the main thing I noticed on every vehicle was the lack of any leather on the door panels or at least a nicer soft touch material on the dash. Instead it was just hard and rough rubber and looked very cheap. Even on expensive models like the S4 (which was over $60K) the best material that was available, and had to be optioned, was leatherette with fake stitching. I really enjoy that with BMW whenever you option leather you get the stitched leather door panels as well and a nice soft touch dash. Its something very little, but overall it just makes the car feel even more special and luxurious (especially since I'm paying). Even my 04 BMW 330i has door panels with leather and stitching.

I know I'm busting your balls, but it's a BMW forum! We love our balanced I6s compared to the inferior, clattery V6!.3. It's possible that the 30i had variable sport steering and the M40i did not.

As the designated family trickster, it's conceivable that we could get 500 miles on a tank of gas.The all-season, non-RFT, square set-up tires will work year in cold weather and light snow, and last at least 50k miles. The wheels are relatively skinny, so they might be protected by the wider tires in curb encounters. Did I mention Frau Putzer's rough on cars?

Then I saw an F1 car blasting through shifts in millseconds and I said to my self that I wanted a transmission as close to that as I can get. After driving manuals for almost 30 years I found that they are cumbersome and offer unnecessary involvement, which some people equate to fun.

The regular x3 did not appeal to me at all.Sent from my iPad using Bimmerfest,"April 17, 2018"
Deinonych,Thanks. We pulled the trigger on the 2018 xDrive 30i with M Sport. My wife is the primary driver and didn't care about the additional HP on the M40i. Vehicle is in production as we speak - hope to take delivery in late May sometime.,"April 18, 2018"

All passengers unanimously voted in favor of the X5, in terms of comfort and seat quality (I only had Dakota leather in the X5 that too, napa would have been more luxurious. My X3 is equipped with leather.) Trunk and interior space is noticeably smaller. Cubby space in the X3 is very impressive, although glove and center console are smaller in comparison to the X5. I'm comfortably able to store my iPhone X in the 'cell phone area' (where properly equipped X3s have a wireless charger).Bigger Passengers:If you have a 6'1 passenger in the front, you can expect the front seat to be all the way back, which will make someone who is 5'5+ have their knees resting on the front seat. Also, if your front passenger is bigger (6'1, 280lbs+) you will ask him/her to move their arm out of the way to comfortably access the iDrive. This was not the case in the X5.Also, a passenger/driver of this height/weight will be uncomfortable in the front seat...the side bolsters make the seats very narrow.Smaller passengers:If you have smaller/normal sized (like me lol) passengers, then the side bolsters are not an issue. I'm 5'5, and my 5'11 buddy is able to sit very comfortably behind me.

And you activate it just by pressing the brake pedal a bit more before releasing it. It is convenient as you foot is on the brake pedal anyways. So there is no extra action required.Click to expand...Auto Hold is remembered in my X3. I turned it on once and it's been on every time I start the car since.","April 2, 2018"

This would also negate the need for a $1,000 damage deposit, although it's not refundable. My lease is for 45 months and I hear BMW is very strict on the condition of returned cars at lease end, so I'm thinking this might be worth it.The second thing is tire and rim protection ($1,500). Torn on this one because I bought it two or three times on previous cars and then never used it. Then I didn't buy it on the next two cars and got nails and other tire issues. I'm thinking those 21"" rims and tires will be expensive to replace or repair.Really not anxious to spend any more $ on this vehicle, but also don't want to be stupid about it.

cowboys5,Thx for the advice Jsy. I take pretty good care of my vehicles and roads aren't bad where I live just outside Toronto.

I suppose I can always slap on a set of used but still good tires for less than what they're asking. Still not quite sure.,"March 11, 2018"
Autoputzer,"Those protection packages are really insurance.On average, insurance is a losing proposition.

cowboys5,"Thanks for your thoughts on this, and really happy to hear someone else made the same colour choice as me!

karateboi87,"Autoputzer said:They have the same suspension, at least in the U.S. M Sport gets you bigger, performance tires if you want them... in the U.S. Dynamic dampers (adjustable shocks) are a $1000 option... in the U.S. You can get the non-M Sport with non-run-flat tires... in the U.S. Frau Puter's non-RFT-ed Luxury Line 30i started production yesterday.Go on BMW""s UK website to see how things sort out for cars in your market. If you going to see any snow or the temperatures will go below -5C where you live, you'd be better off with the 19"" wheels and all-season tires, unless you are willing to play for a second set of wheels and real winter tires.I like the mono-chromatic look of the M Sports. I don't like the dark gray rear bumper insert. I wish it was body colored. Also, I prefer bright trim around the side windows. But, in the U.S., the 30i M Sport is another $2200 and you can't get non-RFT's on it. Most the world gets an M steering wheel with the M Sport. But, because of the M steering wheels uses a different airbag, we don't get that here.Click to expand...What I don't get is whether the M sport has the identical suspension as the non-M sport version. The dealer tried to tell me yes (but obviously they could be BSing to make a sale), but I did compare VIN option codes between M and non M model. The M one gets a ""standard suspension"" code S225A while the non-M does not. So what ""standard suspension"" is this?","March 11, 2018"
karateboi87,"Autoputzer said:Here's an early price guide. It says that the 30i's all have the standard suspension (225), but you can upgrade to the Dynamic Damper Control (223) or Dynamic Handling Package (ZDH). The M40i's get the Sport Suspension (704) as standard, but you can upgrade to Adaptive M Suspension (2VF).So, in this rare case the car salesman is telling the truth.The non-M Sport Package 30i can be had with non-run-flat tires (25X). That should greatly improve the ride. Ordering the non-run-flats also gets you a free spare tire and jack. The price guide implies that you need to get the Premium Package (ZPP) in order to get the non-run-flats. But, the configurator onBMWUSA.comlets you add them without ZPP.The Dynamic Damper Control will allow you to manually choose a (sort-of) stiffness: Pappa Bear, Momma Bear, and Baby Bear. I have DHP of my 535i, and it was a life saver when I had the OE run-flat tires. With the run-flats, I left the car in Comfort +, a.k.a. ""Buick Mode."" I ****canned the run-flats for non-run-flats and now the car rides great in any mode.Frau Puzter's X3 is due in late this week or early next week. We ordered 25X.Click to expand...I think maybe I wasn't clear but you just confirmed the salesman was lying. The car he was describing was a 30i with M-sport package, and this particular car has no dynamic damper control or any other suspension upgrades. He was trying to claim the M-sport package has some kind of upgraded suspension. What I was describing above regarding the BMW option codes was that, if you look up an M-sport car's VIN, it'll show 225 ""standard suspension"" whereas a non-M-sport car will show nothing about suspension. I guess the conclusion is whether 225 shows on a VIN a car will still have the same suspension.","March 11, 2018"

shouldahadaV8,If your situation is one where you can wait the torque vectoring even if it uses the breaks is well worth it. Miss that from my x4 . It literally allows you to defy the laws of physics.

This car was great when I got it coming out of school, but I've always wanted a BMW and I am finally in a position where I can at least reasonably think about getting one!I live in the Boston area, so terrible, windy roads and snow / salt most of the year. I'm trying to decide between the X1 or the X3, since I do run into some situations for work where I would prefer some more cargo space over a sedan. I've done a ton of internet sleuthing over the past few weeks, but nothing has really explained the differences succinctly.Assuming the xDrive version of the X1, they seem to have similar options and packages available except for Dynamic Damper control. Is anyone able to recommend for or against that, given the roads around where I live are terrible?Finally, is the Executive Tier package the only way to get the digital instrument cluster in the X3?","February 16, 2018"

While the size comparisons may be a bit similar, there's is a clear quality/feature difference between the two.Originally I was considering the X4, but then I saw the new X3 and it wasn't even a debate anymore at that point.

I tried the sport seats in the X1 and even with the extended thigh support they were very uncomfortable because of the small size. For sure spend some time in the seats before deciding. They were the reason I started looking at the X3 along with the availability of the inline 6 engine. It is a WONDERFUL engine and gives a great driving experience.

scottatah,"Hi Everyone,I'm not sure if this is so much an owners choice question as it is a finance question. For anyone not aware, Owners Choice is an option in Canada that lets you finance a vehicle over a term with a balloon payment at the end that can either be financed again, or paid outright or whatever.Anyways, using theTHISfor reference (I wasn't smart enough to display it as a picture), I'm trying to understand the math.Presumably, $84035.71 (total purchase price including taxes) - $22000 (down payment) = $62035.71. Add 2.9% interest over 60mo ($4680.99) for a total amount paid of $66716.70My understanding is that this is then split up into two terms: initial 5yrs and balloon payment, however, the math doesn't work out for me. $66716.70 - $22530 (balloon) = $39505.71 for the first 5years. Divide that by 60 = $658.43/mo instead of the quoted which shows $762.56.Can anyone assist to help me with where I've gone wrong on the math?","February 15, 2018"
rounderman,"Not an expert on the program, but try thisStandard car loan on the amount financed 39505 for 60 months, any spreadsheet can do the math then add the balloon amount as an interest only loan so monthly that would be 22350 * .029/12 each month.

Thanks in advance!","February 14, 2018"
After Hours,"I like the dynamic dampers. If you hit a pot hole, before the front wheel has deflected all the way the rear shock has softened. Since the RFT tires are stiffer and harsher than the go-flat tires, I suspect that you will notice the improved ride more.As I have posted before, in my youth there were Koni adjustable shocks. As I understood it, there was a nut or bolt at the end that could be turned to stiffen the shock at the race track, and soften it for the ride home. Now that can be done on the move with a console switch. Winter is as hard on the roads in NY as it is here in MA. I think that you will appreciate the trick shocks, so I would say, get them.","February 13, 2018"

After Hours,"My last issue of Consumers Reports lists the X3 as best in its class. It gave an extremely high road test score to it, but the other high-scoring SUVs were an unlikely group: Subaru Forester, Chevrolet Traverse, and Audi Q7.I have had mine for just 500 miles, and will report when I have had it a little longer. My initial impression is like other posters: comfortable, great highway car, and amazing technology. It comes close to the gas mileage of my 3-series wagon. It is bulkier, so that I slow more on narrow city streets, but in return there is greater interior room. I can't keep myself from breaking in a new engine slowly, even though I know that that is no longer necessary. So I am driving slowly and still keeping up effortlessly with the fastest traffic on the roads that I drive. Also, I have yet to master all of the technology. When I know more, I will report again.","February 6, 2018"

I have 12 years no claims, 1 SP30 from 4 years ago (which they still want to know :-/) and two non-fault accidents along with a windscreen replacement (I bet they regret accepting that with the HUD windshield being what it costs).Anyhow, to my surprise, if I changed the car today they would actually GIVE ME BACK -£26.91.

jstein333,"Matty j said:Dark Graphite, Mocha Vernasca Leather, Aluminum TrimConvenience, Driving Assistance, Dynamic Handling, Luxury, Premium and Executive Packages.Trailer Hitch, Run Flat TiresFor context, I am coming out of a 2011 535xi. I have also owned a 2002 X5, a 2003 330xi, and a 328xi (all with 6 cylinder engines). The X3 exceeds all of my expectations. I was a bit concerned coming out of the 6 cylinder, but the 4 cylinder is more than adequate for my needs. After the first week, at 350 miles of combination city/highway driving, my average mpg is 31.5 in Comfort Mode. I will venture into Sport and Adaptive Modes after break in.The technology in the X3 makes me wonder why I waited so long to get a new BMW. The Executive Tier displays and the 6.0 iDrive are far superior to the 2011 535. Voice recognition is incredible. I simply said navigate to"" and it initiated the destination without a question or hiccup. The navigation is top notch. It zooms in automatically at turns and intersections and also slows through the touch screen to move or zoom the map. I thought the controller touch pad would be finicky but it works and can be most useful. Everyone talks about how gimmicky the gesture controls are, but I love them and found them flawless. This is my first heads up display, and it is unbelievable. I can't get over how much I love the display of the speed limit. I never knew before how fast I drove on my everyday routes.Quiet, quiet quiet! The acoustic glass really works. The comfort of the X3 far exceeds that of my 535 and handles better as well. To me, the Dynamic Package was worth the cost. The Brakes are the best brakes that I haver had. The variable sport steering is better than I expected. With the 535, the steering was too heavy when parking, but just right on the highway. With the X3, the steering is perfect at all times.Little things that make the car better. The seat thigh and bolster adjustments and thicker padding on the arm rests (not to mention the cool ambient lighting) are among those items. I love the size of the panoramic moonroof and the anthracite headliner ties the interior all together.I went with the run flat tires because I hated the elevated cargo floor with the spare. To my amazement, with the 19"" gorgeous wheels, the Bridgetones are the most comfortable and quiet run flats out of the past three BWMWs.The $350 spent on the Luxury Package was well spent. The Sensetec dashboard is so nice. What an improvement from the 535. But, the outside trim is what I really love. Yeah, I like chrome. What I didn't like in the photos of the base X3 was the fake silver-like embellishments. However, with the Luxury Package, those embellishments are more titanium-like topped off with a strip of chrome. The embellishments become a nice transition to the Dark Graphite. The trim around the trailer hitch is just the titanium so it doesn't scream ""trailer hitch""),I was somewhat surprised that with all of these packages that the rear seats were not heated, but then again I don't often have rear seat passengers (the grandkids don't count). I did not want the Driving Assistance Plus Package. The Driving Assistance Package is perfect. The blind spot and lane departure warnings are just right and can be individualized. I worried that the base entertainment system was a mistake, but for my (spousally deaf) hearing I am quite pleased. The hard drive capability for the ""Music Collection"" is better than what I have at home. Come on, the car gives you weather in whatever your location is and will give you the news.

The X5 frankly doesn't have a whole lot more room inside than the X3.But if sportiness and driver connection *really* matter to you, the only option is to test drive the X3 and its competition and see which model really connects with your id.

I have it on my vehicle and IMHO is worth the price.From your list, I'd delete leather, executive or premium packages and order cold weather and technology packages (because of the heads up display, which is great for long distance driving directions). If you are planning to have snow tires, I'd recommend going with a smaller size and width rim to improve traction. Relative to color, I'd prefer silver or white because they don't show dirt spots so much.","November 27, 2017"

I am kind of stuck as of right now because noone has made front all seasons for the 21s.

A lot of us didn't custom order our car, we didn't see the order guide or the sign the order sheet. We just felt with BMW's reputation and their pride on their M badge, we can trust them. lol we were so wrong.","December 29, 2017"

ND40oz,"Sor has a pretty good write up on the different steering wheel/airbag options across the various markets when he did his swap. The issue is the airbags between the M Sport and Sport steering wheels are a different design, so if they didn't have the 3 stage airbag available for the M Sport steering wheel but did for the Sport steering wheel and the NA market required the 3 stage, than they had no choice but to use the Sport steering wheels.http://x3.xbimmers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1444289","December 29, 2017"
iliveinhope,"Not sure that's the reason though. I read SOR's post on the airbags. the newest G30 has both sports and M Sport wheel variants. based on that, BMW either can fit a 3 stage into a M Sport steering wheel or it is OK in NA to sell new cars with either dual or 3 stage airbags. But in all seriousness, I am pretty sure a engineering giant like BMW can figure out how to fit anything in anything :rofl:","December 29, 2017"
Miles Calfee,Don?t expect a M Sport Steering Wheel in your new M40i. Saw a new one today with a standard wheel. My dealer didnt know why so I contacted BMW?s genius line. They know and are expecting appropriate blow back but some (not so) genius in the USA didn?t spec the steering wheel in the M40.(Help push BMW into making a retro-fit. Call 844 443-6487 and complain),"January 16, 2018"
ND40oz,"I imagine it comes down to the crash testing certification and what airbag variants can be installed in certain markets, if the X3 was only tested with the 3 stage, than they may have to stick to it.Also, if you look at the box for part number 32307855725 that arciga18 ordered to get the 3 stage airbag, it was made in Germany. It certainly could be NA supply issue and they're currently only available on the German produced vehicles.","December 30, 2017"
SmoWilly,"Like I have said before, all this talk about crash testing, NA regulations and other incompatible airbags is frankly BS. Consider the fact that yu can order any current BMW with the M sport package or get an actual M vehicle with an M steering wheel. The new X2 even has the new M steering wheel for NA. Any talk about shortages is also highly unlikely since all of these cars including non NA X3s get the wheel.","December 30, 2017"
JSY,"BobBass said:All of this steering wheel discussion made me take a close look at my '15 xDrive28i wheel.Never noticed there are two ""blanks"" on the left side as there apparently are on the '18 non-M wheel. Never knew what I was missing.This has probably been brought up before, but the left side on the M wheel has two more functions.I have no idea if any of the other packages affect whether the non-M wheel has those two extra functions. Probably not.BTW, the Accord wheel has SEVEN functions on the left as opposed the FIVE on the M and THREE on the standard X3.Click to expand...The buttons on both the non-M wheel and the M-wheel are the same in the 2018 X3, and you will get the appropriate buttons for your spec. It's not a function of whether or not you get the M-sport wheel. On the left side, the 2015 X3 steering wheel had two empty spaces where there would be buttons unless you had Active Cruise Control, then you would have all 5 buttons and the fly wheel. In our 2018 X3, if you have Active Cruise Control, and Lake Keeping Assistant, then you will also have all 5 buttons and the fly wheel.","December 30, 2017"

JSY,"Okay, true - I was comparing it to my old F25 but that is kinda of the natural comparison - comparing the new X3 to the old X3. Okay, I admit that it certainly isn't the best fake leather I've ever felt, but the stitching adds to the aura I think and on the door, where it is more stiff, it actually reminds me a little of the Dakota leather in my F25. I've never had Sensatech seats before, so actually this is my first experience with Sensatech anything and my impression of it was just that it was better than the plastic they used in my last X3.","December 31, 2017"

BobBass,"Excellent reasoning. I went thru that decision process as well.The biggest reason I went with the 30i was the smoother ride. I don't know if the M40i I drove had the adaptive suspension, but when I hit the ""smooth highway"" portion of the test drive, with the 30i , it was noticeably smoother-riding. At this stage in my life, that takes priority over better handling (which I'd never take advantage of) and sub 5 sec. 0-60 times.","December 30, 2017"
xx,The 30i is actually plenty fast enough and saves gas. I picked the 30i because it's for wife. She said she wanted lots of features... so that automatically means the exec package/option must be in there too. They don't have a bright yellow or bright orange color for her... well.. this fancy blue will be the closest one (she doesn't want anything in the white-thru-black shades).

My current car has the electronic shocks, and I ordered them again.

nosnoop,"One of the serious flaw of my current BMW's blind spot detection is that when the warning triangle light is off, you cannot tell whether the blind spot is clear with no traffic, or the car is below the minimum speed and therefore the detection system is not active!Not sure if X3 is the same. Looking through the X3 owner's manual, it seems to be the same.How can they allow this? For my Mercedes, there could be no mistake - one glance and you know if the system is off / not active, or if the blind spot is clear.","December 31, 2017"
JSY,"nosnoop said:I don't think that's the case. Lane departure warning uses the camera to detect lane markings, while the blind spot detection uses the radar to detect vehicle presence. Could be that the minimum speed for both are close, and you see both activating at similar speed. But I think they are two independent systems - though X3's side collision detection system would use both systems simultaneously.Even if there is dashboard indication, it would be too awkward to check (if you remember to check) both the dashboard icon and the side mirror warning lights when trying to change lane. Is BMW trying to save a few pennies by installing a single color instead of multi-color blind spot warning lights like in the Mercedes (red-amber-green) where status can be immediately shown?Click to expand...You're right - after I wrote that I thought about it and then as I was driving this afternoon - it didn't make sense. The Lane departure warning indicator would be off and the blind side would still work if over a certain speed but without lanes for the system to detect. So, yes - definitely independent.Not sure, but BMW has always as far as I know have one color for the indicator. I never thought of it as a cost saving measure. It's just how it's implemented I guess. I think MB's system is a bit more atypical than the norm.","December 31, 2017"

I built a 30i M Sport and M40i with the Executive package and the price difference is $5,250. If the more aggressive engine and suspension change is a positive for you, it will probably only cost you ~$2k.

SpeedyK,"Last time when I compared compatible equipped 30i and M40i, the price difference is roughly 6-8 K$. However, the M40i has a slightly more aggressive body style, more sportier suspension, much stronger engine without sacrifice much on fuel efficiency and a step closer to its true M variant, to me, I think it worth the extra $.

I would not have bought this with track intentions...better cars for that.Since I use this as a commuter, family errands, school runs and occassional demos at the driving school I instruct, they work fine. I guess I grew up in a time when most cars had bench seats and I was still able to drive fast, hug corners and have fun without agressve bolsters. My Ford Edge Sport has no real bolsters and I can hold my own in the canyons of Colorado.","December 18, 2017"

If the engine was running dry or close to it, there is irreparable damage that will be revealed in the future. A good way to test this is with a Blackstone Labs oil sample analysis, although because you only have 1700 miles, particles that would be found in the analysis from the initial break in could interfere. I would give the oil analysis a go anyway because they are pretty good at Blackstone and they can probably tell you some important stuff for $28.","December 17, 2017"

So I've been examining the X3's of every flavor. The cargo area is HUGE!! You probably can fit a golf cart back there!!,"December 14, 2017"
atticus1,I also have h u d in my 328ix and will never have a vehicle without it. I agree that the x5 is too large. We have a Macan S and that is the perfect size. But the tech in my new x3M40 blows away the technology in the Macan. The Macan is my wife's car and the X3 will be my first non sedan. I only drove it home from the dealer so far and it did handle very well but what a transition from 35 years of sedans.,"December 15, 2017"

Removing the plastic cover behind the mirror was relatively easy. Unplugging the connector took a bit of fiddling but it eventually came out. (I got one of those LED lights in a headband at Home Depot and it definitely helped.) I would have liked to verify the exact wires as being the +12 V switched and ground but more than one thread addressing this subject identifies the brown/green wire in the middle of the bottom row as the +12 V switched and the brown/black wire in the top right as the ground and my multimeter's posts were too thick to insert into the holes in the back of the male plug so I relied on that information. So I inserted the posts into the respective holes adjacent to those wires. And...nothing. The posts were inserted completely and did not come out easily but apparently were not making contact. To verify the continuity of the MirrorTap I touched its posts to the respective connections on a 9-volt D-cell battery and my detector powered up. For some reason they were not making connection to the wires in the plug. Then as I attempted to reinsert them one more time the MirrorTap's ground wire broke off at the point where it was soldered to the post. The wires are not too heavy a gauge and this seems likely to happen if you're removing and reinserting it in order to get a connection. So I will call them tomorrow and see what to do. I thought about getting a couple of quick splice connectors and just splicing them to those wires as the solder connection on the red wire looks pretty flimsy and probably will not withstand much more fiddling.Click to expand...Interesting.

Canhouter,Aim for 20% discount from MSRP and your monthly payment will be 458 without any money down and at money factor of 0.00192 plus taxes and fees.

Like the new G30, this should provide a nice stitched leatherette look to the upper dash (and perhaps door tops?) Leather dashes are really nice, but I do wonder about durability. I own two such cars -- a 2017 M3 and a 2013 Porsche -- both have dashes in great shape, but my cars are garage queens. The Sensatec hopefully will provide the nice look and improved durability. I suspect the Sensatec dash will be optional for $500 or so on the non-M G01s, like on the 5 series sedans.-- The tires have gone taller, not wider. Instead of the F25 245/45R-19s, the G01 has 245/50R-19s , along with optional 20s and 21s. But even the latter stay with 245 front and 275 rear.-- Two available rear view cameras? 3AG is standard, and ZX2 is available in a couple of the optional packages. Note, though, that option codes beginning with the letter ""Z"" are BMWUSA-derived and sometimes duplicate BMWAG codes. For instance, in Big BMWspeak, the code for M sport is 337, but BMWUSA uses codes like ZMP etc.Click to expand...is it true they are being produced without m sport steering wheel? shortage?","November 24, 2017"

alex md,"twssas said:My dealer finally got a X3 M40, so we did a test drive yesterday. Here are some of my thoughts;Just to preface, I currently have a 2011 e70 X5 35d. Love it. Love the power/torque.Especially love the heavy hydraulic steering. But after 7.5 years, I think I'm done messing with the diesel fuel, adblue, etc. Looking to go to a gas vehicle.Wife drives a 2015 535 MSport. Great car, but personally I do not care for the steering. Just doesnt do it for me.So, the X3 M40 had 20 inch wheels. The entire vehicle was very nice. Fit and finish looked excellent. Wife and I split up a 30 mile drive up, some street driving, and interstate. Steering, was much improved over the F10 535. Not as good as my old E70, but very, very good. Power was very good, even though thisi vehicle has about 360 foot lbs of torque, it seemed when you punched it on the interstate, it would downshift. In all fairness, I'm used to the torque on my E70, and it just goes. The E70 torque is just about 50 foot lbs more the the X3, but nevertheless, the X3 performed great. Sport seats were verycomfortable.Quiteimpressed overall.Then, we drove a 2018 X5 35i, Msport with 22"" wheels. Nice ride. At 300 HP, not as ""peppy"" as the X3 but more than adequate. Again, missed my torque of my E70. I was also quite happy with the steering with the X5, but wonder if it had to do with the 22 inch wheels. My plan would be 19"" on either the X3 or X5. Very nice ride with the Multi contour seats.BMW has done a great job with the X3. In some ways the cabin, electronics, and other features seemed to be nicer in the new X3 than the 2018 X5. For example, the dash in the X3 is either leather, or faux leather, and X5 is hard plastic. Lane warning light on X5 is on body of side mirrors (hard to see), while X3 warning light is in mirror. Very nice change. Wife f10 lane change warning is in body of mirror also, and I really do like what they did with the X3's location better. Also, appears the X3 controls have ceramic buttons, X5 does not. I could go on, but you get the idea.Is the X5 worth $10k more? The X3 from a dimension standpoint, while smaller, isn't that much smaller. Oh, and the X5 had the Msport Steering wheel, X3 just the sport steering wheel.I have some decisions to make. I love the feel of the X5, but am really impressed with this X3 as well. Even though the dimensions are not ""that much smaller"" in the X3, you can still easily tell the size difference in the cabin. I really do not need the additional space of the X5, but you know how it is, when you are just ""used to something"", and make a change. Its all relative.

You mention the 10k difference. A fully loaded x3 is approaching 64k msrp. You can get 2018 X5s for up to 13% off making the price pretty close (I am assuming the M40's is too new to get any decent discount?).

simplemoe,"Hi all,I'm heavily considering a move to an X3, upgrading from a 2011 335i (I'm at the time of my life where I need an SUV). I test drove both the 30i and the M40i, as well as a 2018 Q5 and SQ5.For me, the biggest smile factor came from the M40i - if I am going to put this much down for a car, I need to love to drive it, not just use it as a tool to take me from one place to another (hence the 335i).However, the SO's complaint when test driving was the comfort, or lack thereof. Her preference for the ride was the Q5 and even the SQ5. I didn't mind the audis but I didn't ""love"" them, the interface for the entertainment is not intuitive, and I really don't want to have to give up my M\\ hat!I'm interested to hear if anyone else has had a similar dillemma, and if going with a 19"" tire would be seen to help with this?Thanks!","November 14, 2017"

If your SO finds the ride in the M40i a little hard try and find one with the adaptive suspension to test. In the Gen 2 X3 (my version) the adaptive suspension, in addition to providing a sport mode for better handling, provides a more compliant ride in comfort mode than the standard suspension. I'm assuming the same is true for the new X3.Marty","November 13, 2017"
beware_phog,"BobBass said:Took me a bit to figure out what ""SO"" was...I've commented on this before; at this stage in my life, a more comfortable ride takes precedence, so I'm going with the 30i which does ride significantly smoother than the M40i. It won't have the head-snapping acceleration or body twisting cornering of the M40i, but will be the best of both worlds for ME. It'll be loaded up with all the ""major"" options including DHP.I didn't drive the Audis so it wouldn't be fair for me to comment on them.As far as the 19"" tire goes, in my experience with an '04 Maxima going from 18"" to 17"", it did take away some of the extreme jarring from bad roads, but not by much. I wouldn't count on it.I'm getting the 698M 19"" wheels with the M Sport Pkg (which still has the standard suspension) on the 30i.

I think I'll be going with the all season tires, as opposed to the performance tires, but no non run-flats were an option on the configurator (sp). It seems that the M Sport package on the 30i, or the M40i does not have that as an option. As such, I may have to chat with the sales guy about this to see if there are any options here....Thinking about it further, it is very likely that the comfortable ride, even in the SQ5 with 21"" rims is likely to do with the tyres not being run-flat.","November 14, 2017"

Neither of us are big people but the seats didn't work for either of us. She didn't like the end of the seat (extended or retracted) and I hated the left and right bolsters on the bottom of the seat. It was pushing my legs together and I like to ride with a more relaxed position. We both thought the rear seat was too much of a flat bench.However, I'm left a bit confused as to whether there are one or two front seat options.

RaslDasl,"BobBass said:I was ready to place an order for an '18 today and wanted to check out the seats one more time before pulling the trigger.Their M40i had non-ventilated sport seats and I have to agree with ""428iAR"" that the side bolsters in the seat BOTTOM are bothersome, at least for my WIDE BUTT. The upper bolsters are adjustable and are OK in the widest setting.They have a 30i non-M Sport pkg. there with ventilated seats and for ME, they were just about right; kinda similar to my '15. The side seat BOTTOM bolsters that are annoying in that M40i are much flatter and more comfortable. As ""Diver624"" added, these seats do not have adjustable seat back side bolsters, but they fit me OK.What's confusing is both model ordering guides list ""#481 Sport Seats."" if you order the M Sport Pkg. on the 30i, it lists that same ""#481 Sport Seats."" Nowhere does it indicate that when you order ""4FH Ventilated Front Seats"" that they will be like the ones that are in the 30i I referenced in the above paragraph. My salesman and I spent a lot of time on this issue, we spoke with the ""top"" BMW Genius there and he wasn't sure, either.For the record, I plan to order a loaded 30i with the M Sport Pkg and Ventilated Seats. At this point he is not sure that means I will get the more comfortable (for me) flatter seats with non-adjustable upper side bolsters. The more I think about, this is a deal-killer unless I lost ~50 lbs in the next 6 weeks or so, which obviously AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!I would have placed the order today but when he went to the lease connect (or whatever) website, when he inserted some info, it just sat there ""grinding away."" I couldn't stick around because I had a gig to play. Going back Monday morning to finalize the deal.The only good thing about this seat hassle is it appears that I can hopefully ""have my ventilation and comfortable seats, too."" It NEVER happens that way. Everything I ever order/buy is a compromise in some way. In fact, I would actually prefer to have the 6 cylinder engine with the standard suspension, but that cannot be done at this point.Click to expand...Did the ventilated seats still have the thigh extension?

He confirmed that the actual configuration algorithm, not justBMWUSA.com'sfiguration, will not let me order non-RFT's with the M Sport package on the 30i.His first suggestion was that I work with my dealer to have non-RFT's retrofitted on the car/truck when it come is. I explained that doing that would cost either the dealer or me $1200. I told him that I would eat the $1200 if non-RFT's were not available on the X3 30i. But, since they are available, just not with M Sport package, I'm likely going to dig in over this.I explained that this is going to be Frau Putzer's car, and she'd be almost as happy with a Honda or a Hyundai, and that she really likes the looks of the Audi Q5 and wants to test drive one. I went on to explain that buying an X3 would to a large degree be a loyalty purchase from BMW (because they did the right thing to resolve a big problem I had with a previous BMW) and from Sansing BMW in Pensacola (whose service department has not disappointed me is 15 years of doing business with them).The BMW specialist eventually realized that this is a real easy problem to fix and that not fiving it would likely cause BMW to loose a long-time customer. He didn't have the authority to fix this (change the configuration algorithm to allow ""25X"" with ZMP). He said that his job is to prepare a ""package"" about my complaint that will get sent up to BMW management. I told him that I can wait a few months to replace Frau Putzer's current car. I lastly told him I hope this gets resolved and that I don't end up sending BMW another letter with a picture of Frau Putzer's new Q5, along with a copy of the title (no liens) and a cancelled check I used to pay for it.With the demise of the M Sport steering wheel from the M Sport package on the X3 30i, the only place you will see an ""///M"" on the car would be on the M Sport-specific wheels (19"" 698M's, or 20"" 699M's).

But, as soon as the G01 30i's start showing up any leftover F25 28i's can likely be had for maybe 25% below MSRP.There's a lot of truth to the adage about not buying the first year production. I'm taking the risk, though, mainly because of the aforementioned problems with the F25.I'm psych'ed about the G01 offering non-RFT's and a mini-spare as no-cost options with the Premium Package. That will save me about $1000 in tire-replacement costs. Also, I can order one without a sunroof, saving another $1000 or so. Frau Putzer hasn't opened the sunroof on her current car in years. I haven't opened mine since April.There's a guy on the F30 board who goes previous model year leftover shopping and leases his cars. He ends up driving a lot of car for the money he spends. He has to put some time (shops multiple dealers) and effort (intense price negotiations) into this, but it seems to be one of his hobbies.

michail71,"Autoputzer said:Yeah, quad circular headlights are one of the historic BMW styling elements (at least in the U.S.). BMW offered dual headlights on lower trim levels outside the U.S. in the past (e.g. the E21). But, most people who buy BMW's don't know this, and are mesmerized by new, cool looking stuff.Frau Putzer's not really a car person. Yet, it's odd to what little styling things on cars attract her attention and sometimes become important: ""shark fin"" GPS/XM antennas, trapezoidal exhaust tips integrated into the rear bumper, the Chevy Impala insignia, the big red ""G M C"" grill badges on GMC's, etc. From this, I could see how the non-circular angel eyes on the G01 would attract positive attention from soccer mom's, the core customer base for crossover SUV's.I think the styling of the G01 is a big improvement over the F25. I especially didn't like the headlight lenses on the pre-LCI F25. They made the car look sad, or like it had its feelings hurt. The headlight lenses were fixed on the LCI F25, but the F25 nose still seemed weak or car-like. They've really beefed up the face on the G01. I didn't like the drooping style line along the side of the F25. That's gone, too. Finally, there were abrupt angles of the rear door and cargo area side windows. Those lines have been smoothed out on the G01. Now, the corner and turns of the window edges are smooth.Click to expand...Lol, a great read. Frau Putzer sounds like a great woman.I remember being a young teen back in the 80s and being captivated by the quad circular headlights. I guess I'm being nostalgic.

I suppose 30 years from now people will be looking for whatever it is going on in the front of Lexus cars.I still think the latest headlight design looks a bit sleepy.

Doug Huffman,"Rear biased xDrive cars have no torque sent to the front at low parking lot speeds and above some high freeway speed. While DTC is commanding torque split is variable. While the transfer clutch is locked up the maximum torque is equal to the traction force of each axle, and at the limit the split is 40% front/60% rear due to weight transfer and the height of the car's center of mass/gravity.As to the causes and cures of steering balance, one must familiarize oneself with BMW's use of the Kamm Circle of traction force.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_forces","July 1, 2017"
Doug Huffman,"Power, here horsepower, is the product of moment (and torque is a moment of length and force) and rate (here radians per second expressed as RPM).The engine power versus RPM and torque versus RPM are far removed from what happens where the rubber meets the road literally. F=ma is the basic relation, but the Force is not simple traction force once the interface slips from static to dynamic friction.When I went diesel twenty years ago, the aphorism was ""Buy horsepower, drive torque.""

pix335i,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rDqzjaPY0The BMW X3 was the car that launched the mid-size SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle) segment in 2003. The all-new BMW X3 is set to write the next chapter in this success story with an even more striking, dynamic design language, powerful yet also efficient drive systems and luxurious appointments. Like all members of the successful X family, it blends standout driving qualities on any terrain with unrestricted everyday usability.The third generation of the BMW X3 follows in its predecessors' tyre tracks by combining rugged off-road looks with a sporting presence. The potent dynamic intent of the new BMW X3 is highlighted by a chunky kidney grille and foglamps featuring a hexagonal design for the first time on a BMW X model.The interior of the new BMW X3 displays unbeatable fit and finish, material quality, and is even classier and more luxurious than its predecessor.Read All About the All New BMW X3 Now","June 30, 2017"

Each kidney grill seems to be the size of a watermelon, creating the face of a person with overly large nostrils. The kidney grills go down about 45% of the front of the car! I'd like to meet the German that said ""Hmm yes zis vill be very gute for za new masta creation."" It is atrocious!","June 30, 2017"

It needs to look big and tough, so Muffy the soccer mom will feel safe.The pre-LCI's F25's ""face"" looked sad and weak, with the parallelogram headlight assemblies drooping toward the grill. The F25 LCI improved the look of the headlights, though.","June 26, 2017"

RaslDasl,"Depends on what you call loaded. My 2016 X3 35i with all but 3 options stickered at $62k.

Considering this is now a “baby” m it would be safe to assume at a minimum the bump will be $5k. The competition from Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar and now Volvo will keep them from raising the base price on the 30i too much. With the way the Macan is selling BMW may find more breathing room at the top end. I would not expect less than $65k loaded.Sent from my iPad using Bimmerfest","June 27, 2017"

I was looking for sth from 2018 or newer with no more than 20k miles. Probably best for peace of mind to go for a sale from a BMW approved dealer so that I get their warranty? Used prices seem to be usually around £38k.An extra that is absolutely necessary is the adaptive suspension is my understanding. Is there anything else you’d recommend?

In terms of other extras I have - H&K speakers, tinted rear glass, acoustic glass (great extra!), folding side mirrors, lumbar support and space saver wheel (so as you can drive on non RFTs knowing you have a spare!).In terms of warranty - I have just taken out BMW approved extended warranty at £500 for year.

Flat-Patch,"I own a 21 plate, pre-LCI facelift. In summary, they're a fantastic bit of kit, but with two serious flaws, namely the firm suspension and lack of exhaust note. The latter is easily remedied, with a Remus or Akrapovic back box or system, but they start at £3k! The firm suspension is something you live with, and has got better since fitting Michelin PS4's (the OEM Conti's are garbage). The engine, box and build quality though, go some way to justify the price. They're bloody quick, stop well, handle fine (considering the mass), easily consume a family and furry friends, and not that common. Oh and until very recently, you could also get them on 2.9% APR PCP's, making them significantly cheaper on a monthly basis, than some of their direct rivals. ","April 15, 2022"

Its very fast, lots of space and not super expensive to run as insurance was like £700, full tank about £90-£110 and only do about 5k miles a year.I would be tempted by an LCI in the future as an M3 touring will be £900-£1k a month car even with a big deposit where my x3m is about £500pm.Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54 GTEYE said: Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54 ","April 15, 2022"

J-P,"Article is dumb - of course it's not as good as an M3. And there's no view as to whether it's any better than rivals (apart from the F-Pace SVR), but having owned a few JLR products, I'm never going back there. Terrible quality and generally shocking service.Also, having just bought one and having owned an X3 M40i before it, I would say that this is a superior car to the X3 M40i - yes it's quicker (a LOT quicker) but it also handles better, makes less road noise on bad surfaces and although people complain about it having a firm ride, I've no idea what they are talking about - the ride is absolutely fine. The GLC 63 AMG S i drove a few years ago had a far worse ride (but did sound epic). I notice that the test car had Continental Sport Contact tyres, mine has the Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S, not sure if that makes a difference or not? But mine both handles and rides really well.I did like the creamy smoothness of the X3 M40i but this car sounds fine too! Better than the Macan Turbo I drove but sure not as good as the GLC 63 AMG S. It doesn't handle as well as the Porsche but it's not a million miles off and I paid nothing like £90k for mine (and wouldn't have). My car was considerably less than that with options.Edited by J-P on Friday 15th April 16:55 Edited by J-P on Friday 15th April 16:55 ","April 15, 2022"

Ignoring the pain of actually getting one I know where my money would be going (or even a Macan S which is more than £10K cheaper again)IMO the Macan is a pretty old design its underpinnings are from a gen 1 Q5. i would also say its not as practical. I would like to see a Macan GTS specced with the same options as a X3m comp for a fair comparison. Also lets not forget a Macan Turbo wouldn't see which way a X3M comp went let alone a GTS. 130R said: ,"April 17, 2022"

GrantD5,"How's it going people? It's been a while since I have posted on here.Some may know, I was doing Uber driving and I have a VW Jetta for that but through lockdown I stopped and the car went to my Mum as I barely used it! Anyway I had a moped and I was doing Uber Eats etc for a while in London and it has been 1 year already. The bike sold yesterday and it was time to get another car. I will be going back to Uber very soon just waiting on TFL to pull their finger out of their backsides.Anyway, I sold the Ford Transit as I just had no use or the van anymore, just as the van was in a perfect working state ha.Today I drove 90 miles to Kettering and purchased this! 2004 BMW X3 3.0 Petrol 4 Wheel Drive. Pulled out the iPhone for some photos! Nice foggy day.While browsing on and off recently I noticed the market for the 6 cylinder autos tended to be 2.5i 4wd and 3.0i rear wheel drive. I had a 3.0i RWD lined up to go and see and I had one last look before leaving today and found this! I'm not sure how common the the 3.0i 4WD are but I never really noticed many and I was debating between going for the 4wd and slower or RWD and faster. But this is the best of both.Anyway the car drove faultlessly, but the EML came on - quick phone call with the home dealer and had the explanation of plugs and coils changed recently and the EML comes on sometimes??? So some digging in to that needed but the car was driving fine so I wasn't to phased. Also the airbag light come on as I pulled up at home, assuming its the occupancy sensor similar to E46 niggles.But apart from the the remote locking works, on one key at least think one may need a battery. All windows go up & down, the displays all work and are not pixelated, it has the locking nut, it has MOT, it has some history and it seems to just work. It has a CD player stereo and 6CD changer in the arm rest but it needs to go. I'd like a screen set up in the dashboard cubbyhole like on some models.My only pain with the 4WD was wanting to get the X5 wheels that I had on the X1 also but the rears are wider so far as I know that's no good for 4WD and need a square set up?Not sure what the overall plans are just nice to be in a nice enough daily car that's going to kill the wallet on petrol. At least it is ULEZ compliant and I can drive in the the zone without being charged an arm and a leg.Any advice / heads up please let me know! I know it's not the most exciting car but I have had an itch for one for a while now but while wanting X5 wheels. So I have to figure that now. But hopefully some updates soon regarding the EML at least. ","December 17, 2021"

GrantD5,"So first kind of update.I ordered a scanner from Amazon yesterday and it arrived today. Has pretty good reviews and only £25.00. Good enough to keep in the car for personal use at least.If anyone wants to the link of the one I used it is - https://amzn.to/3FrkIBDOrdered this due to the EML being on. So got to scanning and it flashed up the following.And one extra screen I found that I don't really understand, if anyone can shed some light that would be great.Moving on, I have been reading some 330i / 530i threads online and it seems a common replacement for the M54 engines can be the DISA valve.Here is a copy and paste of some issues that can arise when yours is faulty (for those that might not know)"" The symptoms of this fault are very obvious; there is a rattling noise coming from the DISA valve, SES light is lit and getting a lean mixture fault or rough running at idle. Displaying DTC codes and a loss in low end torque. There may be a rattling, buzzing or clicking noise coming from the engine. Fault codes: lean condition(P1083, P1085), front oxygen sensor lean (P1090, P1092) oxygen sensor slow response (P1087, P1089) and cylinder misfire (P0311-P0316) fuel control mixture lean (bank 2 sensor 1) and p0174 system too lean, showing? ""So that pretty much matches my issues.So I have ordered one for £64.99 and will pay my friend to fit it for me, I don't want my hands dirty haha. Looks like a nice bit of kit and they have their own install guide video.It removes the faulty plastic unit setup and replaces it with a billet aluminum setup.Anyway, I have started my pence per mile table that I have used previously and will get that updated soon once I pay for the part to be fitted.The dealer has agreed to pay half the bill which I am happy with just to get it over and done with, I am happy with the car apart from this issue so it will be nice to carry on driving.MOT history also states it has an oil leak so will start looking in to that and make sure its kept topped up in the mean time.Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 ","December 19, 2021"

Basically a jacked-up 3-series platform (identical underneath to the 4wd E46s that the US market got), with a slightly taller body.The interiors, particularly the dash plastics, are pretty low-rent - but they are excellent VFM. helix402 said: willmagrath said: ","December 20, 2021"
C70R,"The DISA valve failing should be VERY obvious, with a pronounced tapping/rattling from the inlet manifold on idle. You can test for it by disconnecting power to the valve's solenoid while the engine is running, which should make the noise stop - there's a good YT video showing how to do that.Your EML issues are likely to be linked to sensor of some sort. O2 and MAF sensors are the most common culprits.Also, don't rule out a tear in the intake trunk (from the airbox to the inlet manifold), which lets a load of unmetered air in and causes the car to run poorly. Easy to check, cheap and simple to replace. ","December 20, 2021"

You can check the vacuum under the oil cap with the engine running to give yourself a good idea of the CCV health.Remove the cap, and place your hand over the hole - a slight sucking feeling (and small change in idle) is normal, but strong suction suggests that the CCV has had it.Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 Jhonno said: Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 ","December 20, 2021"

But thought nothing much of it and wanted to wait until after the DISA valve was replaced, so we will start there.Ordered and X8R DISA valve kit and it was a very nice piece of kit!But on the day of going to get it fitted, the car wouldn't start. I had left an iPhone lead plugged in over night in the 12v plug that had a red light shining all night and I thought this must of just trickled the battery down enough.This got left a couple of days now as I was busy with work etc and this is kind of a second car. Anyway a couple of days later, I jump started the car and it worked fine so I took it for a spin around the block. Later that evening I took it to another friends too have the DISA valve fitted.All was good, the car started and I drove home and it drove better with the new valve in place.I went to the car in the morning to take it to work, NOTHING. Again this got left a couple of days, tested the battery and it was on the orange light at 12v and it was a 5-6 year old Bosch unit, but because it started up when jumping I decided to buy a new battery. Couple of days later and £140 later I jump started the car and took it to Halfords and had a new Yuasa battery fitted.New battery in and the car started, just. Anyway, I had some time to kill and went for some break with with my mother before heading to work, came out of McDonalds and NOTHING the car wouldn't start. The car was recovered and dropped a couple miles back home.I had some recommendations for the earth straps which I have bought now (still not fitted just yet), but tried to start the car with the car earthed with a jump lead with no luck. These are going to be changed soon anyway as they are cheap enough and appear to be problematic.With the new battery in though, and trying to start the car and you could hear the starter having a tough time. Great.For those who don't know the starter is under the inlet on these M54 engines. So while this was being done I decided to replace the CCV system with a kit from C3BMW. This was all fitted today. I also got a little dehumidifier pouch as the car steams up on the windscreen a fair bit inside.Here are some fitting photos from today, was a bit of a pain getting the inlet off, didn't really find much online for getting the inlet off from an X3 M54 but got there in the end.The sonofabeech. It was spinning freely. And original.Didn't get any photos of the new CCV kit fitted but its all fitted and the old pipes were very brittle. The car is all back together and it was a relief to hear it start up first time once all back together.It was evident that the oil leak is coming from the Vanos leak so the inlet will be coming back off very soon to have this replaced which is annoying, but not know how to do so, this will be done along with a full service of the car.The Pounds Per Mile sheet will be updated soon, I don't even want to look currently!Some nicer updates soon hopefully and do not wish this job on anyone!

I see the starter as being very unfortunate.Court_S said:Sounds like you’re getting there with the car. The starter motor looks like a pig (I think I’m going to need to do it on my other half’s 125i).I’ve spent a bloody fortune on my 130i since May last year albeit a fair bit is by choice on mods.Ha I can't wait to change some bits over to nicer bits but want to get some key bits serviced first!

GrantD5,"Been a bit quiet on here, I do have a boot full of bits to fit.I have a braided HEL Vanos hose, NGK plugs found on ebay.Millers oil, ready for an oil change from Opie Oils.Got some bits from C3BMW - Oil filter, Air filter, Panel filter 2 aux belts. Think I am going to leave the aux belts now until I do the cooling.Still have the earth straps to fix, and I also got a replacement centre heating vent to fit as the one in the car now had a Parrot kit stuck on not very well and covered in crusty glue, so will be removing the old vent and removing the parrot kit and hopefully not much damage caused to wiring when fitted.The EML keeps coming back on now but taking it to a friend to run some live data and see whats going on and hopefully find out whats going on when the plugs are changed. I am around the 1100-1200 miles driven now in ownership and I am due a drive up to Liverpool next weekend, was hoping to get the car serviced today but not looking likely now.Did give the car a clean a couple weeks ago quickly too, just a snowfoam and rinse and a 1 bucket wash at a friends unit.Car really needs some suspension work to I think the front shocks are gone.

GrantD5,"Been a while since any kind of update, the car has been working fine really apart from the misfire and the car feeling a little tired. I have done just under 3500 miles since ownership. Not needed an oil top up, have had to top up the coolant once before my trip to the liverpool region and once today while having the service. Typical BMW really.Anyway, while visiting my friend in Wirral, we took a trip to watch my local team Dagenham & Redbridge play away at Altrincham. It was not worth the 3-0 defeat but I got front row parking essentially.Couple other photos since the last update.Today see the oil & filter change, air filter, pollen filter, spark plugs and HEL vanon braided pipe. Also had the Parrot kit removed and centre vent replaced.I was told upon purchase the coilpacks had been changed recently, it appears they have replaced all 6 with Bosch units.The plugs looked a little worse for wear.Replaced with some brand new like for likes.Old oil filter out. Yuck.Pollen filter. Yuck.Air filter wasn't too dirty but it felt very stiff compared to new.Vanos pipe replaced with a HEL braided unit.Finally it was time to fix a couple bits on the interior, I removed some glue from the internal side of the windscreen from permit stickers etc. I also had the Parrot kit removed FINALLY, it had been dangling around since the early days of ownership, and I also replaced the centre vent. The new centre vent has silver tips on the vent adjusters, so I am assuming this is from a facelift, so I am going to try and get the sides to match now, definitely looks a little nicer for me anyway.There was a lot of wiring to come out!And a photo to end the day off.The car needs a massive clean especially after that Sahara sand landing here, and the engine bay can now be cleaned after it's had a service.Next up I think will be a rear parking sensor replacement as it is killing me, the beep alone when going in to reverse grinds me. Going to start buying my parts ready for coolant system replacement. Already got some prices from C3BMW but any advice please let me know. ","March 19, 2022"

I like the adaptive suspension option as it softens the ride. Mixed views on whether a tyre greater than 21” makes the ride a bit harsh as well.They come with quite a bit of options.

Standard lights are a little disappointing after being used to Xenons.However, all of the above can be remedied with a higher spec 6cyl car - just factor increased depreciation with the new X3 due later this year.A great car overall and objectively, one I'll find very hard to justify replacing.

If there's anything specific you want to know, give me a shout. The 5 series is a fantastic car but Mrs Toon prefers the SUV seating position which a lot of women seem to prefer so that may be a factor.

If you want to keep it simple then insist on a HP (regular car loan) and I’m sure they’ll still do you something as that’s got to be better than cash. Then complete paperwork, pay for deposit, take car and within 14 days exercise your right to withdraw from the agreement. That way you benefit from the best price (assuming they’ve done that in exchange for your taking out BMW finance) but you can then choose to pay as you like - cheaper loan, cash etc. You call the BMW FS and exercise your right to withdraw, then pay up using a debit card.

Added pretty much every option (apart from driver assistance packaged and tow bar). Managed to get roughly 10k off (so cost of options).

Did you managed to haggle them down at all?Hi, no further luck in Cardiff, they were simply not interested in getting the business so I held out and went to Staffordshire to pick up the car. It had more miles (17k on a 2020 plate if I recall), not sure how they managed that in a pandemic but it was a good deal as I work from home so the car pretty much remains doing the kids runabouts during the week before it get it back for the weekends. I have had it since May and it is now on 22k.All went well, it had 4 new tyres which was a pleasant surprise given they are 21” rfts, apart from getting a speeding ticket that day (zoom awareness course sorted that) and they forgot to service it which was a surprise…all sorted at my local dealer with the supplying dealer picking up the tab.It is averaging around 19-21mpg round town and will do approx 32mpg on a run which I think is pretty fair considering the performance and pops/bangs which are quite comical for a family suv and makes me smile still today. I have seen as low as 11mpg when stretching its legs though but you should not think about fuel cost with one of these.Finally the only sour point was that both my son and myself were thrown BMW motorsport coats also as part of the deal, despite many chases and promises they still didn’t show up. I have not given up though!Some gratuitous shots, seats are fantastic as (re)posted above.It is currently worth approx what I paid for it on wbac.Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 SouthSide92 said: Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49 Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 ","December 13, 2021"
