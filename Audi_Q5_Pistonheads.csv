caiss4,"I've got a Q53.0 TFSI with DSG gearbox.The car is now 10 years old with 65,000 miles and absolutely no issues with the DSG box (in fact no issue at all except for a recent corroded wire on the fan pack - famous last words )When the car was about 4 years old the Audi specialist I use did advise changing the gearbox oil and then discovered this particular one was sealed for life so it has seen no maintenance and behaves exactly as it did when new.ETA: as for use they are excellent as a slush box, if Sport mode is available then it really sharpens performance plus driving on the paddles is good too. My only complaint is it can decide to default to auto mode rather too quickly if you don't make a manual input.Edited by caiss4 on Tuesday 7th February 13:29 Edited by caiss4 on Tuesday 7th February 13:29 ","February 07, 2023"

Does anyone have any thoughts on Q5 vs Freelander 2?Done 30k+ over the last 5 years in our Auto FL2 TD4 HSE. Only faults are a couple of leccy door locks are playing up. I'd go for a later facelift one without tints if possible. I really rate them, no leaks or rust on a Land Rover ??! We tow 1500kgs easily and (when not towing) hoover up a 500 mile regular Scotland jaunt without refuelling. Cambelt service at 10yrs old and also do all the trans fluids at same time (not in LR schedule of course)Not driven a Q5 to compare though. Chrismawa said: ","February 07, 2023"

But, Haldex can throw up a trans error which is a cue to get it serviced by a specialist. On just over 90k at 12yo I had a couple of error messages (when towing in that mad 40c in the summer), but since then it got a bit of a workout in the recent snow and not a peep.As said, there's no schedule for changing trans, PTU, diff and Haldex fluids (sealed for life ) but it would pay to change these at 10 years.ETA I've not used these guys but loads of useful info here https://www.freelanderspecialist.com/Edited by richardxjr on Tuesday 7th February 15:37 trevalvole said: Scrump said: Edited by richardxjr on Tuesday 7th February 15:37 ","February 07, 2023"

He had it for 14 months and it was constantly in the garage, mostly with electrical gremlins.

TheNSA,"Hi everyone. Need some advice. I’ve always bought new or nearly new and it’s that time again to change car.My previous two cars were a Hyundai IX35 and then a Renault Kadjar. I’m a large guy and like a big car.This time round I was all set on a nearly new Hyundai Tucson or Santa Fe, however I’ve stumbled across a 3yr old top of the range, top spec Audi Q5 S Line Plus that’s in my price range. However it has 82k miles on the clock.My mate who is a car salesman (boo hiss) says that is nothing for this car.What do you think? I really need impartial advice.The car has full Audi service history. ","February 03, 2018"
Deerfoot,TheNSA said:What do you think? I really need impartial advice.How long do you intend to keep it? What's your annual mileage? TheNSA said: ,"February 03, 2018"
TheNSA,I intend to keep it 2 to 3 years. Annually mileage maybe 15k or so.Thanks. ,"February 03, 2018"
Wooda80,"Pros: Better quality ( in terms of feel ), better driving, more stylish, more prestigious car. All subjective and debateable of course.Cons: It WILL cost you more in maintenance over the next few years than a nearly new car. How much more - impossible to say but £0-2000 more would be a reasonable range.If you really fancy the Audi and you are prepared to stand the risk of additional maintenance costs then go for it. If you look at the Audi and your personal opinion is that you can't tell Stork from butter, or if you don't think it's worth the risk of additional running costs then stick with a nearly-new. ","February 03, 2018"
Deerfoot,"OK, in that case you need to work out if selling a 5/6 year old Q5 with 110/130,000 miles will be easier than shifting a Tucson etc...Personally I'd go with the nearly new (in warranty) option. ","February 03, 2018"

","February 03, 2018"
TheNSA,"Ok that kind of advice has sold me against the Q5. This is the st they don’t tell you about dealer warranties.The branch has a nice, black, mid-upper range 17 plate Tucson that will cost me less than I’m paying just now.Think i’ll put my sensible pants on and take that option.

Big GT,"The car buying public in general have an unhealthy fixation with Mileage.82K is not high mileage!! Its higher than average.You need to consider resale, it will be harder to shift the Q5 in the future due to the above.As others have said maintenance most likely will be higher as major service (belts, etc ) will need replacing soon.But if it well maintained then the Q5 will go on 2/3 times that.However you have to weight up the costs.Drive the cars, budget in the repayments / potential service costs then see what you believe is the best value for money.Personally I would a Skoda Kodiaq as the lease / Finance deals on these are very good ATM ","February 04, 2018"

We are not planning to buy new, so it will be unlikely that a local non Audi dealer would have both engines available to test drive. We will test drive before committing to a purchase, however, as you can appreciate, I want to limit contact and I don't want to waste anyone's time either.I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on what what engine suits the Q5 best?
