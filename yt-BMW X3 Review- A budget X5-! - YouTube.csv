4,"I've had my G01 LCI M40i for a little over a year now. I love it. No major complaints. The B58 is perfect for it. Handles fine. Suspension is decent, unlike the M's which are brutal. No complaints about the interior or exterior styling. I love the exterior styling. The interior is fine. My only complaint comes from the seats. My back doesn't like them. I have the heated and cooled seats. Wish the massaging seats from the M550 were offered. I got spoiled by those and I want them back. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with the vehicle. I could do without the ""mild hybrid"" 48V BS and the resulting Auto start/stop, but otherwise, all good.","

9,I've got my 30i now for 5 days and I can say I'm so happy. It's almost perfect. The build quality is light years ahead of previous f31 I have owned. That car was such a crap on the inside.

10,"Got the ix3 that looks identical and honestly love this car. It's well built, the styling is old fashioned which for me is a positive and the amount of buttons inside is a dream (I'm old fashioned like that). Like how the front looks too and it drives better then the x5 - it just handles better and more fun. My lease is up next year and I'm most likely going to keep the car forever and get something like a used 2017 x5 for my off roading needs. Ive never had the feeling that I would want to keep a car until this one so fingers crossed nothing breaks before (or after) the next year haha!","

15,"I've been driving this exact same car, same colour, same hybrid version since October 2021. So, here's my take on it. Brilliant!!! I even have the  real M-Sports seats (not these standard seats shown here), which are a delight, both optically and from a comfort aspect. The engine, in Sport Mode, with that extra battery power to boost acceleration, is really amazing. Top speed? Well, I live in Germany so am often on the Autobahn. 200kph is no problem and the car sits like it's stuck to the road. Handling is good, interior is pleasing and very functional, I agree that the front is not the most attractive car on the road. Negatives? The battery range is crap. However.... The displayed battery range depends on how you have driven the car before depleting the battery. If you were pedal to the metal all the time, the range after the next charge will be crap. If you were driving conservatively, accelerating slowly and using the cruise control, you will get a displayed range of over 40 km. What you won't ever get is the advertised 55 kms. My last car was the 2 litre X3 diesel. The car before that was the 3,5 litre 4 Series Grand Coupé. I do have some small complaints, but on the whole am very happy. Oh yeh, I test drove the Mercedes GLC 300e Plug in Hybrid. Full battery, in October, 19 degrees C ambient temperature. Range, 19 kilometers. Yes, Mercedes bullshits too!!!","

16,"I came from a 981 Cayman S that I had driven daily for 10 years to an X3 M40i. I'm so impressed with the car, it's the perfect blend of practicality, comfort, and performance when you need it. Sure it doesn't quite have the poise and fun handling of the Cayman, but it's so much easier to live with in a 1 car garage. I was worried about reviewers saying the ride was harsh, to me on terrible Scottish road surfaces it's really comfortable without being wafty, really quiet on the interior too. Love that this model has proper buttons rather than touchscreen everything. Only thing I really miss is the Burmeister Stereo from the Porsche, the Harman Kardon isn't even close to that (although that was a £3k option so can't expect it to be. I cross shopped with a Macan S / GTS, and the BMW was £20-30k cheaper with similar options, a no brainer.","

Is it that difficult, to insulate the sound in the cabine or to fit seat belt adjustments? I don't think so, because if this was the case, why don't the competitors have to deal with those problems? So sad to see that they just don't listen to their customers feedback","

Great car, does everything previous X5 40D family car did & more. Hybrid, any manufacturer/model - No-Way, modern financial rip-off. Negatives, lower seat driving position than an X5, if this is important. Strange wheel sizing especially when changing from summer to winter tyres (Had to buy 4 new tyres plus 4 new wheels at same time. No winter or all season tyres made by any Tyre manufacturer for UK market, for 21 inch BMW X3 LCI wheels - Yet available in N America). Due to date when ordered, wireless charging was deleted. No rear heated seats option when date ordered. Once car passes 3 year point from new, BMW's become expensive to maintain. Positives, drives like a sports car, not an SUV, reasonable petrol fuel economy, does everything X5 did previously. Highly recommend BMW LCI X3 M40I. NOTE: Tyre manufacturers need to keep-up with modern wheel sizing of new vehicles, so consumers can have options to drive safely on winter/summer/all season tyres in UK.","
