ducnick,"One of my neighbours has got one already.. oh no it’s a Ford kuga, but they look so similar.There is a fairly complex equation that determines how good looking a car can be. It’s based on size, height, number of doors, number of seats, luggage capacity etc. as a car becomes more practical it becomes harder to design it to look good. Let’s face it, any school kid could sketch a good looking gt car. Try sketching a good looking car that seats 5, has 4 doors, can fit in a U.K. parking space with room to open the door etc it’s hellishly complicated by the packaging requirements of transverse engine, fwd etc.When designing a gt car the designer may features from the stylistic toolbox eg flying buttresses, double bubble roof , coke bottle hips etc to create a pleasing silhouette, that doesn’t work when designing a small crossover. Packaging necessities result in them all looking basically the same. All you can do is resort to different grille, non functional vents etc to differentiate them.Edited by ducnick on Tuesday 22 March 21:08","March 22, 2022"

Recharging costs pennies by comparison, and if you have your own PV (and battery) setup at home, it can be near enough free motoring, with a ""full tank"" every single day, and no need to ever set foot in a local suburban service station ever again.I just don't see how cars this maser will survive at all, and even the thought of buying something that is likely to become an ICE orphan product, well, it just doesn't make any sense for MY use case.In saying that, for what it is, I think it's an okay product, although I'd be going for an alfa if this were my target segment.If you can afford to pay the £100,00 or so for the top model I'm not sure the cost of the fuel is that much of a bother. Not being able to drive it into a lot of the Asian cities might be more of an issue.A car for the Middle East and USA?","March 23, 2022"

I don't like this macan clone but if i was without taste or partially blind then road tax and mpg are almost inconsequential in this price bracket. I can't tell you how much a petrol Range Rover does to a 100 quid's worth of liquid gold but not much, if potential owners with money in the bank are concerned with costs they would have bought/ will buy a vehicle with those criteria in mind.In this price bracket , owners of these types of SUV who live near me couldn't care less about fuel costs as it simply frees up the roads.","March 24, 2022"

urquattroGus,"Wow, not a looker is it.One paper this would be of interest depending upon price.The Stelvio Quad is so much better looking and it seems like it might drive better too, will be interesting to see what the press say.I had 5 years in a Giulia Quad and have now unexpectedly ended up in a different sort of car, a pre facelift F pace SVR which I'm really enjoying for it's Luxury, boisterous character and practicality, good VFM too.For non daily I owned a 3200 AC and I'm wondering if I can stretch to an MC stradale at some point! Seems like the MC20 and the Granturismo have been the only good looking exciting Maserati's worthy of the badge since they discontinued the Quattroporte V.I drove a diesel Ghibli at some point, yeuch that was horrible. And look at the astronomical prices of the Trofeo Ghibli and Levante....Edited by urquattroGus on Thursday 24th March 16:19","March 24, 2022"

shih tzu faced,"Sad that Maserati have been reduced to this. I know, they have to make them to survive, SUVs are what people want etc etc. I’m not even a hater of SUVs; the Macan, Lexus UX, Alfa Tonale, Mazda CX30 all spring to mind as quite nice cars but this is a hideous, enormous mess. Looks like it weighs about 5 tonnes, and ground clearance seems laughable. Dashboard is a horrible tech fest and the seats don’t exactly look inviting either. Apart from that though, great!Gutting for me because I love a lot of the older Maseratis; Ghibli, Indy, Bora, Khamsin, Merak, 3200GT…","March 24, 2022"
