The 12:1 steering ratio compared to 13:1 to classic sports cars (Porsche, etc.) and 14.5:1 for 'normal' cars is just mind boggling.

Thanks for all the Carwow content. I know you tend to drag race top of the line cars but I was wondering whether Carwow would consider racing a Skoda Octavia VRS Diesel 4x4 with a BMW xDrive 320d. They have roughly the same specs on paper and I'd be interested to see which performed better on the runway. Also, seeing Yianni in a Skoda might be quite enjoyable.

Best wishes,

Why? In my opinion, the sitting position is worst than in a Macan and GLC, putting the Porsche in the first one (yet I didn't drive those cars). And I listened about the noises of the car and to leave every day during long time can result annoying. Equal with the exausht sistem, for a long time owner can result bundersome.
But, I have to wait until the firsts months of 22 to know wich one test and decided.
