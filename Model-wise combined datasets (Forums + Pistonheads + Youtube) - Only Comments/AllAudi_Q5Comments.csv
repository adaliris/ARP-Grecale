I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
My dealer just told me to expect 6-8 weeks for delivery via Emden after the build week.
My Q5 is scheduled for build week 12 (21st March) and the estimated delivery to the dealer is by the end of May. The dealer informed me that they have not been notified of any specification changes. The charger has been installed so all I need now is something to plug the cable in to.
It will be worth the wait
I’m build week 15 in mid April so will watch your progress with interest. 👍
I ordered mine on the 19th March and was given provisional week 16 build and estimated delivery 31st july
Fingers crossed! 🤞🏼
My Q5 was supposed to be built last week. My dealer has informed me that there is no tracking information on the manufacturing computer. She is checking with Audi sales over the next couple of days.
Hopefully it’s been built 🤞🤞I had a call today and week 16 has been confirmed !
"As a side issue, the new Q5 hybrid has 4*EV modes, EV, Hybrid, Battery Hold and Charge. The Charge option enables the engine to charge the hybrid batteries. I do not know yet how much of the engines 'resource' is used when Charge is selected."
That’s good news that your build is going ahead. What spec do you have on order?
45tsfi edition 1 comfort and sound pack 21” wheels in Daytona grey
Nice spec!
Love my edition oneSent from my iPad using Tapatalk
I hate this waiting lol I wish I was more patient 😂
It’ll be worth the wait 🤗
"My dealer told me today that its at stage 30, waiting to be transported to the ship."
Excellent news that your order is progressing! 😊
Just spoke to my dealer and my cars built waiting to get on the ship 👍👍
I've heard nothing yet! Envyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
I thought yours was waiting to get on a ship ??
"Yes, the Titanic....."
Nor have I but fingers crossed it was built last week. 🤞🏼
Audi customer services gave me the wrong information. Mine is still at level 20.
Maybe it’s something to do with it being a hybrid ?I should have my vin number tomorrow !
Maybe that's the case. I will provide you with an update as and when.With the vin you can add your new Q5 to the myAudi app.
👍👍 thanks for that
Got my email today with vin number and status saying in transit (to ship) whatever that means
Just received an email from Audi U.K. to say my Q5 has been built and has completed the final checks. Fingers crossed for a swift transit to the U.K.!😊
Mine could be on the same ship as yours. 😊
My dealer could get no sense out of Audi UK sales when they were called. They then sent an email and got some answers. My Q5 has been built but there are some parts that need to be fitted but are not in stock. I have no more details and I am not sure if this is caused because my Q5 is a 55 tfsi e Competition which has now been removed from the UK price list. No one can give an eta as to when it will ship so it is now down to waiting for the next update.
I’m in the same situation with the same car on order.
I enquired with an Audi Dealer in London today - they are estimating a 32 week wait for the Q5. Order now and it might be delivered by Santa Claus if you're lucky
"I spoke to my dealer today and my Q5 is still waiting for components. What I did find out from Audi Sales UK is that the components are coming through but not at the rate that they are needed. Also, I was told that the specification I ordered in October 2021 will be met."
"First post.Ordered a Q5 55 TFSI e in the last week of March with an estimated delivery date of October/November (the dealer added ""if you are lucky""). I don't know the build week yet but will be extremely happy with delivery before Christmas."
"I ordered the same in October 2021. At this point in time it has been built but it is waiting for a few components to be fitted. Being realistic, I believe that you will get yours before the end of this calendar year."
Good news for me mines landed in Germany not too long now 🤞
Also found out today my dealer changed my order for a previous order on exactly the same spec car that was cancelled I was wondering why it was so quick👍👍to my dealer
Nice one! 😊
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Congratulations. If only.
Anymore updates on yours bulla ??
Sadly not. Just the email on 21 April saying it had cleared the final inspection. I’m hoping it’s made it’s way onto a ship by now though. 🤞
Update on my car for those interested email yesterday saying it is in the uk this was a build 8week car ordered aug 21👍💥
Won’t be too long now then!😎Did you also get an email when your car arrived in Germany?
Watching boats lol
"No , I just got one saying it was in transit on march 30th then same again on April 23rd"
"This is my first q5 , annual mileage 10k can any body give service advise ?should it be on yearly or variable"
This must be very frustrating.
"Frustrating it is, however there is a plus side. I keep on asking my dealer to include extra items FOC and they always say yes. Next time I will ask if they can include a new RS6 FOC."
I got an email from Audi uk saying my cars on a boat to the uk not too long now 🤞🤞
"Excellent, the difficult bit has been done so hopefully the rest is plain sailing. BTW what configuration have you gone for? I am no further forward but I wait with baited breath."
I’ve gone for an edition 1 comfort and sound 45tfsi in Daytona grey with 21” wheels
"Very nice, especially the colour. Maybe mine is taking longer because its a hybrid."
That’s all I can think it is hopefully yours won’t be too much longer 🤞🤞🤞
This morning apparently the system is showing my Q5 as “In Transit to Ship” in Mexico despite having received the completed final inspection email 4 weeks ago. 🙄
Blimey once it’s in the uk it goes quick I can pick mine up next Wednesday 😃😃
Picking mine up Friday👍💥
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
👍👍👍
"Hi Sim, bet you get little or no sleep before the end of the week."
"Must agree it’s been a huge wait , don’t think there is a review anywhere that I haven’t read, hope it’s worth it"
I have had all flavours of Audi's since 1983. Every car was worth it.
Hope all you guys picking up and waiting the arrival of their Q5’s enjoy the ownership. Have been fortunate to own several over the years and enjoyed everyone one of them. They have all been brilliant.
"Very much enjoying my SQ5 after a 9 month wait.Just been away to the coast and averaged an indicated 42 mpg on the way down and 42.8 mpg on the way back (approx 120 miles each way of motorway, dual carriage way and mostly A roads and not particularly economy focused).Car is very relaxing to drive and road and wind noise are well suppressed, but plenty of go when given the beans."
Ordered a Q5 Competition 55 on the 1st of November 2021 in Daytona grey thinking that 6 months would be plenty of time as my lease on current Audi was ending in May 2022. Was recently given a 41 build week from my dealer and will be lucky to get the car this year.
I have just received an update on my Q5 55 tfsi Competition ordered October 2021. It is still in Mexico waiting for some components. No idea when it will be shipped.
"After chasing the dealer again I was told yesterday it was at port of exit, released. I am assuming this is Emden, not Mexico and therefore at status 38. Progress but current car is due a service in 30 days so race against time to avoid unnecessary costs. For info I ordered mine in August."
Thank you gw82 for the update. What flavour Q5 did you order? My understanding is that the car is shipped from Sao Paolo to Emden then on another ship to Teesside then Sheerness. My dealer tells me that from status 38 to handover is between 3 and 4 weeks. BTW due to my Q5 delays my dealer has offered to pay half the service cost.
"I’ve got a 55 tfsi e competition (is that the same as yours). The last time I ordered an Audi (non Q5) it went from Emden to Sheerness directly. Not sure if that’s changed.They’ve given me a great price for my current car and I’m trying to get them to get rid of the £1k deposit too. I can get a good price for a service as my brother used to work there and knows the manager well. Even so I’d like to avoid it!Good luck with yours, it’s frustrating. The only thing not driving me mad is that I love my current car and will miss it when it’s gone."
"Snap. My Q3 went from Emden to Teesside as it is built in Gyor, Hungary. The Q5 is only built in Mexico. Audi consolidates all UK shipments in Emden. I was also given a good part exchange for my Q3 as my dealer tells me that demand exceeds supply for second hand Audi's. Seemingly new ones are difficult to get hold of.My Q3 is fantastic but I wanted something a bit bigger and hybrid. That left me with the Q5 and the Q3 hybrid is not quattro.The dealer should pay for the whole service as it has to be done before it is put on the forecourt."
"I’ve got the S4 Avant which is actually more practical than the Q5 but I didn’t want the new version which is diesel. We have three kids so the Q7 was an option but a bit slow, bit more expensive and too big for the narrow residential streets where we live. I did briefly look at the RSQ3 but think it would have just been too small."
Just had a call from my dealer my car landed this morning 😃😃 I pick it up on Friday 👍👍
Nice! Which uk port did it come in to?
Please send me a photo. I have waited so long that I have forgotten what a Q5 looks like.
Not meaning to be negative but on the Q3 forum some new cars have been delivered with depopulated options. I suggest that you contact your dealer to make sure that the car you ordered is identical to the car that they have received.
"Picked mine up on Friday , lt came with two keys which I wasn’t expecting, also has the proper armrest,"
"The only thing missing from my SQ5 was wireless charger, other than that all standard equipment present, including matrix headlights which I think have been deleted from high end Q3's."
Sheerness
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
I will post a photo up 👍👍
I’ve been monitoring boats into Sheerness but didn’t see one that arrived today or yesterday. I must have missed it but I hope mine was on it!
How many keys did you get out of interest?
Two.
For those awaiting cars at sheerness the Danube Highway is due in tomorrow. Appears to be late as hasn’t left yet but I’ll keep tracking it.
So that's what a Q5 looks like! Looks fantastic and very nice colour. I want one!
😂😂 yours will get there just keep getting as many freebies from them as you can !
Cracking car Workshy!!!
I like the wheels. From memory I didn’t have a choice of wheels on the 55 Competition.
Danube Highway is on the way to Sheerness. Due in 10.30 tonight.
VAG also use Port of Tyne for the North and Scotland.
"Tyneside for the North of England/Scotland, Sheerness for the South. Everything is consolidated in Emden so the ship has all flavours of Audi's and other German manufacturers vehicles."
I think Grimsby too for for Midlands.
"Finally an update email from Audi 5 weeks from build completion!“Just to let you know, your new Q5 is carefully wrapped up, safe and sound on board our ship to the UK. We'll let you know when it has arrived.”This is the first “in transit” email I’ve received - not sure if they mean it’s on a boat from Mexico or Emden."
That will mean from Emden to UK so hopefully not long now.
Thanks for that! 😊
Which port is nearest the dealer?
Port of Tyne for Scotland. City of Rotterdam arrived yesterday from Emden so if the emails are arriving late (as they do in my experience) that’s a possibility. 🤞
Yes that’s probably the one it was on.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
"Meanwhile in Sheerness the Danube Highway has unloaded and another ship, the Parana is due in from Emden this evening."
Same email I got and two days after got one saying it had landed in uk and it was delivered to my dealer 7 days after 👍👍
That’s excellent. Enjoy your new Q5 tomorrow!
Thanks bulla I can’t wait !My daughter took delivery of her a3 saloon on Tuesday so we are a happy household !
Just had my first unprompted update from the dealer since I ordered in August. Car is at Sheerness and should be at the dealer in about a week.
The long wait is almost over!👍
Very nice car Workshy! Love the wheels and the colour😎
Looks seriously good. I considered that colour but she who must be obeyed wanted Navarra Blue.
Absolutely loving this car !!!!!
I’m not surprised! 😄What would you say are the features that most stand out to you?
Just love the seats so comfy the b and o sound system is amazing and it’s a dream to driveYour going to love yours 👍👍
Just off the phone with the dealer. My Q5 will be ready to collectearly next week!! 🍾🥂
Nice one need to see some pics when you get it 👍👍👍
You lot are making me feel like Billy no mates. No movement yet on my Q5 hybrid.
"I also ordered a Q55 TFSie (Nov 2021), dealer has given me a week 41 build.Do Audi build the car specs in batches?Also has anyone been given a loan car when waiting for delivery?"
Hey guys - so we went to order a Q5 today earlier than we would to be fair due to lead times. They were quoting between Oct-Dec for factory order. Amazing how much is unavailable due to chip shortages etc however probably going to snap up an Edition 1 Sportback they’ve got.It’s also amazing how much more expensive these cars have gotSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Hi Nemo, as a matter of interest what new configuration were you considering and was it petrol, diesel or hybrid?"
"Hey mwcltd, it was and is the 45 TFSI petrol. Reading back on this is yours the hybrid that’s stuck?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
"Yes, it is. The model I ordered was the Q5 55 tfsi e Competition."
What does the Competition designation consist of?
From the current Audi Q5 configurator it is the same as the Edition 1 but it is only used for hybrid variants.
Tell you what’s annoying me now - all this talk of tax/VAT cuts. Should’ve gone for a factory build and just waited and waited.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Looks seriously good. Mine will be that colour when it eventually arrives after a wait of 8 months.
Nice
Very nice 👍👍👍
How long have you all been waiting for a factory build?I am currently at 8 months with no sign of delivery for a Q5 Competition 55 TFSie.
"Hi K76, I am in the same boat as you. I ordered the same car 20th October 2021. About 2 weeks ago my dealer contacted Audi Customer Support and found out that it had been built less a few components. Currently Audi estimates that it will be shipped from Mexico sometime in August this year."
Picked the car up today - tried to post a pic in new thread but not letting me for some reason.The MMI bits have changed a fair bit from the previous Audi but have to say behind the BMW iDrive (on first impressions…that could obviously change)Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Don't hold your breath but I have received an email today to state that my Q5 is being shipped. With all the waiting Audi has made a happy man very old.
At last some good news!Hopefully won't be too long now.I'm loving Navarra Blue. Such a deep colour and looks tremendous when the sun hits it.
I received the “Our work here is done” email on 21 April and picked my Q5 up last week - so 7 weeks after the build was completed.
"Serious question, how do you guys get those updates via email? Getting info from my dealer is like squeezing water from a stone."
"In the U.K., Audi U.K. send a few standard (automated?) emails at key points in the order process. For example, build complete, in transit and arrived in the U.K. They don’t come from the local dealer."
Other than the colour how are you liking the car ??
"Bulla said:It’s outstanding! A real step up from the VW Tiguan in refinement. Much quieter and smoother and a real quality feel all round. It’s such a pleasure to drive. With getting on for twice the horsepower, it feels much quicker off the mark already which will improve once properly run in.Only been for short drives so far but it feels very comfortable and will be well suited to longer trips, particularly with the adaptive cruise control.The MMI and virtual cockpit are a great size and high definition with good customisation options. The higher location of the MMI makes such an improvement to the screens usability.Very pleased with the Q5 and looking forward to going on some longer trips! 😁Click to expand...We took a trip to Cornwall from London at the weekend and had no aches when we got there and used less than half a tank each way 👍👍"
"""Flexible"" was much cheaper for me - I do about £8K per year."
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Welcome to our forum
Welcome to the forum. I ordered my 55 tfsi e Competition on the 20th October 2021. I heard nothing for about 6 months then it was stuck at stage 20. About 10 days ago I received an email from Audi UK to say that the car was fully built and tested and being put on a ship to Emden then on to another ship to the UK. From leaving the Sao Paolo factory it can take up to 8 weeks for the car to be handed over to the owner. At this point in time I should get the Q5 at the beginning of August.
"Thanks, that’s really helpful. I have heard nothing for about 7 months now (ordered in November 2021).I’ll give the dealer a call to request the order number and ask Audi UK for a more detailed progress update.If I managed to get the car a month or so after you, I’d be very happy but not sure if that’ll be the case!"
"Your dealer is only given basic tools to find the cars status. I ended up getting my order number, emailing Audi UK customer support then a day later I got a far more detailed status."
"Similar here, ordered a Vorsprung Competition last Nov - so far zero progressGood to see some hybrids are coming through; I suspect Vorsprung spec = more susceptible to chip related delays."
"Nujjy said:Hi all,I’m new to this forum and can’t tell you how much I’ve been looking for fellow Q5 orderers in the UK.I ordered a Competition 55 TFSIe in Nov 2021 and had started to think that the order was never going to arrive, given that they’ve discontinued that model now.MWCltd - has your car arrived now?

Asked for update from the dealership this week and was told the car did not have a confirmed build week. Following this I emailed Audi and was told that the car has an unconfirmed week 37 build and they will be able to update in a couple of weeks."
"Thanks K76, that's interesting (and promising!).Out of interest, did you email the standard email Audi UK address (customer.services@audi.co.uk)?I tried calling them today and they were incredibly unhelpful so hopefully I'll get a better response via email."
I emailed them a couple of months ago when my car was on order and they just told me to speak to my dealer. 🙄
"Me too, they are useless. I suspect mwcltd's +ve response was because the car was already well into the build phase."
"I don't know what factors enabled me to get a good result. I got my dealer involved and they helped. I have had Audi's for 39 years. Yes, the Q5 was built but waiting for a few components. Audi UK customer support are worse than useless. as they tow the party line and are totally incapable of thinking for themselves or establishing a relationship with the customer."
I emailed the customer service email address. Told them I didn’t want passed back to the dealer. They have told me to get back in touch in a couple of weeks which is positive and is more than I have been getting from my dealership.
"Well, as expected, I got an utterly useless reply from Audi UK, asking me to speak to my dealer for any updates on my car.I then asked if they had an idea of a typical lead time for a Q5/Q5 TFSIe and whether 12 months from my order date was still realistic but yet again got the same response about speaking to the dealer!"

Welcome to group therapy
Its on a ship to Emden. Current estimate for handover is mid August. The gestation period for my Q5 will be 10 months. I have almost forgotten what colour I ordered.
"Will you try and wait to Sept 1st for 72 plate or have you a private plate to put on it?Also, if you're taking out a PCP deal (and not paying it straight off) what has dealer said about the finance rate?"
I have had a private plate for 38 years so I am not concerned when it is registered.I have always used PCP and traded in my existing Audi. The dealer has agreed in writing that the equity on my current Q3 will not reduce from the valuation in October 2021 but I have yet to negotiate the finance rate on the Q5.
It’s good to hear things are finally happening for you 👍👍
Wakefield Audi have been very good. I was concerned that in manufacturing they might have reduced some functionality due to component shortage. They have checked with production and I am getting a full fat version. To double check before registration we are going to audit the Q5 before it is registered to me and taxed in my name.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
The only feature mine missed out on was wireless charging in the centre console. A slight annoyance but not a deal breaker.
You can retrofit that. Cheaper and IMHO better than Audi OEM. Easiest DIY upgrade I have ever done
I won't have long to wait before I find out if anything is missing.
I have received an email from Audi to say that my Q5 is wrapped up and on a ship to the UK. If I get it next month it will be 10 months from order placement at Wakefield Audi.
"This is great news! I’m sure the 10-month wait will be worth it.Still getting 00 build status on my Nov 2021 order. Looks like a 10-month wait is out of the question for me. If I even get the car this year, I’ll be surprised!"
Great news! I picked my Q5 up 14 days after receiving that email 😊
"Ordered my Q5 (My first!) on 11th April 22. Initial expected delivery date on the order form is 30 September..... I've read elsewhere that I can check the status of my order online, but can't seem to find out where - can anyone help?"
Unfortunately the online updates of orders no longer exist. All you will get are a couple of emails at key stages from Audi U.K. For example build complete or on a ship to the U.K. Your dealer can give you a status from the system but it’s a pretty broad brush answer. Mine took 18 weeks from February to June this year but added options or specification can vary the lead time.
"Thanks - I feared that was likely the case, but thanks for clearing it up. I've had nothing from the dealer yet, so I'll have to sit tight"
What spec have you ordered?
"40 TDi S Line in District Green. Standard spec apart from 20"" wheels, not the 19""s"
Very nice. They’re great cars.
"For those of you that are shortly to receive your cars, if you are taking out a PCP deal, what interest are you being charged?I ordered when the rate was 2.9% (July 2021), but when it arrived they wanted to charge me the 6.3% current at the time (April this year).After a bit of a standoff I actually signed up to 6.3% but the dealer reduced the price of the car so that my monthly payments and final price were the same as on 2.9%.Worth having a 'frank' discussion with your dealer if you are likely to be in a similar position."
What a coincidence. I am about to receive my Q5 55 tfsi e in about 2 weeks. I am purchasing on PCP and I ordered the car in October 2021. My dealer has already offered further discount to make the monthly payments identical. I don't know if it helped but I have purchased Audi's from this dealer for the last 22 years.
"@mwcltd- what was the lead time between build date and delivery date?For the first time in 8 months, the status of my order has changed to an ‘estimated’ build date in mid-October.My dealer expects it to take around 4 months before it’ll then be delivered in the UK.I’m definitely glad to see the status updated but it implies a big difference in delivery timelines, considering I only ordered a month afterwards."
The lead time between the actual build date and sailing from Mexico was 6 weeks. The main reason for this was component shortages. My estimated build date was initially week 4 2022. This was then confirmed to week 22 2022. The time taken from Mexico to Germany was just under 4 weeks. I should get the Q5 in under 2 weeks.
"Thanks, that’s really helpful. Hopefully I’ll get my Q5 before the year is out.Also 2 weeks is really soon, you must be excited!It’s been a long wait but it’ll be worth it."
Did you order a special configuration or one with a sunroof?
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
It's indeed the platinum package with a sunroof and the adaptive cruise etc. However back in September (after first delay) those options were not listed as restrictive options (only the trailer hitch which I removed from the configuration to be replaced by a aftermarket one).
"In the UK over the last 2 years the sunroof has been a stop/start option. One of the reasons that the Vorsprung model was removed from the UK price list was the sunroof. Adaptive cruise was never a showstopper but it did delay certain Q5's. In the UK there isn't now a user Audi car tracker. However, your dealer or the local Audi sales office have access to the Audi sales computer where, given your Audi order number, the status can be obtained for your car. Over the last 2 years configuring an Audi has been like playing whack-a-mole."

"Hello,I have also ordered an Audi Q5 TFSIe in Belgium Sep. 2021 with estimated time of delivery end of November 2022.At this very moment my dealer told me he could not see a production date in the system as they are about to schedule production to model year 2023.Main reason of the long lead time should be the Panoramic Roof.Who knows by the end of this year or start of 2023.... hopefully it's worth the long waiting timeGrtz"
Wakefield Audi have just informed me that the Q5 is on a car transporter to the dealer. The 10 month wait is almost over.
You deserve a medal for patience! Enjoy the collection experience and getting hands on with your new Q5! 😎
That's great news!!! Great patience - can't wait to see some pics
"Excellent, looking forward to your initial impressions as, if I remember correctly, you are coming also from a Q3 like myself. Mine is the lower powered 50 tfsie but still well pleased with it 😀."
"This is great news, mwcltd!Do you know if the spec of the car matches exactly to what you’ve ordered?I’ve been reading that the wireless charger may be back, even though it wasn’t available at the time of order."
Thank you all for your support. I am going to Wakefield Audi on Monday to confirm the specification and have the Snooper cable remove from the Q3. If all is okay then I collect the Q5 on Thursday afternoon. Once I have checked on the supplied specification then I will report back.
"Midomylo said:Hello,I have also ordered an Audi Q5 TFSIe in Belgium Sep. 2021 with estimated time of delivery end of November 2022.At this very moment my dealer told me he could not see a production date in the system as they are about to schedule production to model year 2023.Main reason of the long lead time should be the Panoramic Roof.Who knows by the end of this year or start of 2023.... hopefully it's worth the long waiting timeGrtzClick to expand...Hi,I spoke to my dealer this weekend and there is no issue with the panoramic roof as they double checked this matter. The main issue is the hybrid system (and more specifically shortage on the battery supply). The current expected building week for the car is January-23 but still not confirmed.BestNils"
I went to inspect my new Q5 hybrid yesterday and the only item missing was the wireless charging mat which I can't use and don't care about. My sales person told me that on Q5's there were problems a year ago but these have gone with deliveries in the last 6 months. What she did say was that the big problems are with the Q3 with all sorts of functionality being removed or replaced. After checking there are no Q5 hybrid battery supply problems but there are with pure EV's. Don't be put off by the estimated build week. As it gets closer they will allocate an allocated build week which could be earlier.
Great news and glad the spec matches what you ordered!
"nilsmi said:Hi Bart, indeed landing is estimated at c. 6-8weeks after building week so if they would organize delivery based on order date this could mean indeed July 23 for your order. Hopefully, they will be able to accelerate production in the meantime. I agree the delivery/waiting time on the car is unbelievable. Please note car dealer also didn't want to commit to the Jan-23 building week (which has been in my case postponed 4x times so far (from Mar22 we are now at Mar23)) so I'm not putting much confidence in the Jan-23 explanation.Regarding the options, I went for the platinum package and additional options on driver assistance apart from exterior/interior design options/packages. The option shouldn't be blocking and/or delaying the delivery time based on the details in the system.Unfortunately, due to the exceptional long waiting time, I'm currently looking at alternative options (such as stock cars) but probably will not be a Q5 (or even maybe not an Audi :-( ) as audi BE import does not give or provide any temporary solution/compensation for the increasing delivery time. I'm currently on a short-term rental and it's getting quite expensive....Click to expand...Hi Nils,Seems your configuration matches more or less mine.Do you know as from when you can cancel your order (meaning after how many time, when the delay goes overdue, from the ETA mentioned by order) is that 3 or 6 months or...?Have a similar situation, my current lease ends November this year, this would mean that I have to find an intermediate solution for 8 months, do not know if I am willing to wait that long.BR/Bart"
"Pleased to see some UK guys are getting their hybrids soon. Those EU deliveries are outrageously delayed, no way I could wait that long.Personally, I have given up after 8 months and still no estimated build week - order cancelled.I have now ordered a Mazda CX60 so will save a chunk of £££ vs the 55 Vorsprung too. Maybe back to Audi when I go full BEV, we'll see."
"Everyone has had issues with Q5's delivered from the production line. The dealer can only tell you what Audi tell them. When you ordered your Q5 did your dealer give you a tentative manufacturing date? Audi know from experience that from the factory to the dealer takes between 6 and 8 weeks. There is no point in wasting energy as regards the Q5. Nothing you say or do will accelerate the process. The Audi dealers can sell every new car they can get hold of so this is not leverage. So, you either wait, find a Q5 in stock or go to another manufacturer who will have exactly the same problems as Audi. The dealer will not care if they have to give a small amount of compensation due to late delivery or cancellation as they will make this back on the next purchaser of your Q5."
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Did you collect your car this week? How is it and has it been worth the wait?
"I collected the car late yesterday and its magic. The handover by Wakefield Audi was perfect, everything I asked for was fitted. I drove back to North Leeds as an EV and it was weird with no engine noise. At least I had the superb instrumentation to tell me everything. When I got back I had 1 mile of battery left. I charged until full and it took 2hrs 28mins. The car is so quiet and smooth helped by the 45 profile tyres as I had 40's on the Q3. I am still in learning mode but I am almost there. Was it worth the wait? Definitely, it is not a bigger Q3 as it is not as sporty and dynamic but it is significantly smoother and quieter with considerably more room."
Congratulations! Enjoy your new Q5 - they are quite different to the Q3. 😃
Update from the Audi Factory today - the lovely automated one they send out. My Q5 was booked in at time of order (April 2022) for build week 33 (which is next week). Got an email today to say it is now being built - almost a week earlier than expected. So that's got to be promising news!!
"That’s good news, contradicts the email I got from my dealer today. Was told that the factory is closed for 4 weeks."
Oh dear - that doesn’t sound good. I’m assuming that all the Q5’s are made in the same Mexican factory…. Have you had one from AudiUk rather than the dealer giving you any update?
I believe they are all made in the same factory. Update was from the dealer which allegedly came from Audi UK. This was after I complained to Audi at the lack of info from my dealer.The dealer also told me that there is an issue with the supply of the Qfsie 55 Competition model which ordered.I have started looking for alternatives as not convinced I will ever take delivery of the car.
"All Q5's are built in Sao Paolo, Mexico. The factory has not shut down. There was an issue with Audi Mexico owing money. This is now being sorted by having a meeting with local government officials. I got my new 55 tfsi e a couple of weeks ago. The only item missing was the wireless charging pad which I don't need or care about as there is a USB-C next to where the pad should go. From 2 weeks of ownership I can tell you that you will regret looking elsewhere."
Don't give up hopejustyet!I ordered a Q5 TFSIe Competition in November 2021 and have finally been given an 'estimated' build week.It's not a confirmed build week but it's the first change in status I've seen in 8 months so it seems like there is some progress.Hang in there... your car may not be far behind!

It got moved from Week 40 to Week 44 and back to Week 40 again.I won’t get too excited just yet but hopefully I’ll get that confirmed build week soon!
"Thanks, good to know, hopefully I will get delivery this year.Auto Trader is showing some good discounts on stock cars (apart from hybrids), recession starting to kickin?"
Maybe I am missing something. My Q5 55 tfsi e took 10 months from order placement. I wanted the car and was not willing to accept second best. There are a few new Q5's available in the UK from organisations who have forward ordered. The Q5 production is working as flat out as they can bearing in mind component shortages attributed to Covid-19. If you are thinking about cancelling then you are not committed to the brand or the product. All you will do is to jump from the frying pan in to the fire as every car manufacturer has the same problems to a greater or lesser extent.
"If or when I get my Q5 55 TFSie it will be my 4th Audi in a row, been very happy with all of my Audi’s so far thats why I ordered my 4th.My issue is with the BS I am getting from my dealer (factory shut down for 4 weeks, which is a total lie)and the lack of support from Audi UK.Have serious doubts that Audi will honour my order."
"I have had 15 Audi's since 1981 of all flavours. Audi will honour your order but to reassure yourself you need the Audi order number from your dealer then contact Audi CS and get them to give you the actual information not the normal response of Covid-19 and semiconductor shortages. Remember, Audi CS have been told to tow the party line which for the majority of customers is good enough."
"I sincerely hope you're using a broker, or getting an amazing deal from your dealer which is at least a few £K less than the RRP.I've saved about £20K on my last 3 x Q5's in total."
I do have an order number so that is reassuring. Audi CS recently confirmed that the factory has been closed for 4 weeks.It should reopen on Monday the 22nd of August.Hopefully if will get a confirmed build date soon.
"Well, good news today - I don't think that the Q5 factory can have been closed as was mentioned above, my build week was last week, and sure enough - just had an automated email from Audi telling me that it's finished, checked, wrapped up and leaving the factory. So looking elsewhere on here, it looks like about 6 to 8 weeks to get to me, is that right? (If so, that's bang on track for what they told me when I ordered at the start of April)"
"Good news that your build is complete! Yes, 6-8 weeks is about right from completion of build to arrival at dealer. Mexico to U.K. via Emden in Germany. Vehicles wait at each stage until the ship or car transporter is full so it can vary."
Did you get any update? Mine was ordered in January 2022 and had a September build date but that’s gone now. Hoping for an update soon.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Welcome to the forum. 😊. What spec have you ordered?
Thanks for the welcome 😊 I have the 55 TFSI e Quattro Competition S Tronic (C+S). Really looking forward to it arriving.
Got mine about 1 month ago. Its superb but I am still learning about it.
Are you happy with the colour choice? I have the same.
I have had Audi's for 40 years and this is the first time I have had Navarra Blue. The very deep colour really suits the Q5 and makes it stand out in the crowd. The best decision my wife has ever made.
"I took delivery of a Navarra blue Q5 recently after a run of silver cars. It’s a really great colour, not too dark and has real depth to the finish. When the sun catches it the colour brightens and shows off the metallic flake. 👍"
"Still don’t have a confirmed build date, beginning to accept that I won’t get the car this year."
Don't assume anything with Audi. By the end of this month they could be building the car and you will receive it by the end of November. I've had 40 years of Audi and with a new car all you can do is wait.
"I know things can change, fortunately I have an Audi TTS that I love and still look forward to driving every day but it’s time for a change after 4+ years."
You might have provided this information elsewhere but when did you order your Q5 and what configuration did you order?
"Hi,Mine was ordered now 1 year ago (September 2021), called my dealer yesterday, still no confirmed production date.Audi is not communicating anything here in Belgium, very frustrating....."
What Q5 configuration did you order?
"The Q5 I have ordered is S line 50 TFSIe, with Business pack, pano roof and some other options...."
"Ordered confirmed by the dealer on the 1st of November 2021, model is Q5 TFSIe Competition in Daytona grey with the comfort pre-conditioning."
"My Q5 TFSIe still has an estimated build week of 4 weeks’ time.I’m hoping that it doesn’t change now that it’s so close.@K75 - given your order date is similar to mine, I wouldn’t be surprised if your car also gets built around the same time."
Hi K76Exactly same as my spec!.Ordered last November and currently in transit from Grimsby to Peterborough Audi. Collecting on Tuesday (hopefully!).
Nice! I hope it is all good for you. When did you get a build date?
"I got told in April that the car had gone into manufacture, then an email in early July to say it was built but awaiting semi-conductors, then end 22nd July to say it was heading to the boat from Mexico.Got stuck in Germany awaiting more chip-sets, then arrived in Grimsby last week."
At the moment it seems like the Q5 lead time from customer order to customer receipt is about 10 to 11 months.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
I have had an update from my lease company and it doesn’t seem to add up! I ordered in Jan 2022 but it was on a shorter delivery time as they had stock on order. I have been given a new build date of June 2023 🥲🥲🥲I have asked for confirmation of the order number and date and I have been given a date of 28/10/21 and Audi (SLI) order number….very strange! Hopefully I am not waiting another year. Anyone experience similar?
The chronology just doesn't add up. You ordered the Q5 in January 2022. Bearing in mind various owners experience and mine you should be getting it about November 2022. If you know the dealer the lease company is using then I would contact the dealer with the Audi order number and get them to email to you a screen shot of the status.
Will do that 👍👍
If it helps...I ordered mine November 22 and due to be built the last week in October (week 43) at the moment!
"Thanks, what spec is yours?"
How are finding yours now that you've had it a few weeks - everything as you hoped it would be?
I have had estimated build dates previously and now I don’t have one.
"Hi mattbrx, I have just come back after using the Q5 in anger on a UK motoring holiday. Everything is great and exceeds my expectations apart from the lack of the 'side assist' safety option which is not included as standard or as an option. My base configuration was a Q5 55 tfsi e with the addition of available option packs."
"5 weeks tomorrow since the email from the Factory telling me its on its way - nothing further heard yet - fingers crossed I'll be hearing from Emden in the next few days, then it should only be about 2 more weeks before it arrives to my dealer I think...."
Typically from Sao Paulo factory to you is between 6 and 8 weeks providing the status at the factory was 38.
I got confirmed that build week would be week 43 and arriving in Belgium by 19-Dec. So indeed it should take like 6 to 8 weeks to arrive at your dealer.
"Hi Nils,Great News for you! Finally.If I am correct, you have ordered May 2021? What was you first delivery date?Mine was ordered September 2021, still no confirmation....Grtz/Bart"
I've finally got the 'In Build' email from Audi.I may actually get my Q5 before the end of this year!
"Just had an email from Audi UK, my Q5 is on the ship from Emden to the UK.... spoke with the dealer and have booked in 15th October as my collection date!!!! Fingers crossed"
"Assuming that it arrives OK and all goes well, it will be 7 weeks and 1 day from the time I got an email from Audi in Mexico saying it was preparing to leave the factory, to being sat on my driveway at home"
"Estimated date for delivery at the time of order back at the beginning of April 2022, was end of September to mid October. I don't think they're too far off with that"
Great news! How many weeks from the In Build email to collection date?
"Sounds like the delivery of factory ordered Q5’s is moving, ordered my Q5 55 on the 1st of November 2021 but still no confirmation of a build week and now not expecting delivery this year to the UK."
"Bart,Ordered in May-21. But the sequence of orderdate is not how the deliveries/builds are performed right now (so you can't conclude it will take +3months in your case). I had an initial delivery date Dec-21. I suggest to contact your dealer as they always have an estimated build week (and follow-up on a two weekly basis)."
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Apologies for such delay. It’s a s line 50 tfsi
HiWhat spec is yours? Mines the same week build I believe
"50tfsie sline fully equipped with driving assist, pano roof, etc."
Yes mines s line but no options. Still waiting to hear if build week is confirmed yet. Have you had confirmation?
"Mine is still looking good for Saturday, got the papers through to sign yesterday and have my number-plate assigned. So that all sounds good. Can't wait til Saturday now - at least I've got a 9am collection time so I won't have to wait too long"
Good luck on Saturday. Have fun.
My Q5 has now been built and I've received the 'Final Checks complete' email. Hoping that means it's not too long before it gets to Germany and then the UK.
Anyone waiting for delivery of a Q5 50 TFSi e or Q5 55 TFSi e?i would be good to know how long you have been waiting. I am just about to hit 12 months and am still without a confirmed build week for a Q5 55TFSi e.
I have a Q5 55 tfsi e. From ordering at the UK Audi dealer to me collecting the car from the dealer took just over 10 months. The build status defines where the build process is. This can be obtained by your dealer as they have access to the Audi manufacturing site.
I ordered Jan 2022 with Nationwode Vehicle Contracts and have a build date of June 2023!
"Hi K76,I have an Q5 50 TFSi e ordered in September 2021, delivery was foreseen for November 2022 and is now preliminary (no guarantee) rescheduled towards February 2023.Grtz/Bart"
Forgot to mention mine is a 55 TFSIe
"I ordered mine 20th October 2021 and got it 4th August 2022. Count yourself lucky as Q3's are not just late on delivery but have some fairly fundamental bits missing. All my Q5 had missing was the phone charging mat which is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard. All I can say is now I have got mine, it was well worth waiting for."
"You have been lucky or had a good dealer and agree that should be well worth waiting for but at the moment myself and others this car (Q55 Competition) is an non existent car in the UK, Audi need to come clean and confirm that they will supply. I have my doubts.They can’t make the war in the Eastern Europe as an excuse for a car built in Mexico."
Looks great! Enjoy!
"That's a great colour. Are there any bits missing? I don't have the phone charging mat. Now the manual, good bedtime reading."
I have had an update to say it will be moving into status twenty in the next couple of weeks and should be built month end. I have been advised its 12 weeks from this point and they are expecting to have the car at the dealership in January. I really hope this is worst case
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Shame about the rattle but they are great cars! Mine still makes me smile every time I drive it! I never use Apple Carplay but find the Audi satnav pretty good with the Google Maps overlay. Have you tried the different drive select settings as they seem to make a difference to the feel of the steering?
"I only really use the Apple Carplay for Spotify really, I'll have a fiddleI've stiffened up the steering a little in the Individual settings. it has stiffened a bit, but doesn't make a difference to the slight oversteer. Just something to get used toAwaiting a callback from the service team to book in for the loose thing.."
When the status is 38 it means that your Q5 is on the dock ready to be shipped. From then it is 6 to 8 weeks until you collect it.
"Audi are taking it back for a couple of days next week to have a look at the screw thing. They fear it won't be a while you wait, so they've sorted me a courtesy car for 3 days. Fingers crossed it's an easy fix - but I think they'll have to take the seat out to get to whatever it is. Still - 10 days with the car now, and still loving it. Had a couple of decent runs out in it as well as pottering round town, one of those was a 65 mile round trip to Brighton in that horrendous wind and rain the other night - the car purred along beautifully, sure footed and felt planted on the road. Got about 41mpg out of it too which I thought was OK. About 6 miles of local roads, 5 miles of country lanes, and the rest (54 miles-ish) was fairly decent A roads."
Still waiting to hear if mine is getting built this week. It's week build 43 and still unconfirmed!
"Bet you your Q5 is in for less than a day. It is a solid fault and to take the seat out/in takes less than half an hour. You won't get real mpg figures until its logically run in, usually about 10k miles.,"
"Order placed last week for a 40TDi Edition 1, just waiting on an idea of current delivery expectations from the dealer. Whatever it is I’m sure the wait will feel twice as long as it actually is"
Still no update on my Q5. It was due to be built this week 43 but dealer has confirmed no change no sign of it being built. Has anyone else had this issue where the week hasn’t changed but still not been built?
"RickyB said:Catching up with all the comments I think I was lucky, like mwcltd.Ordered 55 TFSIe November 2021, took delivery 13th September, but this was only 2 weeks after the date I originally asked for when I placed the order.Have now done over 5,000 miles and love it. Just the wireless charging mat missing, which I did use all the time on my previus diesel Q5, but have already got used to plugging in the phone charger everytime I jump in. USB-C socket under the armrest.The dealers, Vindis Peterborough Audi, told me Audi have stopped the 55 model and only supplying the 50 due to the micro chip shortage.I wonder if that explains the much longer delays?Click to expand...You can purchase an after market charging mat. Mine works really well"
It is currently at PDI at UK port last 4 days ago for my Q5 40 TDI.Any recent timeline for delivery to dealer please?
Good news! I have now had it confirmed that my card has been built and has a chasis number - status 30.I have been told they are built in Mexico however the screenshot states the location is Emden which is Germany.How many weeks have people waited? I have been advised it's 12 weeks normally.Thanks

It’s about 2 weeks to the dealer from Emden.
Thanks mate. Hopefully quicker than 12 weeks then.Is that recently?
Mine was delivered in June but this seems to be what people here are experiencing in the last couple of months. It can vary a bit depending on the shipping and transporter availability. It will be worth the wait!😊
My wife took a call from the dealer today - they anticipate the car will be available for us late Feb/early Mar.
That really is quick.
Good choice of trim chosen you won’t be disappointed . Unfortunately there is a lot of negativity about diesels but it suites the Q5 perfectly.
"yes, it is quicker than we expected - although I guess we could easily get a call in the future with a later date. We‘ll be keeping our fingers crossed"
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
"Thank you - we actually went in with a petrol in mind, but as you say the TDI Does complement the car and went for that in the end."
"Well, after what seems like a long wait, my car has been built and has been shipped to the UK.I'm hoping to be able to collect the car in around 2 weeks (waiting for it to be transported to the dealer), which would make it approx 12 months from order to delivery.I can't believe it's almost here - I'm very excited!"
Nice! My build date has moved from June 2023 to Jan 2023….Hopefully these q5 TFSnice! That gives me hope. Hopefully these q5 competition TFSIe models are starting to arrive. My build date has just changed from June 2023 to Jan 2023.
Has anyone had any previous issues where the car is waiting for shipment to the UK? Mine was built 31/10/2022 and was called off from factory stock to Transport on 01/11/2022 however I am told it is still awaiting shipment to the UK. Has anyone had any similar time frames? A month seems like an incredible amount of time just to wait for shipping.Thanks in advance
I got annoyed when I was told mine was still waiting for a ship in Mexico but it turned out it was actually waiting for a ship in Germany.
My order went in on the system 4th April and it is due to arrive with me on 9th December.According to the dealer it was built in week 39 (September 26th) and arrived at the supplying dealer on the 21st November so just over 8 weeks from factory to dealer.
"I think it takes about 2 months to go from build to then be ready for collection.My Q5 55 TFSIe was built on 03/10/2022 and I'm going to collect it from Audi tomorrow.Given that your car has to go from Mexico to Germany to the UK and the finally to the dealership, I'd say you've got about another 4 weeks until you'll be able to get your car."
"mattbrx said:I've only had three emails since my order was placed. Order placed on 11th April 2022. At time of order, estimated delivery date was 30th September.First email from Audi was from the Factory on 9th August 22, telling me that it was 'in build' and was about to start the build phase. Second email from Audi was on 25th August telling me the final checks had been done, and that it would soon be leaving the Factory. Third email was today, telling me it was already on a ship from Emden to the UK. So I think it was 5 weeks and 1 day from when they told me the build had finished to being on a ship to the UK. Have checked with my dealer and he has told me it will land in the UK tomorrow, and they expect it at the dealership on or around Tues 12th to Thurs 14th October. I'm collecting it on Saturday 15th October.So -Order > build start - about 14 weeks.Build time / time in factory - about 2 weeksLeave Factory > Emden - about 4.5 weeksEmden > UK > to me - about 2 weeks.So - 'In Build' email to collection date - 9 weeks and 4 days.Hope this helpsClick to expand...Thanks once again for this post, mattbrx.My Q5 journey has been pretty much exactly the same (10 weeks and 1 day from the 'In Build' email to collection date) so a good indication for other people."
Thanks everyone for your replies. Ive had no further updates since so hopefully it's more 8 weeks than 12!Thanks again
I have had the same change in build date and I got an update yesterday that it’s still on course for early Jan build. It’s reassuring to see someone else with the same info!
"Hi All,Glad to read that a lot of you already took the Q5 from the dealer and are riding with, it or soon will be.As mentioned earlier, I ordered mine TFSIe in September 2021 with delivery in November 2022, instead of receiving my keys, I was informed last month, that perhaps in May 2023 my car could be delivered (without Waranty....) up to 2 years of waiting - seems unbelievable!!Cheers"
Audi dealers get a limited allocation of cars and that could be an issue with your dealer?
"we received the in-build email from Audi today, so if things run in a similar fashion we should be looking at late Feb or early Mar ‘23 (40 TDI)"
Hi AllFinally had an update and due to receive my car this Thursday!! Only 13 month wait...Thank goodness. Has anyone had an immobiliser such as ghost or scorpion fitted since delivery?
"we had the ‘build and checks completed‘ email from Audi today, so I’m assuming it has - or is about to - be heading off from Mexico to Germany before heading to the UK.The dealer rang about an hour later and suggested it should be with them in 6-8 weeks, if it arrives at the very end of Feb we‘ll probably take delivery at the beginning of March just for the new-plate.it’s getting closer"
Just ordered and got told latest lead time is 17-22 weeks. I've spec'ed a towbar and there's no date on that so it could have big effect or none. No one knows currently.
"We had a call from the dealer today to say that our Q5 has just left Germany Heading to the UK - they expect it will be with them in 10-14 days, so mid-March is the outlook for handover."
They go to Germany from Mexico? I didn't know that!
"Yes, I’m not certain whether there are any further checks/work that goes on in Germany before heading to the UK - I understand they leave Germany from the port of Emden."
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Pretty sure they just unload the large car carrier at the port of Emden for distribution to different countries by smaller ships or trains.
"Hopefully the penultimate update, we received an email from Audi saying that the boat has landed in the UK and the car is starting its journey to the dealer on Road-transporter."
Yippee! arrived at the dealerjust sorting out a date next week to collect - big smiles all-round!
"I just did a quick check on the dates - the car has taken 20 weeks and 1 day from the order being placed to it being at the dealer, hopefully that will be of use to others (40 TDI). Everything done via our local dealer, no brokers etc. involved."
"I was quoted 17-21 weeks which will be about right if the following holds up :""Current Schedule Week 14 Build Unconfirmed - week beginning 3rd April 2023"""
"we didn’t receive info on the particular build-week (we didn’t ask either) - it sounds as though they have given you the right kind of overall expectations. It hasn’t seemed like a huge wait, particularly in comparison with some other brands.We are looking forward to picking it up next week, should be fun"
"Sounds good. I told my dealer to just let me know when he had a date for arrival at the dealers but he said he always updates customers every 2-3 weeks. When I ordered, the tow bar option didn't have a date so it could be it does or doesn't have an impact.VW told me 14 months!"
Very nice! Enjoy 😎
"Hi, I'm new to this forum. Have Edition 1 TFSIe 50 on order (ordered Oct'22 - build week looking like June'23). I've seen a few references to people receiving email updates from Audi UK - do you have to sign up for these, or do they arrive automatically. My dealer has been pretty good at keeping me updated, but would be good to know I'm getting all the info! Feel free to point me to another thread if that's a better place to ask this question..."
"Hi, welcome to the forum.we didn’t need to sign-up to anything special to receive the email updates from Audi UK, the first email we received was when the car entered the build-stage - so I’d guess your first one would be around June.someone else may be able to add additional info."
My salesman said he'd update me every two weeks or so. He did for the first month but gone quiet on me during the second month 🤷‍♂️
Heard nada from my sales person
"Thanks for letting me know - my dealer was good enough to be realistic about the order time. Once I'd decided on the Q5, also decided it was going to be OK to wait..."
"yep, that is the first email message we received from Audi themselves (rather than the dealer) - it was 2 weeks and 3 days later before we received the next update which confirmed the vehicle had been built and checked (which means it will soon begin its journey to Emden)"
"Great news, building long before estimate ""Week 14begins on Monday, 3 April 2023"""
"Potentially a couple of weeks earlier but we'll see. When I ordered, the system suggested that week with the exception of the towbar. That was unknown at the time. The dealer said it could make it worse, unaffect it or even bring it forwards."
Yours is the first I have heard of being built before estimate. Hopefully we have turned a corner
Now I've received an email from my dealer saying Week 14 Confirmed
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
I’m quite surprised reading this thread. I ordered a new Q5 40 TDI sline plus in 14th of February and reading many deutch threads the lead time is between 6 and 9 months or more. Here I’m discovering that it should be less and I hope that so much.I can only cross my fingers….
Welcome to the forum! Do you have a Q5 on order? 6-9 months would be longer than most have experienced in the UK recently although certain specifications could have longer waits.
"Yes, I have a Q5 on order.Q5 40 TDI sline plusChronos GreyCity packageBlack plus packageAudi Sport 20’ 54UComfort accessPremium care 2 yearsI hope that Italy and UK lead times are the same…"
"Great to hear some good news about build weeks coming forward.I may be wrong but I think the largest determinant of lead times overall is the engine choice. Far less time for TDI or TFSI; as I have a TFSIe on order, it means it's a looooooooong wait for me!"
Hi@ScottyUKdid you receive any update?Is the build phase finished?How long is it?
The email from the factory said its in build phase but my dealer has confirmed week 14 (w/c 3rd April). I think I've a couple of weeks to wait until its done then delivery is suggested by the dealer to be an extra 5-6 weeks. He said expect it early/mid May.
That’s must be frustrating. My has been in order well over a year now but is very close. It’s currently in Germany! I have just found out from my leasing company that I won’t have the matrix LED headlights. Has anyone else had this with a competition 55 TFSIe? I also don’t have a wireless charging mat which I am not really bothered about.They have offered me £400 but I would rather have the lights! After having waited so long I am just happy it’s almost here.
"Oh wow - has your dealer given you a build week yet? - and a factory status code? They should be able to check on their systems with Audi and at least tell you what they are, or why there has been such a long delay."
"You are experiencing lousy customer service. I ordered a 55 tfsi e and from order to delivery to me it took 10 months. The dealer can directly access the Audi customer sales computer and get you within a few minutes a build status. Going further, the Audi franchise can tell you quickly if there is a hold up and what is causing it. I have had the car from new since the beginning of August 2022. The only item not supplied was the wireless charging pad which I would not use anyway."
If I was in your situation I'd be talking to the Audi HQ of the relevant country rather than just a franchise dealer. That's not on.If mine turns up with key items missing e.g. matrix lights then I'll simply reject it.
Me too
Absolutely - things like matrix lights etc. are still listed on the Audi website as being available so it's just weird they're telling you they're not included.
I am sure your dealer will be laughing all the way to the bank if you decide to reject the car. Demand for Q5's well exceeds supply at the moment. If you really want the Q5 then negotiate a reimbursement package. Compromise is always the key.
"Today some update. My Q5 production date should be 20th week, so 15-21 of May. It seems that in Italy the lead time is a bit more than UK one: following the@ScottyUKexample my production date should have been 10-16 of April (my order was placed in 17th of February): anyway as usual it could change. I cross my fingers...."
I wonder if it's due to each country having an allocation of build slots. I'm just guessing.Good that you have a date now though 👍
"I think so. It's clear that Audi doesn't follow chronological order, in Germany it seems for example that the lead time is much longer."
I like these Audi Sport 8 J x 20 too much 😁 .... They are in my order with the combination Chronos grey and Black package plus
In the UK they're not an option on the trim level I wanted (s-line). They're on the next level up (Edition 1) but that trim comes with the blacked out styling pack that I didn't want.Got these and will then sell the standard 19 ones as new.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
"When I was ordered in late Jan I was told it would be built this week although they weren't sure if the towbar would impact this. I now know that the initial date was spot on :""In Production, awaiting confirmation of completion"""
"Haven't had the factory email yet but my dealer has just advised ""Great News, your New Audi has completed production and starting its journey to Stansted""By return i started making enquiries on a my23.5 spec car"
That's great news!
Stansted??? The first step goes to Emden then the UK. From build completion it takes between 5 and 7 weeks to get to the customer.
"Stansted Audi near the airport in Hertfordshire.So far they've been exact on dates. Dealer says 5-6 weeks from production and back in Jan said early/mid May for delivery. I'm impressed with their accuracy.They also said they'll fit my new 20"" wheels before I take delivery 👍"
"All is now clear. I have had Audi's for 40 years. My Q5 is my first and it wont be my last. I have 20"" wheels and they fill the wheel arch well and ride superbly in spite of our pot hole ridden roads."
"Do you know what tyres are being fitted on the 20"" wheels?"
In the UK they come with Pirelli Scorpion Verde (which i have) or Continental ContiSportContact5
In Italy the 54U has these main tyres:MICHELIN 592741 (255/45 R20 101 W) -> LATITUDE SPORT 3 AOPIRELLI 26382 (255/45 R20 101 W) -> SCORPION VERDE
Mine came from the factory with Pirelli's. They are a good tyre but slightly unpredictable near the limit in the wet or dry. The best tyres I have had are Hankook with the worst by far being Yokohama.
Update: yesterday I called my Audi dealer. My Q5 is confirmed for week 20 (now!) and it should arrive to Audi dealer week 28 (half July). 🤞🤞
"At what stage did you receive any build info and from who, do you mind me asking? I ordered mine last month and haven't heard anything, other than an update from my dealer saying due to be built in June, with a delivery of September sometime."
I got provisional build date from dealer when I ordered
"New member here.I ordered a Q5 Vorsprung on March 28th to replace my A4 Vorsprung. 10 days later the dealer phoned to inform me the order had been cancelled because of the MY23.5 release. Anyway, I now have a 45TFSI BE on order.Dealer phoned on Friday and informed me the build date would be November. They phoned again yesterday to say the build date is now week 29, which is July 17th. With a wing and pray delivery should be around September."
"Welcome. That was good of the dealer. I called mine and got the response ""oh I wondered if that would interest you"" but never bothered to let me know!Seems you may pip me to getting the car. I can only think it's my towbar that's added a few weeks."
Just thinking about this.They cancelled the order. That's odd. Normally they produce everything ordered to the spec.It seems you'll now miss out on air suspension and maybe other bits.
I did query it but their get out was there wasn’t a confirmed build date.Missed out on air suspension and running boards but got most of the other bits through the option packs. Came in nearly £5k cheaper than the vorsprung.
Confirmed date : on my '23 build that only arrived 9 days before the build date.No OLEDs either for you but plenty in the budget to cover the differences if you really want (except air suspension of course).It worked out OK for me. I was frustrated that I couldn't get a high spec car without going for full leather and blacked out. I don't want either. Now I can nearly get the car I want but my bill jumped up LOL
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
To be fair some of the features of the Vorsprung wouldn’t have been on my options list. I was looking forward to having air suspension though.
"That's the thing with these packages. I'm not a fan and would much prefer theaudi.deway where you can build the car you want and not what some UK Product Manager thinks you should have.It winds me up. We can't get heated steering wheels or the ventilated sears. Minimal choice of wheels, etc. Why should someone who potentially needs the 360 camera have to spend 4.5k to get it??Grrrrrrrr"
Welcome.I don't recall what the Vorsprung did or didn't get. The '23 models were supposedly I'm the chip shortage period although this didn't seem to affect some other countries and maybe not the Vorsprung.Fingers crossed for a timely delivery
My 23.5 build week (Unconfirmed) has just move back two weeks from w31 to w33. Hopefully i'll still have it before the end of Sept. It seems so far away 😢
That sucks and don't want to rub it in but my dealer just called and confirmed they have the car on site and will be ready for pick up next week as planned. He is meant to be sending some pics over of it so will share any if they do come through
Delighted for you.I would have had mine by now if I didn't reorder the 23.5
Collecting my new car on Tuesday
Great stuff! What did you order?
RSQ3 .................. for my wife
"Interesting choice, great little hot mini suv. Wish I could afford to get one but given the need to fit the family in with pushchairs etc, it just doesn't have the room as a Q5. Would like to see pics though even if this is a Q5 forum hehe 😀"
I needed something to replace the 911 >
"Mine was 'hopefully before Christmas', but this changed to 'due to be built in July with delivery in September'.That's all I know know so far."
👏 We want a pic as soon as possibile!
👏👏👏Awesone
Yay 👍Congratulations 👏
My Q5 is built! Just the long journey from Mexico (via Germany!) to go!
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
So late July/early August collection....or will you delay for a 73 plate?
"Could be August, but yet uncertain. Waiting for a 73 plate seems a good idea."
When I originally placed my MY23 order my saleman was saying 'we can sit on a car for a couple of weeks but would expect you to take delivery in a timely fashion'. I get they'd try and not have months worth of deliveries all building up but not sure there's much they can really do when push comes to shove.It was something I pondered when I ordered. Now I reordered the MY23.5 that's due to be built 1st week in August so prob late September for me anyway.
"I suspect you’re right, once the car is available it’ll be a case of ‘show me the money’!"
"Mine is still slated for build week 29, which is not very far away."
"Week 29 is very close - my dealer was good from the start in being realistic about lead times. I was told last autumn it would be built in June, and that's exactly what's happened."
Will be watching closely on how long delivery takes currently. My dealer says 5-6 weeks but that sounds optimistic to me despite them being good on all dares so far. Fingers crossed
I was told to expect at least 8 weeks. We’ll see what happens!
For Italy 6-8 weeks. In a week I’ll ask to my dealer some updates
How do you know it's built?
how do you know these things Scotty? How?
In Italy the information are given only by official dealers but it seems that in some other countries (for example here in UK) the factory sends you an email for each step.
"The factory sent me an e mail to confirm my build started, but nothing else. I had to chase dealer for info thereafter"
My dealer told me it was built - also have the VIN and engine number. I didn't get an email from Audi (haven't had anything from them so far!)
"this seems so hit and miss - look at@aaron- he is only getting info from his dealer, while other UK Audi Drivers are getting info direct from the factory - anyone know how or why this happens?"
My salesman checks the system every two weeks to see if there are any updates. Well he did but has just left. I now have a newbie
"News, news.... my audi dealer just called me: my new q5 will arrive Wednesday 😁 . Order executed in the middle of february: 4 and half months from order to dealer.Stay tuned"
That’s fantastic news!
Does it still have the transport chocks in the suspension? Looks high.
I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.
Yes. I try to turn on the instrument panel and I read the Message about transport mode active
"I received an email from Audi today informing me that my car is in build, this one week earlier than planned."
"Hi Fozzie, mind disclosing the email address the email was sent from please - so I can enquire with my dealer?"
"My Q5 is in the country! Should be ready for pick up by the end of the month. I was originally advised it would be September, so am really happy about this 😃"
"I just checked mine :mail@audicrm.co.ukIts the same one they use for Audi Presents, etc"
Do the setup on the website at home so when you go to the dealer they can add your car to your myaudi profile ....or something like that.
Mine came from the same address.
I haven't received a single email from Audi directly
There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. My dealer me told some of his customers receive emails and some don’t.
"Very nice, worth the wait?"
"Absolutely yes.Anyway I must say that I only wait 4,5 months from the order so I’m very satisfied"
My dealer just told me to expect 6-8 weeks for delivery via Emden after the build week.
"Well done Spinmar. Very happy for youGotta be honest, I'm now starting to struggle with my wait time."
"Can you remind me again when you ordered Aaron? I ordered mine on 19th April 2023, heard nothing other than ""download the App before your new car arrives""."
Cargo problemIt shouldn't be about any Q5/SQ5 but this could lead to delays in deliveries for problems in ports.
"To get to you the Q5 has a long journey, train, ship, ship, transporter and PDI."
Hopefully this car transporter ship fire will not impact other vehicles in transit to Europe.
"Welcome to our forumShould be the second from the car right side end in the row of fuse/relay panel B, the one in theECU box, under the wiper fluid funnel in the plenum chamber. .Fuse box diagram Audi Q5 and relay with assignment and location (fuseandrelay.com)"
"Hey mate , but it is for 8R or 9R as well?"
Suggest you look for that relay where I have suggested.
"Hi all, my 2022 model S-Line Q5 didn't have this option included. Ive been told by the dealer that the retrofit isn't doable for my car, I have the camera installed in the windscreen and also the Navigation so im wondering if anyone has any knowledge about what might be blocking it? could it be some extra control box or something?Stu."
Kufatec did do a plug in activation kit for this. Google this and you will find this.
Ooooft nice motor
"Very nice Missile!How long have you had the 911?I don't have any ride comfort issues with 21"" wheels on our SQ5 😏"
I personally have no issue with comfort but my missus says her ( . ) ( . ) get some work out
Suggest a Sports Bra? 😋😀Seems to be a red theme you have going on
I do like red <LOL>
"Chunx4t said:I was aware that the ride in the SQ5 was firm especially on 21"" wheels, and have to admit during my test drive I was more interested in testing the launch control and giving it the berries and on that alone the salesman didn't have to try too hard, anyway I was happy with the suspension from Comfort to Dynamic, the good lady not so much, she compared the ride to being ""as bad"" as my son's Evo and Type R from years ago. So being the doting husband I read many forums and car sites for a simple resolve, so bought her a set of 20's for her birthday...you can imagine her surprise. Anyway got them fitted and tried them out and the difference is overwhelmingly marginal, although on the positive side it is slightly less bone shaking, less chance of kerbing and potholes and driver annoying speed bumps are less of a challenge. I hope you find this review useful and save yourself a few quid by not buying a set of 20"" wheels for your wife's birthday. I have attached some foties just to let you see the difference between 21"" and 20"" wheelsClick to expand...Thanks for the post... Trying to decide what to do with my SQ5 firm ride on 21"" wheels."
"maybe I'm jaded by my Giulia QV, but I find the ride quality pretty soft/smooth in Comfort mode with the air-ride. Even my wife, who has significant back and neck issues, described it as nearly as comfortable as her Levante S. This being on factory 21s."
I find dynamic mode still too high. Anyone in London who has any software who can help? Any cons people are aware of? I did read in manual that car lowers at high speeds. Wonder if it lowers further in dynamic mode?
Read my thread about 10ish posts down.
"The one titled “OBDAPP, dongle and coding.”?If so looking for someone in London to help code ideally."
"Yes, my point being, that there’s only 2 options if you want to do it. Unless you find a somebody with Odis and a ramp."
Understood. Thanks 😀
"Hi,I've got an 18 plate Q5, owned from new. The brake clunk issue has become louder over time, and took it in to Volksmaster and they confirmed the remedy is the newer non-Bosch cylinder+servo, and nearly £1500 to fix it.My question is, even though the car is out of warranty, is there any mileage pursuing Audi for at least a contribution given I think it was recognised as a manufacturing defect that causes this? I'm assuming there's no safety concerns I can throw at them - I don't think it was ever an official recall...Cheers"
Do you have full Audi service history?Have you discussed with dealer?With his support it is worth a try
"Sorry for the newbie question... but if someone could clarify a few questions for me before I buy that would be great!- Does it have to be constantly plugged in to work?

"I've had a Carista for a few years, works a treat on the Q5."
"It’s awesome isn’t it! Not had a in-depth play with it yet, just the basics such as needle sweep and rear drl’s.what would you recommend changing?"
"It's about 4 years since I made any changes to my most recent Q5, so I can't actually remember! I did do those changes too though - rear DRLs always on was a must, and I love needle sweep."
I’ve look on the net and can’t find a video or any other info on a mk2How does the headlight come out / or how do you change the xenon bulbs??Is it a bumper off job. Or just the 2 screws either side of the light ??
You just loosen the right bolts to allow the headlight unit to slide forward giving enough room at the rear to open the plastic door with 2 metal clips and change the xenon bulb. There are loads of YouTube video guides: here
hiYer I’ve seen this video. It’s a mk1 though. I’ve got a mk2. It’s it the same process then ?I took the top bolts out either side but felt like something was holding it in still I could not pull it forward
"Yeah its probably similar. Cant find any Q5 mk2 videos, but there are some Q7 mk2 videos, so a Q5 mk2 is going to be something similar / in-between I would have thought -Q7 mk2 headlightNothing in your manual?"
Ooops
"I'm looking to source a '22 or '23 Audi SQ8 or RS Q8 with 10-20k miles on it, highest trim package available.

Welcome to our forum
Thank you!

Some areas to consider on this post, if not already seen before.ac problems - AudiWorld ForumsQ5/SQ5 MKI (8R) Discussion - ac problems - my ac stop working ,only blows hot air I have this error code from VCDS scan 00898 control circuit A/C compressor. 008 implausible signal any body know how to fix this problem? thankswww.audiworld.comHave you tried just topping up the gas in case low?Sent from my NE2213 using Tapatalk"
I've tried looking everywhere but none seem to address the compressor working when power is added to it. All fuses are good. Pressure in the system is the same on both high and low since the compressor isn't working. The pressure switch has signal and voltage. Both cooling fans kick on when AC is turned on.
"I had a similar problem on my wifes ford fiesta, i changed both the high and low pressure switches, then the fan worked but no cool air, then i found a bad relay that controlled the compressor, swapped it out now it works a treat, you may have the same fault"
Found it! One of the BCM1 fuses in the red block on the driver's side was blown. I've never seen a BCM with more than 1 fuse for it. Works awesome now!
"Blimey!There could have been many reasons the Q5 went on fire - not all vehicle related, but it would be good to find out from the fire-brigade if they had any inkling and then refer it to Audi?"
"Audi are carrying out forensic examination later this month to try and determine cause, ive since found other Q5 owners whose cars have also caught fire, one person suggested there dealership indicated circa 250 cars so far effected although I dont have data to back up that stat. Audi are definatley aware of this issue."
250 - if so it's huge!!
Welcome to our forumNice looking car.What did you drive before your Q5?Did you not test drive it before you purchased?I would suggest you discuss your concerns with dealer and ask to test drive / compare to a demo car.
"Thanks dude. I had a Merc CLA 220d, so I appreciate it was much lower and different.Test drive 15min on motorway only, wasn’t an issue I knew to recognise at the time."
"Hi I went from Land Rover Discovery Sports, Evoque and Merc E class into my first Audi- Q5 4.00TDI S line ( new in Aug 2023) - Ride is abysmal - my wife hates the car.However once you 'accept' the bumps and pitching and you push the car the handling is good - its the suspension that's too harsh for our roads."
"Sounds like it, the sway and bounce when taking even slight bends at 50mph+ is a little unsettling. I’m looking and thinking a rear sway bar is the best option."
Be interested to hear how that goes if you fit + cost.I had a demo which was great so cannot understand why my ride is so poor.Now have tyre pressures set on Audi 'comfort' setting which is 29 PSI- Drive modes have NO effect at all on suspension/ride just 'revs'.My car is in dealer today- 1st time- MMI keeps turning off/on.We are just waiting for lease to be up and - EXIT .
What you going to buy next?
We have another 29 months to goso will see what's around- don't fancy an EV yet- my son has one and range is not good.Would still want an SUV type car.
"IMALI said:Good to know it's not just me then. I literally just took it home on Tue. Don't get me wrong, I love the car - powerful 261bhp, lot's of tech, comfortable and silent drive but the handling issue is affecting my confidence in more spirited driving.Maybe I'll call the dealer today? I wonder if the 18 inch wheels are contributing - but yours must be 19 inch anyway? Mother-in-law has the same year S Line version so I defo need to take it for a spin to compare.The only bars I can find to support Q5 B9 chassis is034Motorsport Dynamic+ Sway Bar Bundle Package, B9/B9.5 Audi Q5/SQ5 - 034Motorsportbut only comes as a set, not cheap. I can't find any others.Click to expand..."
Yes mine has 19 wheels - it’s Sportsback and white as well!no way I am spending that type of money on an upgrade.Just have to put up with ride and wife’s moans & groans 🥵
H&R also do them. I've no idea about the difference etc
"So, I decided to check the tyre pressures today. They were all inflated to 39 PSI on 18 inch rims.. is that not ridiculous for an Audi dealer?? Brought them down to 30 PSI, surely that’s bound to make a difference now."
Any better ?
"Well, much better at low-medium speeds but still rubbish at 60+ mph.I think the only real solution is the rear sway bar which I would buy on its own in a heartbeat. Unfortunately it’s bundled expensively with the front which defo puts me off."
I had a similar issue in my Q5. I turned off the active lane assist by pushing that small on/off button in turn signal lever and handling is fine now. I took it to the dealer three times and they said everything is fine!

My dealer even airs my tires down to 29 psi I go home put them back to what I want !"
Thanks- I have followed your suggestion- left rears on 29 psi and put 34psi in fronts- steering is lighter + smoother over bumps- but only tried locally.Will this adversely affect tyre wear on fronts?Again thanks for guidance.
"I bought the H&R stabilizer bars for Audi Q5 the difference they were made out spring steel ( Chrome Moly ) where some are carbon steel the spring steel are more forgiving and follow wave bumps much better than carbon steel , Addco stabilizer bars are carbon steel had those on my Toyota FJ and a Ford Aerostar mini van I think carbon steel works better on tall vehicles and Chrome moly ( spring steel ) on cars or short SUVs . Just my personal opinion from experience with both ."
"Considering the fender gap, I would have a closer look inside the wheelarch - maybe dealer forgot to remove transport spacers in the suspension."
I had that mistake on my PDI
"I bought one too and can't believe how stiff the rides is. You feel every bump and heaven forbid you go over speed bumps in a mall, my whole body moves. Terrible car. I'lll be taking quite a loss to dump this thing."
You did not test drive?
"Hi guys. In my previous a4 saloon, I had handles in the rear shelf which were handy for bags and shopping. In the q5 things just slide around. Any recommendations on what to get? It is a hybrid and has the four anchor points in the corners only, not rails. Thanks"
"You can get foam bars about 2"" Square with velcro on the bottom pretty or use a luggage net or you can retro fit the rails (around £1k) or get a container to out them in or....P.s. I retro fitted those spring up handles in my old S4 saloon. Really useful. In the q5 you even lose one of the hooks is you have air suspension or toe bar. Not the best"
"I bought one of these, to stop the weekly shopping from being splayed all over the boot area:Fortem boot organiserDoes a reasonably effective job and the dividers can be changed around to suit what you are carrying."
Thank you. I didn’t mention the car came with a boot liner which is handy for mess but things slide around. Also will not allow Velcro with this in. Interesting you retro fitted the handles! What did you fix them to?
Thank you. Might be just what I need
That is clever DIY
"Honestly, not really. They were already on some models (don't know which as the S4 was the top of the range in the B6 - maybe it was an option) so I just got the part numbers and fitted them. If I remember correctly I even ordered genuine screws and fastener clips 😀"
"Neat idea, but sadly of no use in a Q5."
Yep. The flexibility of a hatch can also be a negative e.g no rear compartment security. My saloon even had locking rear seats needing a key to put them down.
"I use one of those elastic trunk nets and simply have it hooked to the 4 anchor points. I'll place it over groceries and such to keep them from sliding around too much. If I have something I'm worried about breaking, there's a hook on the right hand side of the hatch where I can hang something. I just did that with a package of blueberries that I wanted to protect from some cases of water. It's not huge, but it works. I imagine one could DIY a hanging bar that goes where the privacy cover goes and hang things from that. Or for that matter, if someone make a rear strut brace for the Q5, you could install that and tell the spouse that it's a grocery hanging bar..."
Nice. Thanks for pics
I was thinking net too. Do you have a link to one
"I have a net which I’m selling, I’d like £25. I’m happy to list on eBay if you would like some buying security."
Thanks for pic. Handy to know you clip to back of seat. Markygee wasn’t using his net and sold me his so I’m up and running soon.
If you cant see any scews on the inside its probably glued on. Some gentle warming with a hairdryer should probably loosen it to allow you to carefully pry it off.Nice flipflops / sliders in the reflection!
"After looking at it, I'm pretty confident its only held on with glue, I think i'll leave it on and get it wrapped - id rather that get damaged than the boot lid and me having to repair it!Very well observed... open to offers if you are interested, they stink but to some people that's added value!"
"Hi all ... New member here, and joined to ask the experts and owners of Q5's and SQ5's a serious questionYesterday my son hit a kerb, prob doing no more than 40 mph as had just come away from a set of traffic lights, in his SQ5, relatively side on and his front alloy completely snapped, causing the car to skid along the road as the wheel had completely come off. His rear wheel had dents and scuffs, but no more damage. Is this usual, as I cannot see a great deal of evidence of alloys actually snapping clean off.I have photos of this if anyone wants further details, but as he has only had the car 3 weeks, so maybe there may have been previous damage to the wheel. He bought the car from one of the largest Audi dealers in London and not some back street dealer... hopefully you guys can shed some light on this."
Welcome to our forumIs this an OEM wheel?Audi alloy wheels are quite strong and it takes considerable impact to break them.Not sure what advice you are looking for?It would be difficult to prove wheel was previously damaged​Unreasonable to expect dealer to replace the wheels (& tyres).​​Sh1t happens​
"Just wondering if anyone had ever seen this before.... know that dealer cannot be held accountable, but hope that they would be as shocked as I was that this would break, and look into where it came from, and do something if even to spare their reputation. Looking to ask insurance company to test the wheel, for previous cracks etc, as you say sh1t happens, but paying 35k plus for a car you'd expect the wheels not to snap, being an Audi alloy... maybe a cheap fake yes, but not a genuine Audi..."
You could DIY for cracks using Dye Penetrant Inspection test kitDye Penetrant Inspection (DPI) – Applied Inspection Ltd
"Having experience of having been down mechanical engineer and metallurgist experts reports on a failed component, get these first. Do not let the items out of your possession until obtained. Continuity is vital. This will provide the necessary evidence for any claim. A decent claim specialist solicitor is also recommended.The details of the speed, loss of control and road situation appear unusual to have caused such damage, unless you have dashcam footage.Good luck."
"In a former life, I did failure investigation. I would start with a close examination of the fracture faces. This may reveal evidence of casting defects, prior cracking or failure as the result of a single event."
"An interesting calculation is to examine the weight of the vehicle, multiplied by the speed to assess the impact force on the rim of the wheel, spread over perhaps 6 or so square inches. The kinetic force would be likely in excess of the manufacturers specification of manufature.Imagine an alloy wheel, fixed at the centre having a 75 ton weight pressed on the rim. Or a 2+ ton weight dropped at 40 mph on the rim. I cannot imagine many manufacturers alloy wheels would be expected to do anything other than snap.Another parameter I have just thought of is the diameter of the rim. The larger size would increase the torsional stress on the spokes."

I plugged the VCDS in and the fault is no voltage and no communication.the original sensor had a part number of 8R090780A Which seems to be for 2014-2016 modelsSo does that last letter mean there is a difference or have i got a faulty new sensor.Any ideascheers"
"Have you contacted supplier, what do they say?"
"Well i have put my part number into their search bar and the same part comes up with the G on the end so it looks like a compatible partbut they could be wrong, i mean would Audi make muliple versions of the same part that only fit certain cars?, there is a 5 wire plugthat connects to the module, would they swap the wires about, i wouldn't put it past them"
"Like all manufacturers Audi will update parts as and when improvements are identified.Sorry, but I don't understand why you blame Audi when you chose to use an alternate supplier.

Does any have issues with turbo lag? I just did a test drive in a 2023 Q5 Premium Plus (in the US) and noticed quite a bad delay between hitting the accelerator and really moving. It’s so slow to respond. Definite initial movement but slow. Does pick up eventually. Is this normal? I so wanted to like this and would have bought it otherwise.
Welcome to our forumI suspect you might have been in economy mode?
As missile suggests check what driving mode you are in in the Audi Drive Select. Also don't go flooring the throttle until the car is up to operating temperature (minimises wear on the engine etc)
Audi's don't run-in until at least 5k miles. Test drive a Q5 with more miles on the clock. If you are testing a DSG variant then try the paddles.
Nice one for those with cars that support it

Just had this recall campaign notification pop up in the myAudi app. A quick Google search didn't come up with anything and there's no safety recall on the .gov.ukwebsite. Will get in touch with dealer on Monday. Anyone had this or know the background?
Further search produced this result from the States:-LinkEngines with the fault present when the oil filter is checked for metal particles need replaced!
This relates to poor quality control on dimensions of the con rods
Hmmmm…. That sounds rather concerning! I hope your car has a clean bill of health upon inspection.The example filter element pictures do show a clear problem (much more than you expect during initial running-in - I know they don’t officially call it running-in any more!) I’d want to be assured that in the event of a future problem the dealer will treat you honourably. If there are many cars failing the inspection dealers will need alot of new enginesfingers crossed yours is all good 👍
Thank you. I agree that future symptoms should also be covered for such a major known issue. A new engine on a nearly new car would be a bit of a shocker.
"My 2023 Q5 is my first Audi purchased since the 1980's ""60 Minutes TV Show"" unintended acceleration situation....at that time I had leased a new Audi 5000 turbo.Finally enough time has passed, lol, and I purchased my second Audi. About a week into ownership of this 1315 Campaign announced itself and like many I became concerned. I love the fun element of driving this Q5 and just hope that very few of us have to deal with an engine replacement. I just cannot understand how Audi QC incoming inspection of components allowed engine assembly(s) in the first place. This situation certainly plants considerable insecurity in my mind as I contemplate remaining with the Audi brand in the long term."
I’m a bit surprised that they don’t know in which chassis numbers they have fitted the faulty batch of con rods.
I agree with you.......surely the powertrain final assembly does perform some incoming six sigma vendor inspection via random sampling........rather than just reach into crates and use any/all con rods with no review. Many years prior a different OEM was having bearings provided by a vetted vendor....and that authorized bearing vendor did sub out some of the bearing sourcing to a third party and significant transmission failures were the result of that event.

"Sure, I will let you know."
"There's no specific mention in the USA recall details about petrol or diesel engines. Do Audi USA sell diesel Q5's.The report says they are recalling certain 2021-2023 Audi Q5 and Q5 Sportback vehicles. The engine connecting rod bearings may become damaged, which can result in engine failure. Reports claim the USA recall is for around 74,000 vehicles of which Audi/VW expect about 2% to be affected so requiring a new engine."
"I was at the car service today. In my case, everything is fine. The inspection took about 2.5 hours. No presence of any metal particles."
ty for info……same timeframe and result when my inspection was done……..now I just hope for best going forward because this Q is fun to drive and also comfortable.
"Also had the recall procedure performed last week on my 2023 Q5. Only 1350 km on it.Good news though. All clear - ""no signs of metal / debris. No further actions required""."
Good News 👍
Just picked up my Q5 which was in today for the recall. The oil filter was checked for metal particles and was totally fine. They completed the work in about 3 hours. The service rep mentioned that the dealership hasn't had any affected vehicles fail in the 6 months they've been doing this recall.
Good news
I wonder if this could be to do with the correct running in procedures not being followed.
Just had this recall campaign notification pop up in the myAudi app. A quick Google search didn't come up with anything and there's no safety recall on the .gov.ukwebsite. Will get in touch with dealer on Monday. Anyone had this or know the background?
The cause is a batch of con rods slipping through which were not to the correct size resulting in engine wear or failure with a risk of fire.
At least it is not a driver generated fault.
"No, it is poor quality control of dimensions"

They usually only take a collapsing space saver not a full size wheel. Collapsing means that the side walls aren’t fully formed so need pumping up before fitting otherwise they are too tall to fit in the boot space.
Try ebay.

I have since gone tomodernspare.comand bought a replacement “donut” (the skinny temp tire) with a jack and the whole thing is in a handy bag that can be carried in the back for those long trips or off pavement/no cell service times when you DONT want to rely on that useless goop.

Also to make things difficult that electrical line splits off and connects to another sensor that’s near the idle pulley, which I don’t know how to take off without breaking it to get myself some more room to work.I’m hoping somebody reads this thread and has some experience with changing out this harness and can help me deep in the current harness and re-attach the new one, even if I can’t remove that other connection to get myself some more flexibility."

Welcome to our forum
I can't believe anyone would fit smaller discs. You would need to change move than just the disc.You should always replace pads with new discs.Phone any reputable supplier or your friendly Audi dealer with your Registration or VIN number and they will confirm what you need.
Rang audi and they said it does not show the size on the computer. Can only tell me the prices. I'm no closer to finding out.
Ask audi for the part numbers for your car. From the part numbers you can research replacements.

"Got my eight digit code last week but when I put in details it just says ""please wait a few moments while we find your order"" ....................and nothing further, like it's frozen?"
"Does the myAudi page recognise your reference order number? If not ask your dealership to check your order number, I had the same problem turns out the last to digits were the wrong way round."
Got mine last week and it says there is no record. Dealer tells me it was built last week!
my order number does not work either and the dealer is not really bothered to help me out on this
"Yea it seems to recognise the number as when you put another number in it soon tells you its wrong.My dealer is looking into it for me tomorrow, I will let you know how I get on."
"Not sure which browser you guys are using but IE was a bit patchy when I used it, Chrome worked fine though ......................"
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"Firefox and Safari, It just keeps say finding order but then does not progress any further"
My order number is now also working which is a bonus. My order is now in Quality control phase. So hopefully it won't be long now i guess.
"Good to hear you are now able to track your order, when was your build date?"
how do you find that out ?
"Hi baron02, try clicking on the order received tab if still active should give you your production start date."
"@ baron02 - it's (the tracker) not fully up to speed with what you have ordered (as it is still in ""Beta""?); mine had several things ""missing"" but no worry, they were all there when built as spec'd"
its probably a software glitch a quick call to your dealer to put your mind at rest
"Thanks Jules, I will give the dealer a ring or a visit, Just to put my mind at rest. I was pretty sure that the dealer emailed me the other week and told me that the build week was week 47. Don't know how long it takes for them to build the car."
"No probs baron02, week 47 is this weekhas your dealer given you an approximate delivery date? My build date is week 50, delivery Week commencing 4th Jan."
"I would guess the tracker is a tad out of date, fingers crossed your car is on the ferry, your dealer should know the status."
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"That good jules, mine now shows In the Uk. So fingers cross it will be at the dealers by end of the week"
guys - what seems to be the current wait time for a new Q5? used to be 4 months minimum.
"My Q5 was ordered on 11th October, if it turns up for the end of the month it will be between 14/15 weeks."
surely you mean 10/11 weeks?
"I have been given a number by the dealer but when I put it in with my postcode it says nothing found, but dealer tells me it is starting being built 4th week of 2016 so I should get it 1st week in March fingers crossed"
any order now is going to be delivered in March - 16 plate i guess?
"I would think so rifleman, I had the dealer build slot which was sept order, and it was built on week 16 Nov."
"Lol nice one, sold my Merc today so it's full time peddle power for the next 2 to 3 weeks.."
"Well my Q5 left Ingolstadt on the 12th of December, my dealership or Audi UK are unable to give any further updates as to its whereabouts, howmany weeks does it normally take to deliver after leaving the factory?"
It takes around 7-9 working days to get from inglostadt to getting on the ferry. it goes into a holding area before they release it for the ferry. As you are in Essex area it will come in through Sheerness. The last ferry came into Sheerness on the 23rd Dec that has a consignment of VAG cars. You will know when it is on the ferry when the tracker says it in the UK.
"baron02 many thanks for the info, its now been 18 days since my Q5 left Ingolstadt!! How do you find out the shipping dates?"
anyone know how soon you can track your Audi?i ordered mine 16 Dec but my dealer still has no tracking info he can provide me with?
I could track mine as soon as I got the order number from the dealer ......................
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
I ordered mine on 14th Nov and I still can't track mine either
Lanerboy I don't think you have the correct number it's not the one on your sales invoice my salesman had to obtain from there sales team.
Julesthe number I am using is the 8 digit no the salesman gave me when I asked for it ??
"Ask your salesman to check the number, I had the same problem last two numbers were the wrong way round."
I ordered Mid - Late Dec (Through DTD) & was able to check last weekend.They are supposed to be starting to Build on 25th Jan.Does anyone know how long from build (Roughly)They have told me ready Late March.
"My build date was 7th Dec, collection from the dealer should have been 2nd Jan, however due to delays leaving Ingolstadt and factory Christmas shutdown until 18th Jan, delivery at best will be around 1st week of Feb so for me around 9 weeks."
A few days back I checked the tracker and mine was still due to commence construction on 11/1/16. Just had a look and it's now showing in quality control awaiting shipment.Is this usual or maybe a sign of reduced/cancelled orders?
"SteveMcB, the online tracker is a bit hit and miss, contact Audi UK customer services, they will be able to give you an accurate build status. I experienced a 10 day error, according to the tracker on the12th Dec my Q5 was on its way to Bremen Port, however it didn't actually leave the factory until the 22nd this was confirmed by Audi UK."
"Thanks Jules, tbh it would probably suit me if it arrives towards the end of Feb, otherwise I'll be tempted to get it on the road as a 65 instead of a 16."
"Lol that thought has already crossed my mind, Feb is a short month for the sake of three weeks I may hold out for a 16 plate."
got my tracker working now - Ordered 19 Dec 15 - expected Start Build date of 25 Jan 16.
"Rifleman, I ordered on the 17th & Have the same build date.I wonder who will get theirs 1st !How far is your dealer from you ?Mine is 135 miles."
how come I have a build date of last week in Jan when I ordered 11th Novalso my audi tracker doesn't workspoke to dealer and he sent me copy of the order for assurance ????????
"I contacted Audi Uk customer services several times and they told me that my order would be delayed but it wasn't. I would not believe everything Audi uk say. Did they specifically say Bremden port, Emden is usually the port they leave from.."
"Hi Lanerboy, my dealer sent me a copy of the paper invoice listing the full car spec and price. He later emailed another PDF copy which also had the build no. hand written across the top.I could be wrong but I seem to recall that he had to contact Audi to get it."
"Hi baron02, my mistake and your correct Emden port, the delay is down to the factory on Christmas shutdown until 18th Jan my car will not be released until then :-( I have been given a loan car until mine arrives."
"Dealer just phoned me, he thinks it could be available in a couple of weeks, it's going to be tough waiting until March."
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"Today's the day my SQ5 Plus was expected to begin construction, no change on the tracker as yet so it will be interesting to see when and if anything changes."
"Audi factory is currently on shutdown it reopens on Monday 18th, my Q5 has sat at Emden port since the 22ndDec:-("
"So much for the tracker keeping the customer appraised of the progress of build.Still showing expected to begin construction on 11 Jan, but just been on live chat and told the tracker does not accurately reflect the actual state as it is now expected to commence build 18 Jan."
"Just checked tracker and, if it can be believed, mine is now in the UK, must be the same boat."
"Steve, our Q's are keeping each others company across the North Sea they will be docking at Sheerness 4:00 pm tomorrow ;-)"
Are you hanging off for a 16? Don't know if I can exercise that much restraint!Just need to get the Polo sold now.
"My head says I should hold out for a 16 my hart says I should just get on and drive it, it will probably end up been the latter.."
"brilliant news. here is the shipping schedule for jan / feb, will be interesting to know which vessel will do African highway run as this ship will need to dry dock shortly."
"Hi baron02, many thanks for the shipping schedule very much appreciated."
"LanerboyHopefully I can, if creeps in to Febuary I'll have a pretty good argument problem is I've already sold my car, dealer has loaned me a car for the time been I'm Sure they will want it back as soon as my Q5 has had its PDI and ready for delivery."
"Just checked - on it's way to Perth, the next 6 weeks will drag, I'll probably be tempted to go and visit it, it's only 40 miles after all!"
The eagle has landed - 38 days and counting
"Mine has just jumped straight from order received to quality control today??? as said above shows how accurate progress keeping isnt!!!Must admit Steve McB If I were you I would be tempted to get it before the new reg if its ready early Feb.I am now thinking the same, how long from quality control to delivery to dealers?."
"Steve, Mine is due into Ipswich tomorrow.j1sgo, providing there's no delays in QC i would say 4 weeks at best."
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"Getting fed up of seeing the same thing on the tracker I rang Audi Customer Service for a better update and was told that production would commence ""this week"". No further movement until today where it has appeared in quality control.Customer services told me the tracker was usually reliable and I should contact the dealer as they would have more up to date information. The dealer checked yesterday and it was not even order confirmed on their system!!"
"According to the tracker mine went into QC on the 7th, 4 days before they were due to start construction, apparently it's at Perth now so 2 weeks give or take.Severely tempted to get it asap but will try to hang off until March, 29 days in Feb this year :-("
"My dealership are doing a midnight handover on the 29th Febuary I'm holding out until then, going to pop over there Saturday morning to take a look before going into storage."
"I'm hopefully collecting mine midday on the 29th and taking it home (as it came off the transporter with all transit protection intact) on trade plates, then on the 2nd take it for it's new car valet."
"Apart from being in quality control 4 days before they were due to build it (I like to think of this as being incredibly efficient) mine was accurate when it came to being on the ship, in the uk and at the dealer."
"Oh thats good then I might get it for beginning of March then, what do you think are the chances for 1st March"
I'd say 100%.
"just looked through my build data regards all my options and i can find everything EXCEPT the ""audi drive select"" this is on my build sheet off the dealer but i cant find it on my audi tracker build page, this has now got me worried could it be listed under something else ?????"
"Out of curiosity I just checked my build data on the tracker and ADS does not appear anywhere, like your's it's on the dealer build sheet though."
"Hopefully good news for you Lanerboy and not bad news for the 3 of us - just checked and it's not listed on mine either. I was overwhelmed today and didn't notice if the button was there or not. Emailed my dealer, he'll be back on Saturday so hopefully will confirm what the script is."
Dealer has confirmed the button is there.
After now discovering my car is actually on a ship instead of just starting to be built is there any way of finding out which ship it may be on so I can track the ship to see where it is and where its docking if I new the ship name I could track it on Marine traffic appcheers
"If your vehicle is on ship, the ELBE departed Emden this morning and is due into Grimsby tomorrow at 20:00. I think the dealer can find out what vessel it is on!"
Not sure when it left Germany my tracker just says this
Don't have any pics but it's above the driver's side heater knob. If you look at auto trader there's a white SQ5 plus with good photos of the dash
"As a matter of interest, how long did your's sit in ""quality control"" before moving to ""in transit""? Mine's been 8 days now in QC!!!!!!"
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
mine sat in QC for best part of three weeks before it was releast for transit.
Mine went to QC on the 21st Jan and changed to transit today - using that as a basis yours should change Monday?
"Thanks for that info, I'll just have to wait and see what Monday brings!!"
"Mine is week 6 build (1st Feb) but it's still showing as ""Your SQ5 is expected to begin construction on 1st February 2016"".So will see if it can get to me for 1st March."
"Yes it's the same story for me.I can confirm that it's something that the system doesn't pick up. I had around 5 things added last minute, and everything got added on the Audi tracker except for the ADS and Audi Advance Parking.These are just for some reason things the system can't find/add. Actually my running boards are not showing up either but I think that's because they where super last minute, and where done as manually request so won't show on the system."
"Not too far off, it showed as ""Your Audi has left Ingolstadt"" first thing this morning"
Mine had a build date of 25th Jan & has not changed with a delivery date of 22nd March & also like others the ADS & Parking system Avanced not showing & I have not changed the spec at all since ordering.
"Mine changed to ""leaving Germany"" on 28th Jan anyone know how long it takes before it changes to ""your car is in the uk"""
Will change to in the UK once loaded onto the ship then a further 2 days after leaving Emden before landing in the UK.
cheers Jules once it docks in the uk what is the time to the dealers from then
From docking at Sheerness to Ipswich was 6 days..
"I thought going away for a few days would ease the pain of waiting for the tracker to change but it's not to be. The wonder of wifi and tinternet mean instant access at all times wherever you are to keep the frustration building. The other problem is being out of sync with the U.K. due to the 8 hour time difference.Oh well, At least I have the Chinese New Year celebrations to look forward to!!!"
"My order has now changed to "" your audi is in the uk "" anyone know time scale to the dealers from now dealer is Crewe Audi"
"Thats excellent news, my best guess would be 7-10 days, are you going to wait for the new 16 plate?"
yes will definitely wait for a 16 plate would be daft not to
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
I've been invited to a midnight handover on the 29th
My dealer wont do that ggggrrrrrr
"Screw that, i'd go up in the morning."
"Hi EveryoneI am trying to track my new SQ5 plus on the myAudi tracker, it is due to be born build week 7 but it does not recognise the order number and or post code. I checked with the steelers this morning and he claims it is the right 8 digit number. Can you actually track the car before its built or do you have to wait until it's been built? Apologies if some of you guys will be repeating yourselves but your help would be appreciated."
Mine didn't show on the tracker straight away
It was ordered 8th Jan?
"Yes you can still log in to your account, you will be greeted with a welcome screen, I would be inclined to give Audi customer services a call they will be able to conform your 8 digit order reference number."
I ordered mine after that and it was a cancelled order from End of November and took a couple of weeks to show up. Give the dealer a call though as he may have put the wrong postcode down or something.
"My order has changed to "" your Audi is on its way to Crewe Audi "" so it must be off the ship now"
Finally - today it jumped five steps from 'Order Received' to 'Quality Control' in 3 days. Build started on 8th Monday (build week 6).
This morning it has changed to 'In Transit' with the status of - Your Audi has left Ingolstadt.
"Now for the excruciating will it - won't it arrive as hoped.Have seen ""your Audi has left Ingolstadt"" since 2 Feb and counting!!"
"It should take between 2/3 weeks to arrive in the UK/Dealer, as far as I've been advised.I'm getting a new car detail too, I've asked them not to wash or even touch the car including leaving the protective film on it.P.s LED interior lighting is standard on the SQ5 Plus."
"The only interior LEDs which are standard on the plus are the footwell lights, all others are incandescent bulbs. I know because I checked them all out when I delivered a plus to Durham a few weeks back."
"The interior light package gives you all the interior lights as listed on the configurator, what it does not say is just which ones are LEDs. This was exactly the same for the last A4s. As for a nice refund you yourself pointed out they are standard on the SQ5 Plus, I received a partial refund on an A4 I specced with the ""LED"" light pack, but I was paying for it as an Extra.Not sure on rules for advertising so will pm you with my supplier."
"One step further, this morning the tracker has moved on to tell me ""My Audi is in the UK"". Now I can relax a little and not have to contemplate rescheduling my new car detail booked for 2 Mar."
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"I received the same email today as Lanerboy, bit strange that they inform you about the order being accepted when the car is almost here!"
"We're on a roll now, overnight the tracker has changed to tell me ""Your new Audi is on its way to Kings Lynn Audi""Retention document arrived yesterday from DVLA so no hold ups on that front this time around."
I got the same email from Audi UK that they have received my order & my dealer has confirmed that my car is there !!Lets hope ALL our orders are as ordered.
Very envious of all you guys with your cars almost here!Mine has a build date of 29th Feb delivery April 1st!The wait is killing me already!
"Mine has been built and is showing as in Quality Assurance for a couple of days now. Could be there for a week according to tracker. Still really excited even though it is my second SQ5, albeit a Plus this time.Anyone have any idea as to when it's likely to arrive at the dealer?I have ordered a couple of extras over the last one, just to make it a little different.All the best,ZED"
Now the painful wait of two weeks till it gets to March. I'm not sure you can pick your 16 plate yet... The DVLA only releases something like 7 plates a week to the dealer for the car to pick from. That's what I've been advised by the sales person anyway.
"I got to pick mine at the beginning of Feb, there was a list of about 20, not that there was anything exiting to choose from admittedly."
Oh I have just emailed the dealer to ask about number plates.Not had a reply yet.I am thinking of buying a private plate on in 2-3 months but like other don't want a silly one for the few months that it is on.
dealer called me to tell me i am looking good for 1st March woohoo!
"Excellent news rifleman, is your dealership doing a midnight handover event?"
i'm not too sure - i like seeing things in daylight to be honest lol.
"New message on the tracker this morning, it's changed from""Your new Audi is on its way to Kings Lynn Audi""to""Your Audi has arrived in the UK""Too many calls being received at customer services about the time taken to arrive at dealers?????"
My new SQ5 Plus has just left the factory.Does anybody have any idea as to when it is likely to arrive at the dealer in Aberdeen?
Took mine 2 weeks to get to Perth
Thanks mate. Insomnia is beginning to set in. EXCITEDZED
I've been waiting for so long now that I almost feel as if the novelty of owning a new car has worn off already - and I've not even got it yet!
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
Checking the shipping schedule my Plus should arrive in Grimsby tomorrow.
"Hope you're luckier than me in getting it out of there. Mine arrived in Grimsby on the 16th and it is still sitting there. The dealer tells me it is scheduled for ""sometime next week"". No definite day so I have had to reschedule the new car detail it was booked in for to the following week"
"Hi Guys, Sorry if this has been covered, How long from Quality control to arriving at dealer would you say?"
Mine must be a real bag of bolts then!
"Informed today that mine is booked for delivery to Kings Lynn on Wednesday, so 15 days on the docks at Grimsby. If your vehicle has a transportation order raised against it, the dealer can find out when it is due delivery."
"Just spoke to dealer she said around 4 weeks! No transport order yet, Gutted the wait is killing me!!!"
"I've been given the order number, but when I check, it reports that order received but the quoted spec does not match much of what I've ordered.Dealer informed but as yet no response.Did other members find this also, I just expected it to fire back the Audi code with std and options ordered for my carOtherwise means Audi number/configurator is a bit of a waste of time if there is no tie up.IanS"
Mine was a 100% match to what I ordered.... I should follow up with the dealer just in case!
"My SQ5 plus, according to Tracker left factory about two weeks ago. Status has not changed since. I am getting a little impatient. Any one have any idea as to where it is likely to be now? It's taking its time to get to the port for onward trip to UK. Deliver planned for mid March. Has anybody got a build in week 6 and if so, what progress has it made in terms of when do you anticipate delivery?Any comments are greatly appreciated, before I get back to the dealer!Best regards,ZED"
I bet your car is very close now.Mine is at the dealers & I was told late march.
"ZEDBACK said:My SQ5 plus, according to Tracker left factory about two weeks ago. Status has not changed since. I am getting a little impatient.

"Thanks for that. I am greatly encouraged!! The car is at Emden port, I now hear. Maybe you're correct in your assessment of the position. Hope so.ZED"
"Contacted dealer, he was working from last but one code.Still odd don't see the code anywhere, and format of this is different to the configurator which makes it harder to check all is as it should be. I printed off configurator PDF and found each option in the web portal list just to be sure,Dealer states additional items added but code stays the same, otherwise would loose the allocated build slot.All seems a bit open to errors.IanS"
my order doesn't show my Running Boards but the dealer has emailed me a screen shot of his order system screen that has been accepted by Audi and he assures me 100% that it will all be fine and the order tracker is frequently slightly 'out'. I will take his word for it and I have the written proof........just in case it arrives without the boards!!!!
I will be taking delivery next Monday 14 March. What I originally thought was build week 6 was in fact week 8. Cannot wait.ZED
Mine is on the water!!! Not long now!!!
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
"Update: Car confirmed as now arrived into the UK and should be at dealership next week. PDI means collection available from early the week after, but sods law means I'm out of the country, so collection deferred until 1/4."
"Watched the video of my car today a 'Sneaky peek' as they call it.All looks ok thus far - wheels right colour, side step is on it, calipers are red so looks like no clangers for me fingers crossed.Only thing I noticed is I don't have a silver centre wheel cap, actually I don't have one at all. Hopefully it's just something they need to add at the dealer and is normal."
"Mats, first aid kit, wheel caps and book pack will be in the boot along with the roof rails. Centre caps will be fitted as part of PDI."
Picking mine up Tuesday 15th.Although the V5c Arrived yesterday & I only transferred funds on the same day ! (I was at work so did not know it had arrived till I arrived home !)I too got Sneak peek but not much !!
Thread Resurrection- can we still track orders?
I have been unable to track mine. Told it was in build nearly three weeks since and then radio silence. :-(
great news! be sure to post a pic here so we can all be jealouswhen did you order?enjoy!
but how do you track your order nowadays>?
I suppose that only Audi dealers can track it. otherwise you have to wait the audi mails about the various phases. In usa there is a man Who can track it in the forum (audizine) but only usa orders
When I ordered my first and second Audi Q5's (2013 & 2016) in the UK we were able to track them from inception to shipping - and even discover what ship they were loaded onto.
How did you track it?
"Years ago:You were able to track car through production and collect your car from Ingolstadt.Unfortunately, no longer. Progress?"
"Sadly, like most things, we are being dragged backwards."
Please tell how you did that ???????????
You had to pay to collect it though. I was tempted but had already had the experience of visiting the museum and restaurant courtesy of Audi so re-doing it to get the next car didn't seem worth it. Nice for those that did. Would be a little odd collecting a Mexican car from ingolstadt though
"It still is a no cost option for those living in Germany.European Delivery ""5 percent discount on most models, a one-night hotel stay, ground transportation, and breakfast and lunch on delivery day"". See Here >Audi kills its European Delivery option - AutoblogMy most recent order is an RSQ3. Those are still made in Germany."
"Has anyone used this service to track there new car orders, all you need is your 8 digit order number and post codehttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/youraudi/youraudi.html#/yourAudi/dashboard"
Handy if in GermanyIs the 5% available on top of any negotiations or only if your paying list? I've got 16% off. I know the dealer hasn't got 5 points left to play with but Audi may have.
"I guess there is still a deal to be had, if you happen to know someone working / serving in Germany.""European Collection"" is no longer available."
What do we do with our order number?
Not a lot. Its just proof it's in the system and stops any dodgy sales men giving it to someone else.I've just been told week 34 for mine (w/c 21st Aug). That's about 6 weeks later than I expected.
"Hi everyone,I have a 2018 Q5 S line TDI. Had the brake pad warning light pop up on the dash about 1 week ago. I took it into my local Kwik Fit as they were doing a free brake check to find out the cause, if it was the fronts or rears affected. Ended up having the front pads & rears done along with rear discs. Went to collect the car and was advised they couldn’t get the warning light to go off!! So no further forward now, and very annoying!! P.S Audi wanted £1400 to carry out the same work!!!!Anyone have any ideas on what the problem may be at all please? Or are able to point me in the right direction?Thanks in advanceSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Welcome to our forumIt will need new pad sensors which ought to have been replaced with pads.Audi may be expensive, but you get what you pay for. My dealer is reliable and price matches quotes from a.n.other garagesI was very disappointed when I last used a back street garage."
"Sounds like they didn't replace the 'brake pad sensors' which would only be on the front brake pads, that or they didn't plug them back inAlso I wouldneverget my brakes changed at Kwik Fit! I would rather get them done myself, a trusted independent or Audi."
"Thanks for the replies. After being online, I now have it in my head that could it maybe just of been a faulty sensor loom/ harness issue and no need for brake pads being replaced??Anyway car’s now booked into a local reputable Indy next Friday who specialises in anything VAG to diagnose the problem, so we’ll see what they say!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Did you get a look at the old pads and disks. To be fair to KF, Audi sensor comes on way before pads are done and there is zero wear tolerance on disks"
"No I didn’t! They said the rears were worse than the fronts, and that the back disks had a ‘lip’ in them so they would need changed too. Front pads were getting there and not a must, but I just decided to have them done at the same time. 2 x fronts 2x rears and 2 x rear disks for £716 which I thought was reasonable.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Halfords are doing""Brakes for Life""(includes pads & labour), so I had my rear pads replaced [Pagid supplied] this week for £142 - I'll never have to pay anything to have new rear brake pads again until the day I die, or hang up my keys, whichever comes first.I'll get the front brakes done on this scheme eventually."
I wasn't aware of this. I keep my car's a long time so this will be great
I think the trick is to get the pads done before your discs are worn - they won't fit the free pads to any discs that are below the recommended limit for your car.You still have to pay for the sensor (about a tenner) but the pads and labour for fitting them is free for life (regardless of how many different variants of cars you ever own) - all you must do is remember to transfer the policy to your new car within 30 days of taking ownership.
Has anyone had issues with LTE and connecting to MMI on their Q5?I’ve got a 2022 Q5 which I just purchased and the system doesn’t seem to be able to connect online. No live traffic on maps for example and I can’t connect it to MyAudi app. I can’t log into the MMI with the MyAudi details even though it’s correct. Just says try again later. I’ve notice that there is no signal on the LTE signal strength.
I didn’t have the new car yet but in other forums I read that Audi servers often have problems….
It’s nothing to do with the servers. There’s just no LTE connection ever so it can’t connect to data.
Was it working before purchase?Might be the aerial in the roof? I have heard water can leak into the roof fitting.
"I think I read somewhere some people had sim problems and had to use another, or reconfigure it."
No never worked since I purchased the car. I’ll ask the dealer about that.
"I’ll ask my dealer about this as well. I’ve read elsewhere that sometime the LTE module needs replacing as well,"
If it’s an issue with signing in/registering for MyAudi on the MMI you can email for support here:digitalsupport.uk@audi.deDescribe the issue and they will get back to you. They resolved the set up issue I had.
"Thanks for this.Just got back from dealer and they did a 3 hour software update that has the LTE working now. I can log in with Myaudi account. However, none of the online services are working. They said it can take up to 2 weeks for it to kick in and there’s an outage with Audi today as well.I’ll give it 2 weeks and see what happens. It maybe I need to email to the above which is helpful."
The online services kicked in within 72 hours of the software update. I can’t get it connected to the myaudi app. But less bothered by that. At least the car is online now.
Got home yesterday 12 miles driven when home stopped engine the fans where on and a oil burning smell Audi SQ5 1015 any idea why never done it b4
2015 yeat
Welcome to our forumRegen smell ?
Pretty certain it’s regen smell
"Welcome. Usual cause of smell of oil is either an engine vent (oil filler cap, dipstick tube, breather/recirculation hose) open, or you may a leak from a gasket."
Where do you normally fill up?
"Hi Everyone, am looking for 19 inch winter wheels and tires for my 2023 Q5. I am finding a lot of sets that fit 2018 or 2019 Q5's - my question is are 2017 thru 2019 wheels useable/interchangeable with my 2023 model?Thanks for your help!"
Welcome to our forum
"Hi all!First post!I ordered a new 2021 Q5 on mid June 2021, and I'm still wating for the car. I just contacted my dealer here in Spain and the salesman said to me that on 10 November the car left San Jose to Veracruz. I think it should be already in Veracruz... Good progress had been made because it should have left San Jose on 25 November not 10 November according to the initial planning.That said. According to the sales man, it seems there is a bottleneck in Veracruz, and they are experiencing delays. They can not ensure that the car will get Spain before the end of the year. It sounds crazy to me! As far as I know the car will go to Emden first, and then Spain but not sure...Anyone else waiting?Best regardsAlberto"
"I am waiting for my new Q5. I ordered it about a month ago with a 5 to 6 month lead time. I spoke to Audi and they have component shortages and, ironically, demand is currently exceeding supply. If you wanted to order a Vorsprung Q5 with a sunroof then they won't even give you a build date."
"Hi, Welcome to our forum.Where in Spain are you?"
"Oh I see! I ordered it mine on June, but soon I forgot everything and was not thinking about it for many many months. However, as time goes by I'm getting restlessHope I get the car previous to Christmas vacation. Let's see hehe....what I'm not sure it is about the route from Mexico to Europe. It seems the route is San José -> Veracruz -> Emden....but not sure."
hi! thank you! I work in Madrid but I live in a small city around 150km from there. Remote work and somedays I travel to Madrid
"This doesn't surprise me. Until the ship or train is full or almost full then nothing moves. Bearing in mind that Madrid is roughly in the centre of Spain then I would assume that they will use rail. However, it will not go directly from Emden to Madrid, as it will stop at other centres. The train will deliver to a distribution centre so your Q5 will not move again until the car transporter is full. Once the Q5 gets to the dealer then a PDI is performed which takes a maximum of a day. If they use a ship then the process is more complicated and it would add up to a week to the transportation."
"Yes, I understand. The salesman does not have more information. From what I have investigated, the car comes in a ship to Santander (Spain), and then a train to Madrid. But I'm not completely sure about this... I will tell you when I have the car"
"I ordered my Q5 55 TFSI e mid October and I have just had a confirmed build week of 10, 2022. My dealer informed me that I should get it by the end of April/beginning of May."
"Great! Like me, more or less 6-7 months. I ordered mine mid June and if nothing happens, I will have it during the first 2 weeks of January. Till October, I did not think a lot about it, but the last 2 months are being complicated 😅"
"I'm still waiting for the car. It had to be at the dealership on Wednesday, but it was not. This is being frustrating. I claimed to the salesman that if I do not have the car in January, I will look for other options outside of Audi. I've been waiting 7 months, they told me the car was in Emden on 4 December and one month a half later they do not know where the car is. Surrealist!"
"New memberOrdered new 45tfsi edition 1 in august 2021 with a lead time of 20 to 24 weeks been told build week 8 expect it in June 2022, the wait is difficult to say the least🤣"
"Welcome@Sim! Yes, definetely the wait is a painIn my case, I'm still waiting.....At least, the car is already in the storage park in Madrid. It has been there for a week and now I'm waiting it gets to the car delarship. It is being a nighmare. I think my case it is not normal. The car left factory on 8 November, and it seems there is something they do not tell me because 3 months delivery from factory....it is crazy!Good luck with the process. I'm sure it will not be like mine"
It is not unusual for a car to be damaged in transit. I would examine the car very carefully before accepting it.
"Yes, I know. I just got a message from the salesman that they will give the car next Tuesday !!!🙌🙌"
Check the paintwork in different light conditions. If they have had to respray a panel certain colours can be difficult to match or blend in.
"I got the car yesterday. It is in perfect state. Thank you so much for the comments and helping me through the whole process. When I see the date I opened this thread, I think how naive I was thinking about getting the car before Christmas vacacion 😅"
A happy ending
That's great news. Worth the wait. Now you can have fun.

"Update on my car , build week 8 got told it was in transit , ordered 28th aug 2021"
"SQ5_NW said:That seems a ridiculously long wait.I ordered my SQ5 in July 2021 and have been advised that it's left the factory. It has to go to Emden (from Mexico) before being shipped to the UK. Expecting car to arrive at dealers towards end of April, so for me delivery has been roughly 9 months.Maybe the hybrids require even more semi conductors than ICE cars and shortages are causing further delays?Also, I believe wiring looms come (came) from Ukrainian suppliers and that VAG, and probably plenty of other manufacturers, are having to re-source items from other suppliers which may also be adding to the delay.Click to expand...In any case, albeit the global issues still very long wait as I was able to order it before the order ""rush"".Apparently, some of the delivery issues could be related to restrictive options such as a panoramic roof and tow bar. that I got removed from my order in September."
"That's good news, are UK destined cars also built in Mexico?"
"Yes, U.K. Q5s are also built in Mexico and shipped via Germany to the U.K."
"Just had notification that my car has arrived in the UK and is on the way to the dealers, so journey from Veracruz to Emden was possibly quicker than expected. Not heard yet from dealer, but might get it before Easter."
That’s good news. How long was it from build to arrival in U.K.?
"The information I received from Audi / dealer wasn't as comprehensive as others seemed to have, but I received an email from Audi on the 22nd March to say that it had finished final inspection. I think it takes a week from start of build to reach that stage, so in answer to your question I would estimate roughly 3½ weeks (15.03.22 to 07.04.22 = 23 days).Dealer informs me that they usually receive cars 10 to 14 working days after they land in the UK, so after Easter looks more likely now for me.On further investigation it looks like the vessel (City of St Petersburg) arrived at Tyne yesterday (6th) at 17.40."
Thanks for that. 👍
"Latest update and car is due at dealers within the next 36 hours, so probably Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.That makes it about 6 working days from arriving in the UK.Car won't get prepared over the Easter weekend, so have provisionally agreed to 10.00 am on Wednesday next week for handover (it's going to be a v e r y long weekend for me 🙄)."
That was quick!!!!
"I ordered my new Q5 55 tfsi e Competition in October 2021. Fairly quickly I was given a tentative build date of week 2 2022. A few weeks after I was given a confirmed build date of week 12 2022, 21st of March. As of today, 13th of April, the car has not been built and no one can tell me exactly why. So, patience is a virtue. Fortunately Wakefield Audi are being brilliant about the whole process."
"Hi mate, these dates are exactly the same as mine except I ordered in August. Have you had any updates since? Audi Coulsdon are saying it's still showing as build week 12 but they have no idea if it's been built or not."
"The only update I have had is that it could still be in production and/or could be waiting for a component. All I do know is that it is not on a ship. The status code is somewhat granular. Status 20 means that the components are allocated, the car could have been built or the car could be ready to go to the dock. The next status is 30 which is that it is at the dock."
Apparently I’m at status 30 which I thought meant gathering parts prior to being built? The status seem to have changed since I ordered my current s4 in 2018. Would be great if it meant at dock though.
*Statuses
Did you get it OK? How you enjoying it?
You should be able to disconnect the speakers?
"SQ5_NW said:Yes, had it just over two months now and generally liking it very much, particularly the refinement, seat comfort and the mid range 'shove'.My only (minor) gripes are:The initial step off the line feels a bit tardy when not in Sport mode (where's the 700Nm of torque?).Would be nice if the centre screen could be moved to make it within arms reach.The artificial exhaust sound verges on the irritating (I have it set to it's quietest setting but wish it cold be switched off - we also have an A6 V6 TDi and it is sounds just fine as it is)Wished Audi would have allowed air suspension to be ordered on standard SQ5.Fuel consumption is averaging around 35mpg but is a lot better on longer runs (42 - 45 mpg is quite easy), but around town it's nearer mid 20's. Not sure what it'll be when we start towing the horse trailer.One other thing that I've found a bit odd is the number of re-gen cycles it has done (probably 4 or 5 in the first 1800 miles). On one particular occasion it did one the day after it had had a 150 mile motorway trip - so not much logic in that.Click to expand...Thanks for the update. Sounds like a great car (no pun intended regarding the exhaust sounds!).So overall, what was your flash to bang time - from ordering to delivery?"

Ordered late July 2021 and took delivery late April this year (but there was some discussion on cost that delayed delivery by about a week or so).
I ordered my Q5 55 tfsi e late October 2021 and it is currently on a ship so I should be picking it up mid August 2022.
"Hello All - my first post !I ordered my new 55 TFSIe Competition in December 2021 for delivery on 1st September 2022, thinking I was giving them plenty of time.The salesman said, ""hmmm, yes we MIGHT be able to get you one by then"".Just been told last week, the car is made and on a boat from Mexico and could take another 6 weeks.No discussion on price, but I assume they will be keeping to the figure we agreed in December...?"
I was/am in the same situation as you. I ordered my Q5 55 in October 2021. The car was delivered to my dealer yesterday and I have arranged to collect it next Thursday. The price and configuration has not changed and my PCP repayments are the same as quoted originally. The 6 weeks is correct as it is shipped to Emden in Northern Germany then from there to the North of England then the South.
"Yes, sounds about right.This is the first time I have ever ordered a brand spanking new car to be made just for me, so it is all a bit weird"
I have had Audi's for just over 40 years and weird only begins to describe the current supply situation.
"I also have had many many Audi's over my long years, but always ordered s/h, low mileage, ex-demos, off the shelf, so I am used to:""I'll have that one please"" "" Certainly sir, when would you like to collect it?"" type conversations...Weird probably describes the whole world we are living in at the moment."
Just been to see my Q5 55 tfsi e to check it over. The only item missing was the wireless charging mat. Who cares as where the mat should be there is a USB-C socket.
I ordered a Q5 50 TFSI e in Jan 2022. I was told delivery would be Aug 2022. I was then told in May 2022 that the build had been pushed back to March 2023. I checked in Jan 2023 and was told it had a week 4 build. I'm now being told that it's still not been allocated a build week. Am I having my pants pulled down by the broker?
Lead times can be very model and option specific. You could always wander into a dealer and ask them to check the lead time on their system. You should have a build number so that will be easily checked. If you haven't then the broker may be playing games. Aren't you now dealing direct with the dealer that the broker aligned you with?
Welcome to our forumSounds like you are being told porkies. Which broker? Name and shame
I received last August my Q5 55 tfsi e which was purchased from a franchised dealer. From order to delivery it took 10 months. My dealer gave me the Audi order number very early on in the process and kept me up to date with the manufacturing stage code. You are being told porkies. Get the Audi order number then get an franchised dealer to give you an update. The broker will have ordered from a dealer. Get the broker to tell you the dealer name then contact them with the Audi order number and then complain about the broker using any combination of four letter words you desire.
"Congrats on your new ride, man! It's always exciting to hear about people getting new wheels. But damn, it sounds like the delivery process is a real pain in the butt. By the way, I'm also on the hunt for a new ride myself. I'm thinking of shipping a car from the dealership, and I stumbled upon some info onshipping a car cost. Have you ever shipped a car before? How much did it cost you? I'd love to hear your feedback on this. Anyway, this forum looks good, and I'm glad to be here. It's my first time here, and I'm really digging the vibe. So, what's up with you guys? What are you all driving these days?"
"ScottyUK said:Time for me to start from scratch. '23 spec car is about 3 weeks from delivery and I've just cancelled and gone with a loaded '23.5 spec car.

I.e. the roof fixing points get removed. The German site warns of this but since Audi UK didn't list the fixing points they've also bot mentioned the removal of them.

You’ve certainly put an awful lot of thought into that and it sounds like you know exactly what you want.I thought the s line came with 40/20/40 rear seats or are you talking specifically about MY23.5 or the sport back?
With the ones you’ve seen is it just a 60:40 split rather than ones that don’t go down at all?

Hey all. New to the forum.Looking to purchase a 71 plate Q5 45 tfsi sportback.Does this model have wireless android auto. Also noticed it doesn't have a tray underneath the arm rest. Plus no cup holders in the rear armrest. Is this a spec thing or a reduced chip shortage thing. Thank in advance.
Welcome to our forum
"Hi I have a 22 plate S line- no cup holders in rear armrest not tray under front centre- disappointing - I also have a few items missing/not working ""due to chip shortage"".As far as I know Wireless works with Android- sorry I am an Apple person."
Rear cupholders come with the storage pack.I believe wireless Android is standard from the face-lift but not 100%
Thank you
"So I joined the forum as soon as I bought my q5, for first I bought it from a island lose to the island I live in (Tenerife/gran Canaria) as soon as I got it the engine light was on, but I had already booked the boat bk. So when I got home, I text the guy who bought the car from (bear in mind it’s from a offical Audi VW dealership) and he said take it to your local Audi I’ll contact with them and resolve the problem. Great! I’ll pick the car up on the Friday on the Monday went into the garage as it was closed over the weekend. They have the card ever since, waiting for parts to arrive to resolve the issue. I bought this car at the start of the month and had it for a weekend.So I emailed the local garage to find out what was going on and he sent me this and this is what I wanna know from you guys what do you think about this reply?Yes, we are waiting to receive the spare parts to replace the system filterrecirculating exhaust.The expected arrival of the spare parts is for the end of this week."
Hope that cures your issue at no cost to you
Just wondering if any of you guys know what up mis it a big problem should I just asked for a full refund or wait it out as it’s a car that I want to for a whileits covered by garentee since I just bought it. just hope its not a seriois problem
"Clogged up EGR and DPF is a common issue for diesel cars which are only driven short journeys. I would suggest this is almost certainly the issue for a car driven only in the Canary Islands.I guess this is translation from Spanish? Hopefully it is the repair as recommended by Audi, i.e. to replace EGR and DPF. This is a very expensive repair and should make your Q5 good as new."
"Well I had strong words in a very polite way, no courtesy car was issued a whole time which will be nearly 25 days. So I applied them. The option is to give me an extra one year guarantee on top of the one year existing with the purchase and they agreed. Can’t wait to get it back now"
"You get Audi connect free for first year. IMHO, it is not worth £141."
Cheers Missile -so I won’t get it on my approved used and would have to buy it upfront?Grateful to know what I would miss out on if I don’t have it as need to discuss with dealer on collection. Thanks.
There is a full breakdown of the features onAudi.co.uk
"I don't have virtual cockpit, so cannot advise. I can confirm Audi maps do continue to work, but obviously without live updates.You might want to suck it and see. You can always add connect later. In the overall scheme, £141 is not a lot of money."
Understood but thanks anyway. It helps to be inquisitive and informed before engaging with dealer handover. It seems odd to earmark a big slug of money for a car ..then be looking at best petrol prices on a car display etc knowing that with my annual mileage it won’t make much difference. I am moving from diesel to petrol and I doubt if it will cost more than an additional £100 per annum. Car insurance is going to drop a few pounds which surprised me. The only ouch was moving from £135 to £521 car tax…but as you say in the overall scheme of things…
"Although Audi Connect was not discussed by the dealership throughout my approved used purchasing process, I put a call in last night to the MyAudi 24 /7 support line 08002792884.This was transferred to an agent in Greece who very quickly asked for the Vin number.Within a minute he confirmed my vehicle will have 18 mths subcription left on Audi connect (exp 5/24). My understanding is that all recent UK cars will have 3 years Audi connect subscription from new , but that is not necessarily the case everywhere ,so it’s down to what was specced originally/previously as to what licence period remains when buying used."
As missile said you won’t loose maps on either display. However you can use your phone to display Google maps or waze which will always update
Thanks Airhog-got some time to see whether or not its beneficial to renew.
Does Waze display on the Virtual Cockpit on newer Q5's?On my MY2019 model when I fire up Waze - the Virtual Cockpit Mapping is replaced by a very bland compass.
No Waze does not show on Virtual cockpit(unless I am not using correctly) just on Info screen
I have an Audi Q5 s line 2014 which I purchased in February it’s last service and oil change was in October 2022 at 69220 miles.I have just been away for Easter and done a 300 mile round trip with no problems then this morning my oil light came on saying low oil please top up with 1 litre I find this strange as my service isn’t due as my current mileage is 72000.As this is my first Q5 is this normal? Do they drink oil as well as fuel?Any help would be appreciated.Thankscraig
"Craig, do you have the diesel or petrol? petrol 2.0 are known to drink oil but not the diesel .. or it could be a faulty oil level sensor."
"Sorry pal it’s a diesel, not sure it’s the sensor as the oil level was just above the minimum line before I went away."
"Hi I bought new Q5 4.00TDI last August- now done 8k miles and have had to add 1litre of oil twice since delivery- Never ever seen this in 30+ years of BMW/Mercedes/LandRover ownership.Dealer tells me ""its normal""Not impressed."
"Right gotchaRight gotcha, you definitely shouldn’t be at minimum if you’ve only done just under 3k since the last service, i haven’t had to top up between services and i did 15k in my first year of ownership."
"That definitely doesn’t sound “normal”, a quick google search shows other people with similar experience as you though, I find it very surprising that they would make a contemporary engine this way."
My experience is that my car will use approx half a litre over 2 or 3 k miles. All engines will burn some oil.So depending on fill level at service I sometimes have to top up. Nothing to worry about.
I spoke with Audi today who confirmed the car will burn oil just like you’ve said so if it asks for a top up then just put a litre in. I’ve done this and the level is now showing full. They said it’s perfectly normal. Thanks for the replies everyone 👍🏼
I guess thats 3.0 life then
No mines 2 litre TDI 😳
"Its not ""perfectly normal"" in a BMW, Mercedes or LandRover - first and definitely my last Audi"
"In that case, see how you get on now you’ve topped up. If you have to top up again in 2-3K i’d be surprised as we have the same engine and i didn't have to top up between my service and i was driving nearly 1K miles a month before my service was due."
Well I drive all over the country (not in my Audi) but my works van and see more Merc’s broke down than anything and my mechanic did warn me about the engines in them…Hate LandRover’s and BMW’s. So I’ll stick to Audi me thinks. 👍🏼
"Mine is just short of 100k miles. So I can accept a little usage. The first owner may not have been fastidious with early oil changes....If you've owned from new, ran in properly and serviced correctly oil usage would probably be very low."
Depending on how considerate you have been during the running in period then 0.5L oil can be used during the first 10k miles. How the car is driven over the first 10k miles dictates the oil usage over the life of the engine. All engines use oil during this period to a greater or lesser extent so you should not be concerned.
"Hi, after 2 of my mates having had their ""keyless"" cars nicked from their drive by thieves cloning the signal, can anyone suggest a way of isolating my Q5 so that it won't start (switch?) but still leave the alarm / immobiliser active? I've thought about a switch to cut off the fuel pump, but don't know if there is anything easier / more effective? Any ideas?"
I chose not to have keyless.Ghost immobiliserseems to be effective
You can switch off keyless entry in the MMI.
"apparently a dealer told me it doesn’t stop the car transmitting the signals or something like that so they can still clone the key. What it does is stops the key you are using. Not sure if he’s correct or not.Also, I’m looking at a new Q5 to replace my 18 model but a bit worried about the comfort access stuff on the cars. Anyone know if fobs are motion activated now and go to sleep?"
"I wouldn't assume that a dealer knows what they are talking about!If Keyless entry has been switched off, then the cars door sensors won't operate with any nearby signal.How does Audi Advanced Key Work?The Audi Advanced Key works by communicating with proximity sensors in each car door and trunk lid. These sensors are matched to a radio pulse generator in the key that activates when you are within approximately five feet of your vehicle. As soon as you begin to use a door handle or your trunk, your Audi will automatically unlock."

Convenience Key does seem to be a solution looking for a problem.I have never though that pressing a button on the key to open the car was one of life's unnecessary burdens.
Very true. I see you have the C&S pack on your ride. Have you disabled the key?Also I’m looking at ultra blue as a colour. How have you found it so far?
Depends on your use. Many find it useful when hands are fully going to or leaving the car to just do the foot wave.I'm sure it doesn't make sense for everyone.Audi have been slow with UWB adoption. I guess they just wait until a totally new gen for each vehicle. That would really help.

"I have the Beam's rings in the back doors and ebay 'SQ5' one's in the front doors and I have the C&S pack, so rear door install isn't a problem.I changed them over very early in my ownership, so can't recollect what the difference was like, but the genuine Audi one's seem bright enough to provide reasonable illumination of the ground beneath the door.The cheaper ebay one's are less bright and therefore less effective."
"Hi, I have a 2019 Q5. I have had notification there is a fault with the right/left brake lights. The main centre light works but both tail gate light clusters are not working (including the indicators and night lights). The bumper lights are working ok. Having looked in the owners manual it does not discuss how to replace the tail gate light cluster bulbs. I appreciate there might be something else wrong as both clusters aren't working but just wondered if anyone had experienced a similar problem and how it was resolved. Thanks."
Welcome to our forumSeems too much of a coincidence for brake light side and indicator bulbs to fail at the same time. I would guess you have a wiring issue. Possibly a bad earth?Check You tube for videos on how to remove rear light clusters.
"The standard Q5 has a rougher ride than similar vehicles. It could be an expensive mistake. You will always wonder if you ordered the wrong spec. Well worth traveling to another dealer to check out which option suits your needs and pocket.A ""good"" dealer would arrange this for you."
"I always believe in keeping it simple. My Q5 has standard suspension with 20"" wheels and 45 profile tyres from Pirelli. This is comfortable and rides well. You have to bear in mind that a Q5 can weigh up to 2500kg and I for one would not throw it around."
In the UK there was only about 6 options and air is only if you get the Vorsprung fully loaded model*. Air isn't an option on other q5's. Germany seems to pick and choose but we're really limited. Slightly off topic but I'm pissed on this subject : I couldn't get read side airbags or side warning. Two safety features that are simply not available on any Q5 Sportback currently.If you go Vorsprung then you're forced to have it blacked out etc. We can't pick and choose
"I am slightly confused, on my 2023 model year Q5 I have 255/45R20 standard Pirellis. I have standard suspension and I would consider the ride quality to be good. If you want some really good tyres, on my last Q3 I had Hankook summer tyres and they worked in all conditions and the ride quality was superb."
Ride quality is subjective.
Which Hankook tyres?
They were Hankook Ventus 255/40R20 summer tyres. They were fitted as standard on new Q3's by Audi.
I went to the Dealer to have this loaded into the MMI and was told that it could only be done at the time of initial sale. So I'm out of luck. Does that jive with experience/knowledge you may have had?

"missile said:You have a short memoryDiesel was promoted as a more environmentally friendly fuelas part of the EU’s response to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO₂). Diesel engines are “lean-burn”, meaning they use less fuel and more air to get the same performance as a petrol engine.+++According to modern science, using diesel fuelreduces the harmful CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming. Diesel engines are more efficient than gas engines. So even though diesel contains more carbon than gas, efficient diesel engines emit less of it into the air.Click to expand...Where in any of the quote does it say its good for the environment? No ICE car is although politicians have claimed some are better/worse than others. I stand by my original post 😉"
It could be argued no vehicles ICE or Electric are good for the environment There is even pollution apparently caused by tyre particles when driven. We are also yet to see mountains of exhausted batteries accumulating and the environmental consequences of this. Yes some precious metals will be recycled. Millions of perfectly good EV’s will eventually be written off prematurely due to the end of the life of the battery and the lack of cost effectiveness of fitting new batteries. great!
"Seems you have difficulty reading / comprehending>""reduces the harmful CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming"""
"'Reduces' compared to worse polluting engines. That doesn't mean its good for nature. Not as terrible, yes, but def not beneficial to nature."
"You seem to have forgotten, this is what you actually said >>We were told reducing by green house gas emissions diesel was good for the environment.Admit it, you were wrong"
Better than other alternatives. No vehicle is good for the environment. Did anyone really think driving a diesel was beneficial to nature? Come on 😁

I guess you don't want to buy a replacement grill? If you can find a broken one at a breakers yard you might be able to salvage the missing piece.
Also check eBay for a used cheap replacement.

Does your car has the option to connect telephone in MMI?What phone do you have? Not all phones are compatible.
"With your phone connected via Bluetooth to you car (and the phone settings checked to output via Bluetooth when connected) it should work when you play music on your phone.It does on mine, mmi 3g high.Just checked my settings on android phone. Go to Bluetooth connections, select connection to vehicle, then settings within connection, make sure audi/media box is enabled."
"Your Q5 needs to have been speced with Bluetooth and AMI (Audi Music Interface). If so just enable it in the MMI setting and connect your phone via Bluetooth. See video below. Connect your phone, then just be press the Media button in the centre console and play music on Spotify etc"

"Looking at all the examples on ebay they look like they have locating lugs at the foglight end, so uou would need to prise off from the other end. It should just be clipped in place...Unless someone has had them off before perhaps snapped the clips and decided to use glue...."
"Thanks for your reply Richard, that’s my worry. I think if I pull them any harder they will snap and on most YouTube videos for this model they simply just pull off. I’ll have another go tomorrow so wish me luck. 🤞🏼👍🏼"
Fingers crossed for you.
"Easy to do (did it the other week to install even brighter LED fogs than I had before), just watch some YouTube videos to see where all the tabs are. Use a plastic pry tool and pull from the number plate side, as there are plastic fingers on the wheel side."
I’ve watched every YouTube video their is and no way does it pull out as easy as that video. So the pry tool will be my next attempt. Thanks for your reply. 👍🏼
Well its easy with a 'plastic' pry tool to loosen some of the plastic catches as you pull. Use the video to know where they are located. You can also access from behind by folding back part of the wheel arch lining. I have done both methods in the past. Both easy
"I have a 2013, I removed a mine a few months ago to fit leds and mine were tough to get off. I snapped the inner lug (opposite end to the lamp) on both but still fit back snug. I followed the same vid above just use a pry tool and give them a good pull!"

"Update: checked for codes… none. It’s running clean. However, I did find a front tire running low that may have been a factor in this, with one wheel revolution out of synch with the others. Monitoring…..Hi, new guy here. I did some searching but did not see anything like this issue I've had maybe 4 times in as many months. 2015 Q5 TDI with 112k km, fully serviced, no other issues. A few minutes after getting on the highway a low rumble type noise started getting progressively louder. Could not discern where it's coming from, but it was getting louder and louder even as I slowed to a stop. Nothing obvious as I did a once around the vehicle. Got back in, and it was gone. The next 3 times it occurred, same thing.... it began at 115-120kph after being on the road for 5-10 minutes, got louder and louder even as I got off the highway, and then after the vehicle was stopped and then started moving again, its gone, for another month. I haven't checked for codes. My gut tells me maybe it's got something to do with at AWD getting out of synch or a sensor giving false info, but that's just a guess. Has anyone encountered anything like this before?"
Welcome to our forumWheel bearing?
"Welcome. I have not heard of that problem before. Are all tyres inflated to the correct pressure? When you stop try to check the wheel temperatures, if one is hotter it could be a bearing or brake problem (dragging caliper). Failing that check for fault codes."
"Thx. I will toss a digital thermometer in the car to check trmps next time it occurs, but having dealt with dragging calipers and bad bearings on other vehicles over the years I don't think this is it. The symptom literally disappears as soon as the car is stopped and then begins moving again, and it sounds like you are driving right beside a rumbling train - low frequency rumble throughout the vehicle. I've tried recording it but probably need to hear it on a home stereo because a phone can't reproduce sound that low properly."
"Don't think so.... it completely disappears as soon as you stop and then start driving again, and may not return for a month. Also, it's not affected by steering left or right while the noise is occurring."
Mine did the same 2022 s line..engine felt like it was lugging ....at 17000km the engine went boom....rod bearing recall...now waiting for parts...😎

I have a 2014 q5 2.0 tdiI have developed an annoying squeaking noise which I think is in the rear passenger sideI have had all the seats out and back in and it’s still the sameWondering if it could be the suspension?Maybe need new springs?Any advice would be greatly appreciatedThank youPeter
"I’d try some silicon spray lubricant around the door, window and tailgate seals and hinges first, then look deeper if no joy."
Drive the car with a passenger in the rear passenger side actively listening and searching for the noise source with their ears! Or ask someone to drive and you listen in the back. This will help locate where the squeak is coming from so you can deal with the real cause of the issue. Andy's suggestion above is also god advice. Hope you find it - squeaks are annoying!
"I have an annoying like plastic rattle on my Q5 at low speed but just can’t figure out where it’s coming from, it sounds like a ball in a plastic beaker type noise. Has anyone else had these issues. Any help or advice is much appreciated. 👍🏼"

"Welcome to our forumIt is an interference engine. If timing chain breaks or (more likely) tensioner fails your engine will be destroyed. At 128,000 I would change it.IMHO> Changing oil at 5,000 on a high mileage engine is a waste of money."
Are UK Q5's coming with MHEV technology? I.e. not the 50 and 55 plugin's but the other engines.There seems to be nothing about the Q5 in Audi UK's site and very little about the mild hybrid tech in general.Does anyone know? Do you ever get 'Coasting' on your dash?
"Yes they are. My Q5 is a MHEV - 2 litre TFSI with a smallish auxiliary battery under the boot floor that is charged on the over-run and when braking. It gives averybrief boost when accelerating and helps with powering electrical ancillaries during the auto stop/start process. As I understand it also helps to smooth restarts too. I see coasting on the dash, usually at higher speeds when easing off the accelerator.I believe most ICE Audis are now MHEV engines. Our other car is a 21 reg Q3 1.5 TFSI and it too is a similar MHEV set up."
Many thanks. It looks like a very sensible solution so I was expecting a wide deployment but there's nothing about it on the website so I was wondering if Audi UK decided not to include it.Thanks for that 👍
"Yes, same on 2022 SQ5"
"I just had my Volvo XC60 AWD totalled by an impaired driver in Florida. There are no AWD Volvos here for replacement. Question: Is the ""excessive oil consumption"" issue a legitimate reason to avoid a 2012 to 2015 Audi Q5? Thank you in advance."
Every car has an issue or two. Consumption should have been rectified
First ( and last Audi) I have owned - Q5 TDI 2023- had to top up oil twice now and only down 5800 miles.First car in last 10 car's over 20 years I have had to add oil between services
"Tdi using oil? It was only the petrol model that had that problem. Yours may be one subject to the recall. (Metal fragments in the oil filter). Even so, get it checked."
"Really, have had 3 Q5 tdi’s never had excessive oil issues what so ever"
I have had Audi's of all flavours for over 40 years. I have always had to put between 0.5L and 0.75L engine oil in the first 1000 miles. After then no extra oil was required between services. This does assume that you run in the new car correctly.
Yes! It is legitimate! I have a 2016 Q5 2.0T and we are now 10k in on repairs an d still not fixed!
"Then I would be unhappy and looking for a garage that could fix the problem. A top end rebuild, valve guides, stem seals, rebore, new pistons and rings should cure. That is unless it is something really simple like excess crankcase pressure cause by crankcase pressure breather system being blocked."
"I own a 2021 Audi Q5. When the outside temperature is below -10 degC (14 degF) the information cluster does not turn on. The information cluster is the screen behind the steering wheel containing speedometer, tachometer, and other vehicle information. The Q5 does start but I must let it idle for about 24 minutes before the information cluster turns on. The time varies with out side temperature. When I park the Q5 indoors there is no problem at all.Has anyone else experienced this?"
"Welcome to our forumBoy, that is cold."
Welcome. When you get in the car and turn the ignition on do you see the basic initialisation in the cluster?
"This sounds very strange, we have temperatures down to around -20 Celsius and I’ve never had any problems with the electronics in mine.If you still have the warranty then I’d definitely recommend taking it to an Audi dealer."
Does the mmi turn on? Low battery on start can delay functions starting on start up.
"I had a similar problem with my A6 display, eventually found to be a connection on the circuit board which opened up when the temperature dropped below around +2C."
What’s the recommendation for rear brake pads for 2015 sq5Thanks
I think you are correct(?)
If the 'baddies' want to get in would you rather they open another door or go via you? I think the risk you suggest is remote unless you have evidence to refute.
I agree it's small. It did give my wife some confidence many years ago when she worked and it was a dark car park. I'm not questioning the reason for it or the risk element. I'm trying to understand Audi as the Germanic approach is normally based on logic.
"I have the flat bottomed wheel and really like the feel and look of it. As the car was already built when I bought it I didn’t get the chance to specify. The only negative is that you can’t get it heated (I live in Sweden) and when it’s -15 it’s very nice to have it warm. If I had to choose on a new build and wasn’t living in such a cold country, then I’d choose the flat bottomed one, it’s all about taste and needs I suppose."
"Hi Jeremy_SWE I have been to Sweden numerous times in winter and know how cold it can get and appreciate the benefit a heated steering wheel would be.I went back into the UK ""build your Audi"" configurator for the Q5 and found that the round steering wheel of the most expensive (Vorsprung) trim level is actually heated. However, no mention is made of heated steering wheels for the other trim levels."
"Ah then you know the score with winters here then 😉.Fortunately I have an app controlled auxiliary heater and heated seats which is an absolute must IMO, so I could live without the heated wheel. My previous Tiguan had a flat bottomed wheel and heated, so a bit strange Audi couldn’t achieve it…Good luck with your purchase and keep us updated with your progress."
I prefer flat bottomQueen - Fat Bottomed Girls (Official Lyric Video) - YouTube
"Specified flat bottom steering wheel on my factory order, and really like it and would specify it again. But its not essential."
I have a flat bottomed steering wheel on my Q3. It looks far better than the round one and it is easier to get in and out of the car. From my experience I would always have a flat bottomed steering wheel.
Seems if you want(?) all of those options you will not be able to have a flat bottom
"Zig said:In further using the UK ""build your Audi"" configurator for the Q5, I find that if a Trim Level with a flat bottom steering wheel is chosen or a flat bottom steering wheel is selected as an option, then if the Tour Pack is added, then the steering wheel is changed to the round steering wheel.It seems that while the flat bottom steering wheel is “multi-function” the round steering wheel is “multi function plus” i.e. the round steering wheel must have additional functionality built into it.The Tour Pack includes:Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go and Traffic-jam assistPredictive efficiency assistantPre-sense FrontCamera-based traffic sign recognitionCollision avoidance assistantTurn assistActive Lane AssistClick to expand...Doesn’t the “plus” part only refer to the fact that it’s heated? On the FBW the (*) button which would be for heating on the round wheel is used instead to control other functions. Mine is set up to switch between media and radio. Apart from that I’m pretty sure the wheels have the same functionality (?)."
I was looking at ordering a FBSW but due to the above clash with other options it wasn't a choice.I was just on the Audi UK site and now the FBSW has been removed totally regardless of options except for the Edition 1. The options list is getting crazy short now where as onaudi.dethey can have virtually anything they want!
My my 2023 Q5 s line came with FMSW- I like it
"Does anyone know why my b9 Q5 has a very loud and noticeable creaking noise coming from the rear of the vehicle every time I drive over speed bumps and driveways? I took my car to Audi and they said there was nothing wrong with the suspension, not sure if anyone else has experienced this issue, any thoughts?"
Tailgate not latched properly?
Wouldn’t this noise go away after opening and closing the tailgate a few times? This noise has been there since I bought the car 2 months ago used. Is that something that audi can fix for me?
"if It has been checked at a workshop and no obvious issues found, why not try some silicone lubricant spray around the rear suspension joints, springs & dampers - it won’t do any harm but will help if any of the joints have become dry."
If the tailgate is not latching properly it will need adjusting. I would have expected audi to have found the problem if it was the suspension.
Sure it’s not the boot roller blind squeaking where it hooks into the side panel mouldings?
"To check remove blind and everything from bout and test drive. If noise persists test drive with someone in rear, hopefully they will pinpoint last / right"
Good catch but I removed it and it’s still making the same noise when going up angled inclines like driveways
"Ok, it was always worth checking as sometimes the simple answer is the right one. Hope you find a solution."
"Update: noise is coming from the rear hatch passenger side bottom, I just took the vehicle in for service and send them a video of the noise. Note, when the hatch is opened , the creaking goes away completely. Maybe it needs lubrication or adjustment. Will provide updates as audi service tells me more"
"I have a 2015 q5 sline plus,having the same problem,I'm still under Audi warranty they have changed the engine mounting brackets both sides but I still hear the creaking noise, it's going in again for service,I will keep you updated !"
Update: Audi lubricated the rear hatch seal with some grease of some sort? and all noises have subsided. Happy it wasn’t a suspension or sub frame issue.
hmm my issue is from the rear of the vehicle not sure if the engine mounting brackets would affect that area. Audi was able to fix the loud creaking noise by lubricating the rear hatch seal. Good luck with your car! Hopefully it’s not as serious as engine mounts
I'm glad they sorted the problem for you.

Annoying that no option in mmi to manually lower
Not a big issue in the scheme of things. But….The three functions are Wave/Knead/Stretch displayed in that order.Every time I turn on the massage seat function it defaults to the second option “knead”To change to my preferred option “wave” I have to lean across to the MMI screen every time and fiddle about to change the option-which us not ideal whilst driving.Is there any way I can change the default option to Wave? I just can’t see it anywhere. Thanks
I have had my Q5 for about 6 months and I have found no way of setting the default massage type.
Thanks - does yours stay on “knead” they want me to take the car in but won’t tell me the solution.
I suspect you need to use VCDS(?)
Just wondering for those with air suspension for normal drivingDo you :a) Just “set and forget“ in comfort/efficiency/dynamic or auto modes?orb) Adjust the settings regularly to suit the drive?e.g. Motorways/urban roads/town drivingWhat mode and when?Thanks
Don't have it on my SQ5 (sadly) but we have it on our A6 Allroad and it stays in the Auto setting unless we venture off road and need extra ground clearance.
"Thanks for that. I haven’t yet spent enough time trying the different options and need to do so.Initial thoughts are that ‘comfort” is best for local humps and and bumps and perhaps “auto” is a little harsher ride but not as much as “dynamic” I think “efficiency” ( which I have used most of the time recently as all heating options are set to on, it is blinking cold and the Q5 is gulping fuel) is probably closer to auto…but as I say too early days to be conclusive. I am wondering purely out of interest if anyone has switched to the “individual mode” and what and why they have set that up the way they have."
I think Individual mode allows for changes to steering weight and gearbox changes (normal or sport) rather than just the suspension setting.
Thank you. Was just wondering if anyone had experimented with different individual settings and what their experience was.
See my question along similar lines with driving mode. Individual doesn’t help much with customisation from what I can seeVorsprung air suspension questionsHoping you can help. Picked up my car at weekend. Instruction manual not detailed enough on this topic. 1. Dynamic mode lowers ride 15mm. Can I lower car manually on other modes. They seem to go higher not lower.

Welcome to our forumDid you replace DIY?Did you clean all component parts?Usually when EGR is blocked DPF will be blocked too.Could be one of several faults. Suggest you invest in an error code reader.
I think any error codes have to be cleared / reset.
Hican anyone confirm if a standard 21yr model SQ5 has adaptive Suspension? I know the Vorsprung model has.Thanks
"All recent SQ5's have adaptive coil spring suspension, but only the Vorsprung get adaptiveair suspension.Sadly, air is no longer an option so I had to do without as I couldn't justify extra £12/13K over the standard model for the Vorsprung when I ordered mine. Shame, as I would have paid the £2K extra to just add the air."
"Thanks for the info. Can you adjust the suspension on yours to comfort, dynamic etc"
Crazy how some countries can pick and choose components individually. Check outaudi.de. I cant see a chip shortage for them either!! Bitter? Me? Yes!!
"Yes, you get Comfort, Auto, Dynamic and Individual where you can set steering, gearchange, and dampers, etc., to you own setting.Personally, I set it to Individual and set the ride to Comfort on collection and it's stayed that way every since."
I wanted a pano but the only way of getting one was to pay an extra £12k. The UK marketing department are devoid of common sense when setting the configurator options.
Thanks again for all the info - much appreciated.
"That's good to hear. When I was at the dealers I checked a showroom model and there was only two options under Individual, no dampers.I have that choice on my A4 and it's felt like a step back. I know sometimes there's some odd things with Individual. I.e. on the A4 you only got it if you had full optical controllers I.e. you needed B&O plus satnav.My fingers are crossed."
I was looking onaudi.deThey can virtually choose component by component. I didn't see any signs of a chip shortage
Was the showroom model you checked a regular Q5 or a SQ5?
Q5 - is there a difference on suspension and drive select tech?
I have an Audi Q5 TDi 2014 and was wondering if it’s worth doing a stage one re-map to improve fuel consumption as I only do short journeys.Any help is appreciated 👍🏼
"How many miles do you do?If you ONLY do short journeys, I would be more concerned about your DPF."
I only do school runs and general running about really. About 6000 miles a year.
Sellers claim you can improve both mpg and performance. If only 6000miles it would (?) time to recover remap costs. I would save your money for a TerraClean.
Ok thanks pal I’ll have a look into this. 👍🏼
"I have just traded my 59 plate Q5 for a new 2017 one. My 59 ran 18 inch 235/60 Bridgestone Dueller. The new one has 19 inch 235/55 Michelin Latitude Sport. I am very surprised at the much increased tyre noise on the new model, noticeable after immediately swapping cars. It sounds like the brake pads rubbing and initially I also thought it could be a noisy transmission. However it is neither as I ocassionaly hit a smooth patch of quiet road tarmac it almost vanishes. But 90% of the road tarmac is of the noisier type.My question is what type of tyres do any others have on their new 2017 Q5 and do they notice any noise. Its hard to believe that moving from 18 inch to 19 inch would make such a difference or is it Michelin's are noisy.My 8 Year's ownership provided a very reliable car to 80000 miles with a depreciation of only £2.5K per annum."
"Hi melltt-- I also found my tyres were noisy on delivery of my s-line which has the standard 19s. But I found the noise gets lower as the tyres lose the square edges of the tread pattern and become more rounded as the miles increase. I have 1800 mls on the clock and I tend not to notice the issue now. I think the cabin is so quiet that it highlights noises which were classed as 'normal' in other cars. As you say, the noise changes due to changing road surfaces but stick with it, the noise should start to lower as time goes on. Cheers"
Mine noisy too (depending on tarmac). Done 2500 miles and same. On 18 inch. Noticibly noisier than my previous qashqai. Carwow on YouTube talks about this as justanhonestman reported. Not sure if S line is more quieter as rear windows are better insulated.
Are these the Michelin tyres?
Are these the Michelin tyres?
Yes.
"Picked up my new Q5 this week, with Michelin tyres. Bad road noise from the rear, almost a droning sound above 20mph, even on smooth tarmac. It almost seems like a worn bearing noise, but I think it’s the tyres. Will probably go back to the dealer next week and see what they say."
If the sound insulation felt behind the rear panels is fitted as badly as the felt within my two opening fuse holder compartments in the boot when new. It's no wonder noise is intruding into the cabin. I always have my parcel shelf extended which helps muffle any sounds from the rear. Yet another issue letting this car down. I may be looking at fitting my own sound insulation in the boot and sides area. Shouldn't really have to do this though.
Michelin are 2 dB more than other tyres. Previously had desert duellers with minimal tyre noise on qashqai.
"Thanks for the advice, I'm planning to glue the insulation in place today, and will try driving with the parcel shelf extended as you suggest. Not a bad idea to fit extra insulation either."
"Hi Rexus I think also it's a trait of SUV's. With all that open space behind the rear seats, it's gonna amplify and echo any noise produced in that area. I'm now on the lookout for decent sound deadening material. My first experiment will be to fold the rear seats down and cover the whole area with a king size duvet to see how much quieter it becomes. I know- you're probably saying he needs to get out more lol but I like a challenge.Cheers."
"Hi guys- the readings were written in lines for easy comparison , but the posting process seems to have joined lines together. I hope it still makes sense."
14-18db is absolutely humungous. Not sure we have enough duvets though
"There is a site called 'auto-decibel-db' which lists cabin noise levels for a huge range of cars. They have the 2014 Q5 2.0 petrol coming in at 57db's at 55mph and 60db's at 60mph. As the new model has much more road noise than the last one and is built with lighter materials, It would be interesting to see what readings they get testing the new model. Of course, different road surfaces produce different noise levels, but the noise in the new model can be quite -- tiresome. I also have the pano roof which will not help to keep the sound down.Update-- Car and Driver website report a level of 67db's at 70mph with a solid roof during their review of the new Q5."
"Hi Rexus I have the same tyres but on 19s on my TFSI. Until I can get hold of a proper sound measuring device I cannot be sure of true readings. All I know is that the noise is louder than any car I have been in. The cabin is quiet and a conversation can be had with rear passengers without raising your voice. But the constant rushing air type of noise from the tyres seems to overpower the cabin. Is the drivetrain adding to the mix ? Who knows, but we will stick with the tyres for now. Cheers"

"My problem is there is an additional noise, on top of the usual road noise, which sounds a bit like someone blowing across the top of a beer bottle. It appears to be coming from the rear at anything over 20 mph. Went back to the dealer who agrees the noise is there. We then drove another Q5 with the same tyres and the noise was there too. We then drove an SQ5 and no noise. It could be the Michelin tyres that are the cause, and also, maybe the noise is worse with new Michelin tyres. The next thing is to find a Q5 with tyres other than Michelin Lattitude Sport 3, and see what that sounds like. It would be useful to hear from a forum member with tyres other than the Michelins."
"Hi Rexus I have been reading some American sites where they also have been discussing the Q5 tyre/road noise problem. A lot of the owners swear by Goodyear Eagle F1 tyres reporting much lower noise in the car. Apparently most had changed from Continentals to the Eagle F1s. As you say, maybe other forum members who have other makes on their car could share their thoughts."
"HiI have Pirelli scorpion verde 20"" on my 2017 SLINE. Nothing like you mention and the only significant road noise I get is over really old motorway tarmac.ChrisSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"On my loan Q5 there are continentals. Tyre noise is noticeable. We noticed loud tyre noise on my wife's A3 Sportback when it was new, but have got used to it. They are ok Continentals too. Maybe it's just an Audi thing? I'll have some comparison when my Q5 arrives in a couple of weeksSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Hi guys- as most owners of the new Q5 will not have changed tyres yet, it will be interesting to see how different owners and tyre types fair in the future. Yet another issue spoiling the ownership experience for a lot of people."
"Yes, a comparison with your new Q5 will be interesting."
Justanhonestman: Do you know if the American site complaints related to the current Q5 or the previous model. I assume there would be a difference between the two.
"Hi Rexus it was the new Q5 which they were reviewing. Don't ask what the sites were lol but it was a mixture of motoring magazines, independant reviewers and forums etc. But most mentioned the high road/tyre noise. While waiting on my new Q5 being delivered, the dealer gave me an S-line Plus deisel with 1500 miles on it. There was certainly no noise similar to what I am getting now in my new model Q5. I actually thought about making them an offer on the mk1 I drove. I really liked it and it felt a more solid and robust car. But it makes sense to go for the latest model and tech I suppose -- or so I thought lol. Cheers"
"It turns out, that the demonstrator Q5 I drove in June, and which had very little road noise, was fitted with Michelin Lattitude Sport 3 tyres, the same as mine. If my road noise is being caused by tyres, then the only conclusion is that the noise must reduce with mileage. Dealer is still looking for a Q5 with different tyres to compare."
"I changed from Michelin Latitude Sport on 19in rims to Bridgestone Dueller on 20in rims and was pleasantly surprised to notice a reduction in road noiseIMHO, they seem to be equal on grip."
"I get the impression that most alternatives to the Michelins have less road noise, yet the majority of recent Q5s leaving the factory seem to have Michelins fitted."
Guess I lucked out with my Pirelli's ????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Yes, you have managed to escape the Michelins!Are your tyres the Scorpion Verde All Season, or Summer and/or Plus tyres?"
"My 2018 MY came with Continental Conti Sport Contact 5 tyres, size 235/55 R19, which I thought were pretty quiet. I have changed to the all-season Goodyear Vector 4 Seasons gen2, which I think are even quieter, definitely not in the slightest intrusive. Only a subjective opinion though, no decibel data."
I’m going to attempt to bring this thread back from the dead. I just picked up a 2016 q5 s line with 20” wheels. The tires are brand new Bridgestone duelers. I’m going to attempt the same duvet test using a free iPhone decibel app. I don’t have the cargo cover so the test will just be before and after duvet. If it pans out I’m planning to put some sound absorbing foam in the wheel wells and in the spare tire area to help deaden the tire noise. It’s definitely the first because when I’m on smooth asphalt the car is completely silent. Also the sound is coming only from the rear of the car.
I think the car is pretty quiet overall especially on good tarmac. Road noise is the biggest issue on modern cars. Can’t compare it to previous model Q5 but my older Jaguars were extremely quiet compared to the aluminium built ones.
What tyres do you have?
"Rexus said:Justanhonestman - wow, you've certainly got some interesting results.Took my Q5 on a 100 mile run today. I'm trying to accept the road noise as normal, but I can't. It's almost like there is an additional noise, over and above regular tyre noise, that is present at anything over 20 mph. It also appears to be coming from the rear passenger side, but that could of course be deceptive. I can honestly say I've never experienced such noise in any car I've driven, and it certainly wasn't there when I test drove the demonstrator last June.I think the first thing to understand is whether there is a significant difference between tyre models and wheel sizes, so perhaps forum member could say what tyre size and make/model their Q5 has and if they consider their car to be road noisy.So, I have a TFSI with 18inch, Michelin Lattitude Sport tyres and the car has a lot of intrusive road noise.The demonstrator had 19inch tyres, tyre brand unknown and the car is no longer at the dealer to find out, and road noise was minimal.I'll be returning to the dealer this week and will ask to drive their current demonstrator, and will report back here.Any further results would be very welcome.Click to expand...Hello ,Rexus,I have just purchased a 2021 Q5 and I am having the same road noise problems.

Hello...I have a 2014 Q5 TDI that I need to replace the shocks and struts. I have two questions I was hoping I could get some feedback on.1) do you need to replace the coilsprings at the same time or would it be a good idea to replace at the same time?2) I was looking at the Bilstein B4 to retain close to a factory ride. Anyone have any experience with the shocks/struts?Thanks in advance.
Springs are not so expensive. I would replace. You might want to check condition of the bushes too
No need to rush. I got mine next day delivery from EBay. If you look you will see the sellers reference what caps fit each year / model
"Thanks, I've have looked and hard to tell how good they are, as I guess the quality level will differ quite a bit and don't really want to Audi prices for genuine ones.Did you get black ones, do you have the link you used?"

"Hi, which OBD reader is the preferred one to use.I've used Carista before, but not used or experienced Carly or OBD 11.Any recommendations ?"
I use Carista. OBDII appears to have a better interface?What do you want to do?
"When I bought my car, I paid for the 12months subscription and used it to enable a few function's my car (e.g. Needle sweep, alarm beep, fog lamp on during turning etc), but that's expired now, so was looking to re-purchase, but was thinking is it worth using something else, as I know with carly you can pay a bit extra and can use on other makes (as my wife has a Mercedes) plus Carly gives a better description of the fault code, but with Carista and OBD11 you can use it to do dpf regens etc, so they all have there pro's and cons."
"They all have their Pro's and Con's. Some are more simple and easy to use, some work with non-VAg cars, some allow long coding. You need to look at each and decide what suits your needs best. I started with VCDS then Carista then OBDeleven."
"I started with VCDS, too damn difficult for me. Carista does all I want."
"I've looked a VCDS and feel the same as you. I've used Carista before to enable a some features but my subscription expired, so hence seeing if something else around, as may need to requirement to do Battery registrationI've had a few emails back from Carita team about which version you can do things like DFP Regen and Battery Registration and said need to pay a new subscription for pro version to do Battery Registration."
"I don't pay yearly sub, just pay 1 month when I want to use it then cancel."
"Me too. Couldn't do battery registration with Carista so went to local vw audi specialist. £20. (Watched it done, it isn't simple)."
"Ok thanks, the email I got back from Carista yesterday said that to do Battery registration the 'Pro Version' is required which is the paid subscription, so will check with them again.Yes, I believe it not that straight forward, as need to enter the new battery details (Amps per hour etc), so the car charges it correctly."
Me tooI changed battery and got Audi to code it. I see Halford offer replacement battery with coding. Not sure I would trust them to change a fuse :-(
"agree with that, I believe its £27 (that what is says on there website) to get it done at Halfords"
Welcome to our forumWhat warranty will you get from dealer?
"Unfortunately no warranty. The car is sold from the dealer just so the seller avoid some taxes. On my side I have a better price for the car, so that’s a win-win. It’s a common way of selling your car in Canada if you are buying a car from a dealer.Btw he also changed the spark plugs and air filters. I checked the maintenance schedule and everything seems up-to-date."
Good luck
Thanks!Do you think I should not buy? 👀
Welcome to the forum. I wonder if the saving on the car is worth the lack of warranty?
"It is what I'm starting to think too... On top of that, insurances and rates are a bit crazy..."
That would depend on what price. I would be cautious buying a modified car with relatively high mileage.
I would suggest you compare price with other cars for sale in Canada. There is no need to lower suspension to fit 20in rims.
Yes you are right! it was more for aesthetic because without this it looked a bit weird with the mags 20 he told me.
"Some like their car to be slammed / lowered stance. Perhaps you do?It will negatively affect the ride quality, which is already firm on a standard SQ5."
"To be honest, I don't know, I will test the car tomorrow!"

"So I've had the 2022 Q5 or several months now. One thing that periodically bothers me and finally pissed me off now is that most of the times when I start my car, it shows a dialog box telling me that myaudi settings have changed and asking me to either Discard or Apply them.Over time, I was exploring to see what option I choose would not wipe out the favorites. And I was leaning towards simply clicking on the upper left X of the dialog box. But even that is wiping my favorites. Clicking either Discard or Apply wipes it too. So I'll have to re-add radio stations all over again each time when that happens.Does anyone know how to deal with this and preserves the favorites?Thanks,Brian"
"Hi Brian, Sorry to point out the obvious but you have a new car, I'm sure you could take into the dealer and they would help sort it out for you. Seems like you have a software issue if it keeps doing that."
Hello I was just going to check to see if anyone successfully resolved the problem. Looks like it is an ongoing issue that isn't resolved yet per my googling. It's hard to show them the problem when it's not reproducible at will.
"Try. Settings-Privacy-Activate Privacy.Another work around is to log in as a guest (then put your settings in).Both work around lose some functionality but gets rid of glitch.Suggestions from Google and you-tube, not mine."
Thanks Richard. The only thing I tried was to change login to guest and then log back in as myself. This is from Googling. But that didn't work for me.So I'll try these two workarounds and see.Thanks very much!Brian
I can't get the Settings-Privacy-Activate Privacy workaround to work.But simply using Guest works for the time being.This sucks and Audi should reimburse for inconvenience. This has been there since at least 2022.Brian

"Hello everyone!#1- I have a new Q5 S Line Premium Plus with just 5k miles. The past few months, I have noticed an annoying, vibration/rattling noise coming from the center console. It comes and goes but happens mostly at lower speeds. When I press down on the shifter or on the left side of the console, it goes away. Has anyone else experienced this? The dealerships are backed up for weeks and are no help right now. Not good for a new 60k ""luxury"" truck.#2- At low speed stops, I am experiencing a light grinding/growling sound from the front driver side brakes. Not a squeal but a light grind.

Welcome. Maybe a vehicle breaker could help.
Have always cleaned my cars myself except for the last 12 mths.Ageing process and bad back so resorted to using local hand wash car wash which has been fine. Previous car had 18 inch alloys but had no problem.However with my new Q5 and 21inch diamond cut wheels I can’t see any option but to revert back to car cleaning myself. I am reading lots of horror stories where diamond cut wheels are ruined by the acidic pre- wash that is applied. I have no idea what the local car wash uses but I doubt if it is anything special. I also have a Tesco “Wave” car wash within a few miles and I understand they use autoglym products. However yet again I have read in their reviews that they too have ruined some diamond cut wheels .So it seems back to diy…..unless there are any other sensible solutions I haven’t thought about??????????
Just had mine washed and all glass inside and out cleaned by local valeter using Autoglym cost me £17 but felt it worth it as done with good products and no Grit’ on sponge !Suggest ring around valeters asking for prices in your area
"Thanks for the suggestion. Good thought, I’ll see if I can sort a local valet -initial research though appears most are around £50 a time which is a bit steep for all I need. Will keep looking!"
"I wonder if this applies to me. I have a 2022 Q5 Prestige. But I'm in the US.Searching through the specs of the car, I don't see the phrase ""Diamond Cut"". Still makes me worry cuz I need to wash my car soon..."
"Not sure of US wheel spec as I believe likely to be different to UK. Am also no expert on diamond cut wheels as they are new to me , but have read of a number of instances where acid based cleaners have caused untold damage to diamond cut wheels. The acid can strip the surface and allow water to penetrate and make them ugly apparently. I am still trying to sort a local valeter. If I cannot do that my plan is to buy a bottle of PH neutral wheel cleaner and get my local car wash people to use that instead of whatever unknown substance they use on every car .Hope that helps and I am sure someone with better knowledge than me will chip in here."
I had diamond cut wheels on Mercedes E class and local car wash use ‘acid’ which caused damage to surface of wheels causing paint to bubble - had them refinished at local paint shop.Now only use PH. products - but for health reasons now difficult to wash car myself hence getting just a wash at local Valeter.Agree with your suggestion of getting local car wash to use your product - I used Bilt Hammer and it is ‘kind’ to wheels .
Thank you for the sound advice. Sorry you had to go through that expensive experience.

Nice reflected selfies
"The Autohold is a one-time set and forget feature. It stays on all the time so that the brakes are ready to hold you when you stop temporarily in traffic or on a hill. As you say, press the foot brake firmly when stopped and you will see the green brake light lit on the dash. There’s no need to manually engage the parking brake switch (“handbrake” equivalent) unless you are leaving the car. The parking brake when engaged is shown by a red brake light on the dash. You will also hear the servos on the rear discs engage.The online pdf manuals I found are all North American so have a few key specification differences eg headlights."
Thanks again Bulla -got it. Am assuming once it’s set then after each journey it will still remain set? Just been looking at a BMW site which clearly shows polarised views on their autohold system .A lot love it -but an equal amount hate it. It seems many prefer the “creep” in traffic jams so turn it off. I am not sure with Audis but others indicate that if you engage Autohold then stop and turn off engine the parking brake will engage and light up too?…
"Yes, Autohold remains set until you switch it off. On the Q5 the parking brake only seems to engage automatically when you switch off the engine if you park on a slope. Our Audi Q3, however, does engage every time the engine is switched off which I prefer."
Cheers Bulla
Hi first Audi after 5 LandRover'sBought new Q5 40 TDI S line 19 wheels on Conti Sport tyresHad a test drive prior to purchase but now think demo which was a higher spec that Sline may have had adaptive suspension.Ride is very poor especially up to say 50 MPH.I have reduced all tyre pressures to 29 PSI per sticker comfort setting- not made lot of difference.Is this the 'norm' for S line or any suggestions?Many thanks
Welcome to our forumRide quality is very subjective. I hope you did not specify sport suspension option?
I just the ‘S’ line
If you wanted maximum comfort then adaptive suspension would have been the option to choose. S Line suspension like with all manufacturers sporty trim are firmer by nature as the are suited for a more sporty (less body roll) drive = firm.
The Sline sports suspension is quite firm by design. This is the standard setup and there is no option to order the Sline trim with standard suspension.
I need to replace the tyres on my Q5 I have 20” wheels. What’s the best tyre? I’ve heard Michelin latitude are good?
This question gets asked on a regular basis and you will get a dozen or more different answers. There is no such thing as a 'best' tyre as we all have different tyre criteria. The last thing you want to do is to spend hundreds of pounds replacing your tyres to find out that you don't like them. This then devalues the driving enjoyment that you have. If you like the tyres you currently have then the least risk option is to replace them with the same.
"Hey folks, I've found a single owner 2010 Audi Q5 with 95,000 miles that has had most of its service done at lamb's automotive.I am not able to find much more than that. At this mileage point,Is there anything I need to be particularly worried about or keep an eye out for a while inspecting it and taking it for a drive. I've had many Hondas and Nissan/Infinitis before and am very handy with maintenance work myself. This will be my first Euro pick so kindly educate me as much as you can. I've searched around and found both good and terrifying reviews so I'm posting here to see how folks are doing with their Q5s.https://www.carfax.com/VehicleHistory/ar20/yslbDboaBK_XFQJWV20IVirckSaKA2Jyn1tfvniA-CfO8FCZloBKdKI4AzrTu8WEzHyy6NmakFFHt7S4qG_Nqa4j98AEOAn6xR4"
Welcome to our forumand good luck with your Q5
"I bought a 2014 3.0 TDI SLine with 120k a year ago. I've had to replace a wheel bearing and a crank pulley. Having said that, I love the car and it's a pleasure to drive so I don't mind spending some money on fairly standard upkeep!"
"The Q5 sports seats were aesthetically pleasing but they have not been kind in regards to comfort. Anyone else in the same boat? I had to swap them out for the standard seats and my back has been thanking me for it. Just another thing added to the storage in my garage with less than 3k miles of use on them...Would love to hear everyone's experience with them! If you're interested in taking them off my hands, message me directly."
I have the sports seats and honestly think they have been the most comfortable I’ve had in a car. But everyone is different right. Hope somebody takes them off your hands./Jeremy.
"Hello everyone,Audi Q5 is a line of luxury cars from Audi. The car is equipped with a lot of modern technology with a very nice interior. That's why I wanted to buy myself a Q5. How much is the car price right now?Thanks everyone."
This does not warrant any further replies......
"What is the dealer's cost ? What % off of MSRP for a Q5 Audi? Thanks, Mike"
Welcome to our forum
"Hi guys, my b9 q5 was acquired last month as a used vehicle. I noticed that the car jerks when decelerating to a stop almost every time. Sometimes it’s more noticeable than others. Anyone know if this is a typical dual clutch issue or is my car having fly wheel/ transmission issues?Ps I have done the “quick fix” where you turn the power on and press the pedal for 20 seconds. This made the car a bit less jerky but it’s still very annoying."
Sounds like the classic mechatronic problems.
Agreed. How does it feel in reverse going up a hill? Hopefully the car is under a warranty...
Haven’t paid to much attention in reverse but the car also does the same heavy “slap” when I initially hit the gas in reverse. But on the freeway car feels just fine.
Learning the functions on my new to me Q5. Have been impressed with the phone call quality using AudI connect. Thought I would get used to the steering wheel functions first then Audi connect functions then Apple CarPlay( again new to me) then all the driving assistance functions.However tonight I got caught out. Driving at dusk in the fog I tried to phone home without taking hands off wheel. When trying to make a call I had a message come up saying I was connected to Apple car play. Apple car play was set up by my dealer but I don’t recall changing settings. No easy place to pull over so the call was not made. Sorry this is an obvious question to most- but as a newbie how was I then supposed to make a call via Apple car play using the steering wheel function????Thanks.
….and is there a way of switching back and forth between AudI connect and Apple car play via the steering wheel?
Ok I think I have finally worked it out.Please could someone confirm my understanding?-I have to switch between Audi Connect and Apple Car play on MMI screen.-In Audi connect short press phone button on steering wheel will bring up phone list-In Apple car play mode long press on phone button will enable voice input via Siri on Apple car play.Am I on the right track please?Thank you.
You are doing well. I still haven’t figured how to use all the functions on my system
"Hi All,just purchased a2019 Q5, everything going well until a week or so ago, after a cold start and driving for 40 yrds or so i noticed a vibration through the wheel which i thought was the road surface ,but turned out not so, then there was a noise which i can only describe sounded like the tappets like the older cars used to sound, then more worryingly reduced power which affected the pulling out from a junction, once we got going it seem to correct itself and return to normal although it doesnt sound 100% to me, but that could be just getting used to a new car. any ideas or advice would be appreciated.PShad it back to main dealers but after diognostic and road test nothing was found TIA....."
Welcome to our forumGood luck with your issue
I would check to make sure it has the correct oil and filter first.
"i would think it has, its from main dealer."
Hopefully a main dealers of audi....Car (from this and other posts) sounds problematic.
"I have heard reports of engine mountings needing to be replaced. However, if that was the issue, I would have hoped dealer would have easily spotted it.I would take it to an inde. If they could not identify the problem, I would reject the car."
"Audi just got back to me about booking it in again, see what they find, or don't."
"Might want to test drive a.n.other used Q5 to get a comparison with yours. Useful if you get the ""they all drive like that, Sir"" BS."
"Good idea that mate, I'll ask them about that...... 👍"

"Hi,just a follow on from my post, after going back again to audi for further investigation they now say that they're thinking the problem lies with a high pressure fuel pump being faulty and are willing to replace it, (thanks audi) only had it 2 weeks, they did let me know it would cost £2500. not sure if they wanted a helping hand tyo pay or not........"
Good news
"Counting down the days to collecting my first Audi so time for todays silly question.Moving from 18in tyres with good rubber overhang and no issues with curbs to 21 inch tyres, for me is probably just about a matter of time before hearing that horrible curbing grinding noise….……However to delay the inevitable I was just wondering (apart from just being careful) if anyone uses their cameras to park and avoid curbing ….and if so what mode?"
"The 21"" wheels have 40 profile tyres so the likely hood of kerbing is minimal. Yes, I use the 360 camera to park, it is very accurate positioning the car from the kerb. The front and rear cameras/sensors I use so that I don't thump anything."
Thanks for the reply. Not sure exactly what 40 profile means - does that mean in the real world it is likely rubber would connect with curb before alloy on light touches?I’ve got to be honest I didn’t pay much attention. It wasn’t quite an impulse purchase- but not far off- I certainly did not test drive as long as I should. Hopefully not buyers remorse. Wife has terminal big C and focussing on car purchase has been a bit of a distraction.
"Hi,So sorry to hear about your wife. Enjoy every minute of the time have together.Don't worry about kerbing wheels. It really is not such a big deal and you can always get them refurbished.40 profile is the height of the tyre as a percentage of the tyre width. In this case, the profile, sometimes known as the “aspect ratio” is ‘40’, which therefore means that the height of the tyre is 40% of the tyre width."
You can also get rim protectors fitted. Mind I have only seen red but I would expect you could get other colours.
Yes have viewed a couple of you tube videos on rim protectors. But if I recall there are instances of damage being caused by fitting these so not totally sold on idea. I guess they may help with very minor bumps. Wondering if anyone else here has used them.
I also have a Vorsprung model with 21 inch wheels. I have had mine for two years now and touch wood have not curbed them yet! I had 18 inch wheels on my previous Q5 so understand where you are coming from. For me crucially the ride is great with the bigger wheels due to the adaptive suspension the Vorsprung model has. Guarantee you will love the Vorsprung model. Best wishes.
"Thanks very much Skiman. Only picked it up yesterday and about to post “first impressions” Very interested to learn more from you e.g. which driving mode you use to get optimum comfort / do you use Apple Car play or the Audi system, are you planning to renew Audi connect ? Any other tips? finding all the tech stuff a bit overwhelming just now-am sureI will get used to it ! Many thanks again!"
"Thanks for this. Agree with you re the app. Can’t see the location part yet but I’ll work it out. Heated massage seat are great-doubt if I will stop using them until the Summer. Are you diesel,or petrol? Mines petrol av about 28-29 mpg.Agree with the tech (as per my separate post” first impressions’-its overwhelming.Thank you once again.Geoff"
"Mine is a diesel, despite the anti diesel sentiment at the moment I still love it and suits my needs perfectly. I average about 45/46 mpg so cannot complain. The problem I will have in the future will be finding a car like this again that I will be able to afford. I bought my Q5 Oct 20 and good a massive discount which is no longer available."
Yes totally understand re the future affordability issue. Due to the current component shortage and I guess most dealers having a 12mth plus wait for new cars the second hand market seems over inflated. I never thought I would pay £50k for a second hand car but then again I didnt think I would retain close to 60 per cent of the purchase price of my 6 yr old Merc so it’s all relative I guess. I was torn between keeping my Merc (which hasn't missed a beat) and driving it into the ground -but with my annual mileage I think I would have been in the ground first. My plan is to keep the Q5 it all being well for 5 years -then will it have to be some Korean 4 x4 I wonder. I feel they are making progress…but…
I think I will be keeping my Q5 Vorsprung for the foreseeable. I normally would part ex it after three years. The good thing with our models they have every option on it and the technology is bang up to date so probably future proofed for many years to come. I will then look at electric motors after that reluctantly.
"Blowers said:Finally, yesterday picked up the 18 mth old Q5 Vorsprung as shown in my avatar . Purchased under approved used scheme from main dealer In Buckinghamshire .Part exchanged my 6 year old low mileage Merc GLC. The dealer process was ok-but was surprised at the number of papers that had to be signed and the compliance requirements on the dealer. A good thing but took over an hour to sort. Car was very well presented but the boot was soaking wet from a very recent clean. Had to laugh as much to my suprise the large balance of payment went straight through on my debit card with no security requirements - then later in the afternoon used it again for about £20 which prompted a security check-bit late by then!Audi was offering 2 years warranty (a further 6 mths beyond the 3 year standard warranty on this car ) and I was surprised the 2 year service plan was being offered with a 25 per cent discount up to year end. £16 and a few pence mthly seemed pretty good so I took that up.Have only driven 15 miles or so back home from dealer, a local family visit to pub and my golf course and back today.I have been a bit concerned about “buyers remorse” -have I made the right decision etc?.This mainly centred around the seats-having made a bad decision in the past on a BMW which I thought I would get used to ,but didn’t, and had to sell quickly. I only had a short test drive in the Audi and couldn’t get the lumbar support to make much difference. Pleased to say that since driving( and checking a new vehicle in the showroom before parting with money) I am confident that the lumbar support is ok- haven't quite yet nailed my optimum driving position but am sure that I will. Particularly appreciated the massage seats -first two setting are fine but not so keen on the third. Have tried different suspension settings but to be honest not feeling a huge difference between comfort /auto etc.A very minor issue can’t believe Audi penny pinching by not automatically adding the extended storage pack on the Vorsprung which has most everything else. It’s around £225 includes boot nets , the little,storage compartment to the side of driver, but most importantly those nets that fit on the back of the front seats are not there .. Not sure about the different interior lighting options- can see the coloured lines but not much else.My biggest gripe is me. Slightly nervous driving what seems significantly different to the GLC which I knew inside out, with everything familiar and immediately to hand. I find the amount of Audi technology quite staggering and its difficult to absorb all the different possible functions and permutations especially the new (to me)driving assistance aids.. Started on the 350,page handbook last night…fell asleep by page 5. It’s ok to read about them but different to decide what to use and how they work in the real world.So far I have managed once not to not be able to find either reverse or drive. Got stuck. Got it sorted but don’t know how I did it.Phone got connected at dealers but when in the car this morning the phone would not connect. Don’t know why. Later today I turned Bluetooth off and on and it finally reconnected but don’t want to fafff about each time.On the MMi scream every time I turn car on it says I have remote access rights-then\it says “”select user“ or “continue” is there any way I can get rid of this screen message please?Also I get a message that says “notes”- “Interior monitor” not sure what that is about and how to get rid of it.I noticed driving home on a main road in the dark tonight that the all-singing lights worked a treat automatically without a need for me to dip headlights etc. -however when I turned off to a country lane with little traffic I had to put main beam on manually and dip lights when cars approached despite lights still on auto setting. Perhaps someone could kindly educate me.I think I should concentrate on just driving for a while as even trying to work out steering wheel functions/hud/the cockpit display and the MMI is a bit much to take in-and I haven’t even started with Apple Car play /map options etc.So after 24 hours I am really really liking my purchase. I am sure in due course I shall love it.Of course any general tips /suggestions on any of the above ..or indeed recommended settings etc or anything else that might help an old fella who has driven for over 50 years would be very much welcomed.(Now can Iget the car to talk to my Alexa device to talk to my Nest to turn the heating up ha ha)Many thanks all.Click to expand...For the auto lights you just need to push the head light stalk forward. The beam indicator light in the drivers display binnacle will turn blue and will stay blue when a vehicle comes towards you though the lights will actually dip automatically. When you are in a built up area the headlight beam indicator will change from blue to white to show that it is deactivated and returns to blue automatically when out of a built up are."
Thankyou. If I recall correctly I had the blue beam indicator light showing to the right of a green indicator light when on the main road. When turned onto a dark country lane the blue light disappeared leaving the green one from which I then had to turn on/off main beam . Perhaps I flicked the stalk by mistake somehow. Another manual search methinks!
In my Vorsprung If the green indicator light is showing you are not in the adaptive light mode it’s just in the regular dipped beam mode. You need to push the light stalk forward and the light turns blue. my Vorsprung is a pre face lift version of yours so it could be different to yours. Until you get used to it it’s weird as you feels you are on full beam and going to blind on coming traffic.

Thank you again
"Hi, I live in Greater London and as you may have read from 29th August next year our mayor has decided to extend the Ulez zone to cover all areas inside the M25My 2013 Q5 2.0 tdi is not Ulez compliant, I find this hard to understand as it is the AdBlu engine model.I've owned this car from new and have only covered 56k miles, I'd love to keep this car, so does anyone know if there is a conversion that can be carried out to make it compliant.Regards Dibs 🤞🤞"
Who voted for this BS? I would move home
"Thats the problem 80% didn't agree, but still it was approved."
Politicians' promises are like ....
HiI do not have heated front seats. Someone suggested that they might have all innards but not connected up. I have a sline special edition 2012. Could this be possible.Cheers doug
"You will have nothing you didn't pay for, no wiring, no elements and no buttons."
"I would be pretty certain you have wiring, they won't make numerous looms depending on what equipment a car has, standard looms will be much cheaper to produce. You most certainly won't have elements or buttons, guess they could be retro fitted but will be very expensive. some guys over on BMW forums have done it but it ain't cheap, best way is generally to buy heated seats out of a wrecked car and fit those."
The wiring is UNIQUE to the car based on only the options ordered - you will have no additional wiring...
"I know Audi inside out.Replacements have to be ordered based on the VIN number for the car.Pick an option - any option you have not ordered on your car and go and find the wiring for it, you won't find it.Be that cruise, be that B&O, ADS, light pack, seats, folding mirrors even things like footwell lights etc etc."
Elements not fitted to all seats only cars that have ordered heated seats.Scale of economics.
"So how do you get a new wiring loom if you need it? Custom build from Audi, I think not. How many permutations would there need to be to suit all customer's specs?BMW do it and Audi don't, odd! Certainly no elements but wiring yes."
"OK we are going around in circles - the wiring is not fitted unless you order the option, the elements not there, nothing is there.As above pick an option and go and look in your car...."
Anyone removed them to gain extra storage?
"First, Happy Thanksgiving to all. I discussed a fuel leak with my 2012 Q5 Premium Plus with the 3.2L. I had the Fuel Filter(pump) replaced along with the seal and lock ring as it was determined that the leak was coming from that age old issue. Well, looks like it is not the cure. I fill the tank and it runs out for about fifty miles before it stops. I don't have personal access to a lift and I am disabled so I am limited right out of the gate. I took it to the abandoned school in my village to investigate further. There is an area where the students entered the building bordered by curbs on either side of the entry area. I drove the passenger wheels up onto the walk and gas poured out quite quickly. It looks like it is leaking towards the Drivers rear of the tank area. I turned the car around and drove the drivers wheels up and it appeared to stop leaking. I found a mechanic who does work on Audi's and has a lift at his home garage. He is a good guy and I believe he will help me out but I am looking for some insight from this group. I was unable to get far enough under the car to see if the leak it coming off the top of the tank or elsewhere. Wish I could have determined that. Thanks in advance with any help."
Welcome to our forumWas your tank full?Should be easy for mechanic to identify and fix.
"Yes, it happens when full. I am hoping it is a somewhat easy fix. Said he will smoke the system when we next get it to him. I appreciate your response."
Could be a stone puncture or failed seal. Ramp and a proper look should indicate.
"Thanks for the insight. Hopefully the mechanics lift will resolve my question. Hoping for a seal or line and not something that compromised the tank itself. Again, thanks."
Having owned a 6 yr old Merc GLC sport premium since new ( best car I have ever had but time for a change) -the biggest change seems simply the technology. (more things to go wrong as some would say!) when I drove my GLC after test driving the Q5 Vorsprung (is this known as prestige non uk?) the GLC suddenly felt old….….Am looking forward to reading the manual learning about all the gizmos from Apple play to blind spot monitoring hud lane assist etc etc etc….and not having to work the silly Merc steering wheel based gear change lever.Was just wondering what others thought about which of the more recent technology advancements they felt most useful. I am sure not all will be ( e.g used the GLC park assist once after collecting the GLC in 2016 …and the second time this week just for fun.)(as an aside how do I put details of the model under my avatar please?)
Many thanks to you Jeremy. Now sorted
Thanks for sharing
"Can somone please explain what this option is. I am assuming it is just a temporary undersized spare wheel, but a bit confused about ""collasible"".Is this a worthwhile option and can it be retro fitted..Regards,Mark"
"if you haven't ordered it, then do it as now it ?110 on initial order but to retro buy it that will set you back cost ?500 (which I found out) luckily I got my dealer to order one on his demo so will get it for ?110if you don't order this you will get a tin of foam to help if you get a flat thats all you getthe collapsable wheel means it fits where your subwoofer is, and once you inflate its a full size spare wheel (not a replica of your alloys) and is only temporary, once used you can deflate it to the small size and put back in the boot"
"Rahoo,I'm a little confused here (probably because my Q5 hasn't arrived yet). I was under the impression that if you have the sub woofer then there is no room left for any kind of spare so instead Audi suppy a can of repair foam. Are you saying that you can get a collapseable spare that will fit in with the subwoofer in place?"
"I've just got the sub but no spare, it looks like the sub would fit inside a spare wheel. The sub is in a round plastic box about 14"" in diameter."
"Thanks Keith,Exactly the response I was after - if you get a chance to posting a picture, that would really sign it.I'll start on my dealer tomorrow."
"thats exactly right Keith...?110 is a good investment as if you just have a slow puncture and use the foam you would have to replace the tyre as the foam would ruin it, and as I have had a few in my time, the thought of a new tyre when you can repair it for ?15 is the only reason I am getting it now..."
"Thanks for the replies....My car is due for delivery in 3 weeks (awaiting shippng)..I am waiting to hear back from salesperson, hope to get the collasible wheel for ?110 it sounds like a must."
"Just replaced my wife's mini cooper with the Q5 and had the collapsable wheel from the start ( Yes the woofer bit sits inside). This is because I have a TT which came with the foam only and will not work in all circumstances. Some members of the TT forum have improvised a spare wheel using a Mark 5 golf GTI wheel which is a match for the TT (no spare wheel available) and fitted the low speed temporary spare. I have followed suit.?110 is a bargain and would recomend for peace of mind, especially if doing any touring. It's always good to be in control of any possible problem."
"my Q5 came with yhe collapsible sparewheelas replacing a wheel on the go can be hasardous on roads with heavy traffic, or when the car is fully loaded, I supplementary ordered the foam : it is much less work if the puncture is not too bad. Indeed you have to repair the tyre ASAP, because the foam should not attach (if so, the tyre cannot be effecyively balanced afterwardi had preferred a normal spare wheel..."
"IMHO, this item should be part of the standard equipment on a car like this - across the range !It needs to be a space saver/collapsible item as I suspect that there are many drivers that could not handle a 255 wide by 20"" wheel/tyre combination at the roadside, certainly amongst the ladies - they weigh a ton!!!"
"does anybody know if the collapsible wheel will fit in with the b&o sound system fitted,also have ordered car with 20"" rims,is the spare the same size?"
"I have ordered the spare with B&O and 20"" rims.The overall tyre/wheel diameter is the same whatever size wheels you have, hence the bigger wheels having lower profile (% of width) tyres. This is to stop the gearbox ratios/speedo readings etc being different with each size of wheel?I think the sub fits inside the spare wheel - it better had as I don't want it (the spare) pinned to the back door - LOL!"
My Dealer has also confirmed that the Collapsible spare wheel does not compromise B&O in any way. He claimed the sub-woofer sits hidden away in the sidewall.
I can confirm that the collapsable spare and B&O are compatible (I have both). I'd take a pic to show only I'm currently sitting in the lounge waiting for a flight across to Perth (delayed an hour so far).
Has anyone else had any success in buying a spare for ?110 after the event? I forgot to order both the spare and the boot mat and I don't want to play with the order as I now have a build date.You would think that if one dealer can let you have one for ?110 they all can.Cheers
"Can somone please explain what this option is. I am assuming it is just a temporary undersized spare wheel, but a bit confused about ""collasible"".Is this a worthwhile option and can it be retro fitted..Regards,Mark"
"Wow - ?537 is well harsh. I've left it with the salesman to see what he can do for now. Like you, I didn't want to risk amending the order.Cheers"
"Would you know the size of the spare time. I am picking up a q5 for my wife and wi believe it has the 20"" wheels on this as standard. So assume spare tyre will be same size or smaller to be able to fit in the boot where sub is currently situated."
"Would anyone know the size of the spare wheel. I am picking up today a Q5 for my wife part ex with her A3 sline, the Q5 has 20"" as standard and assuming the spare will be same size or smaller to be able to fit in the same space as the sub."
"Welcome to our forum. 20"" is not standard fitment and Q5 comes with a space saver spare or a puncture repair kit"
"Thanks for your reply, today I picked up the Q5 and just looking at the paperwork when they did a health check for the car and checking tyres, I see they have marked treads of the spare tyre but there is no spare tyre in the boot. So not sure if Audi being Audi taken it out and not telling me about it. So they can charge me for it."
all have the same rolling radius.
All keyless locking works bar the drivers door which is intermittent. Can the sensitivity be adjusted on a door by door basis?
I would suspect the solenoid.
HiI've noticed recently that a rattle is coming from my EGR. Fuel consumption has also gone up significantly and black smoke also comes out sometimes. The car also stutters and hesitates when going uphill in third and fifth gear.Are these signs of a faulty EGR or is it something else?Thanks
Another silly question from a prospective owner. Adaptive headlights will be new to me and looking forward to some benefit over standard headlights. I understand they reduce dazzle for oncoming traffic. The silly question is-do you still have to switch between full/main beam or does the car take care of everything in the dark? What can I expect in this regard?thanks.
Brilliant -thanks so much -auto and forget. I think I would have trod down the same path as you-dipping when not necessary so a great help thank you.
Leave everything in auto and be amazed by the technology. It not only works with vehicles coming towards you but if you are following vehicles. I call it shape shifter technology.
Thank you
Just wondering how users get on with the adjustable lumbar. I did not think there was a significant amount of support on my test drive and checking my daughters X3 the lumbar support seems far more aggressive on her vehicle. With a dodgy back am just keeping fingers crossed I can find a good position when I collect my Q5!
"It is not very noticeable, but i find it does make a difference. Seats in Q5 are much better than in Q3"
Thank you missile. I think it will just take a while to get used to.Hopefully !6 years in current car irs always going to feel different for a while…well so I convinced myself.
Did try out the massage function-again not very aggressive but could feel it. Perhaps more of a gimmick than really useful. Time will tell.
"Just bought a 2012 Q5. Wing mirrors are supposed to fold but don't. Found it in settings so it's not that. Control knob turns to 'fold' but nothing happens. I don't see any fuses linked to them, but have checked them all anyway.Lane change assist also not working, neither is the dimming rear view mirror. Maybe a link?I'm looking for suggestions where to look next."
Did you by the car from a dealer or private?If its dealer i’d suggest taking it back and getting them to sort it as you just bought it.
I guess you have checked VIN to confirm that you have these options installed on your car.
Awaiting my Q5 45TFSI (UK) and was wondering if it is fine to fill up at supermarkets as opposed to the more expensive Shell V power. Would it benefit in perhaps using v power every third or fourth fill or not really. Fuel consumption benefits?Performance benefits?
"I would say yes to your suggestion of using every now and then, as they have extra cleaning additives. But its difficult to justify with the price of fuel currently."
The Q5 is not a performance vehicle neither is it sensitive to fuel additives. If you use 95 or 99 Octane you will notice no real performance difference as even with the 45TFSI it is not a high BHP engine. Bearing in mind the price differential between 95 and 99 Octane I would stick with supermarket 95 Octane and save money. Now if you were getting an RSQ3 or RS6 then 99 Octane is mandatory.
That’s good. Many thanks for the replies
"Hi, does anyone know the part number for the n/s/f headlight for a 59 reg Q5. This unit has the DRL Led and xenon bulbs and will part number 8R0941003AG fit the bill. My DRL is not working and unsure if its the module or unit that is faulty. Cheers"
Welcome to our forum
Welcome. 941 003 is for 2014 8R. 941 003 is part no for 2009. I can't see that they would be the same with differing part numbers even if it may fit.
"I have had this warning come on today, coolant level is fineAnyone had his happen before and what was the issue?"
Dodgy sensor or a bad connection?
"My 2020 Q5 gave the same warning this morning. However the coolant seems low and I can smell what seems like a slight leak so I'm going to take it in, I'm just not sure if it's covered under warranty."
"So today I started the vehicle, it ran about 30 seconds then started running real rough for about 10 seconds then died. Epc and check engine light came on and now it won't start. Tried multiple times and got a low battery warning. Never had any previous problems. Could it just be a bad battery or probably a more serious issue?"
"Welcome to our forumWhat engine, how many miles?No point in guessing. I would charge the battery then check for fault code with Carista / OBDII / VCDS"
"2.0 engine, just under 90,000 miles"
How old is the battery?
I would code read first. The low battery display could be due to too many attempts to start.Is the alternator belt in place?
"It seems like brake boosters fail quite frequently, has yours failed and if it has, has it failed more than once?are there any preventative measures you can take to prevent brake pedal booster issues?My b9 q5 with 47k on the odometer has a loud squeaky brake pedal with a defective booster so trying to gauge how common this issue is"
Not had this on my car
Is this not connected to the infamous brake pedal issue on the B9 Q5 (at least the loud squeaky brake peadal part)? There is a massive thread on this forum about it. I thought Audi had fixed this or there was at least an official fix for it?
Never had a problem with the brake servo or any other non-consumable item on all my Audi's dating back to 1983
Update: took the car to Audi and it was the brake booster / servo that was not functioning well. They ended up replacing that component and it took about ten days to get the car back.
Free of charge?
Yes car is still under warranty for 2k more miles
"One of the reasons I offloaded my SQ5 was the annoying spring type sound every time you applied the brakes, it was a 2017 B9 with only 27k on the clock.Mick"
"Hi allI've had my Q5 for about 6 weeks now and I've noticed from time to time that the fan continues to run after the car is switched off, sometimes for up to 15 minutes.I called the dealer and they say it's normal, but wanted to check so see whether it's common or not.Thanks"
"Noticed mine doing this a couple of times as well, even after an easy run, it's probably to do with switching off during a dpf regen, hopefully shouldn't be anything to worry about.If it is the dpf a decent run should keep it happy."
All normal.. even if its not had beans esp for TDi
I find its much more likely to to go into regen mode when using Auto/Sport mode as opposed to Eco mode.
This eco mode thing you talk about I've no idea what that means....
"OK thanks. Yes, noticed some heat coming off the rear wheel arch below the petrol flap last week. Makes sense"
Yeah the fan stays on after I switch it off on my q5 too. Never had a DPF regen yet.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Just as an FYI, I've only had the fan run after the engine was off on 3 or 4 occasions in 21,000 miles of driving, so it's not that common for me."
Our Q5 ran after ever shut down... Couldn't tell if the car was on or off.. Would even start to run if you opened the doors on the car next morning in garage. Audi said normal on the phone. Finally took in and error codes said coolent fan was bad. They replaced but it did not resolve the issue so we are still on a loaner car! Will fill in with more when I know.
"Yes, that is normal. Get a hybrid and the battery cooling fan seems to run forever."
Apparently its not Normal. The loaner Q5 we are driving does not do that - and our car is showing error codes for the coolant fan. They are escalating this to Audi. We shall see what happens.
"Hi all. I have a 2012 Tdi 2.0 CJCA engine, manual. Problem started driving up the motorway and the turbo popped. Got a new turbo from fast turbos, £400. Fitted with new gaskets and feed pipe. Problem is boost. It doesn’t kick in until around 2700rpm. Feels like it’s being strangled before then. With foot to the floor it feels like it’s holding back, and clouds of blue/grey smoke come out the back then boom, turbo cuts in, after what feels an eternity And no more smoke out the back. Drive it hard and it seems ok. If gentle use it’s a pig, it just doesn’t seem right And won’t boost up. Have stripped and cleaned EGR and cooler. Replaced vacuum solenoid, smoked tested all vacuum lines, checked air flow readings etc. no fault codes show except p0299. drove 250 mile round trip today to fast turbo workshop and they plugged it in, drove it etc and say the turbo is good, has the right pressure etc and everything is communicating and doing what it should. To me it feels like the wastegate isn’t set up properly. Turbo shop say it’s blocked dpf but that doesn’t show any fault codes. he Says it will have sucked oil up and maybe blocked dpf hence not boosting correctly. I’m into it for about £1200 quid now. MAF changed too. Carbon cleaned today but no difference. Anyone any ideas"
Good luck 🤞
From what you've said sounds like you should get the DPF cleaned.
"Check for any wheel curbing or any scuffs on the tyre sidewalls. Drive in a straight line at say 30mph, take your foot off the accelerator and let go of the steering wheel. The car should go in a straight line and not pull from side to side. Drive in a straight line at say 30mph, let go of the wheel then brake. Again, the car should stop in a straight line. Look in the wheel arches to check that they are clean. This will show how well the exterior was looked after. As regards the inside, check for any reasonable wear and no damage to the upholstery. Check that the tow-bar has been fitted properly. I am sure that you will get further help."
Ask an audi dealer for a print out of the service history. Any non audi history should have receipts. Looks a nice car. Are all tyres the same on each axle and with good tread?
"Thanks for everyone comments, I've gone through everyone commentsI sincerely appreciate all who contributed to this thread, I found your suggestion really helpful.

Looked on there! Nothing for my year.. can see up to 2017 but there different to mine. I’ve been looking into this for weeks and not getting anywhere. Cheers
I would guess the process will be similar?
Our Q5 Vorsprung has just turned two years old with 14k. Just gone in for its service and been advised that it has a oil leak from the gearbox. This will be seen to under warranty. Just wondered if anyone else has had a similar problem.
"Hello, yes I have the same problem. Bought in August 2021 a new AUDI Q5 in Cyprus and this very same problem exists."
Hope you got it fixed ok.
"The MMI on my 2010 Q5 is ancient. Is it a simple question of getting an up-to-date SD card in order to bring it more up to date or is the process more complex than that? Thanks in advance, Dave"
It depends on what spec MMI you have? There are companies who can offer support. A better option might be to install an Android unit.

"Hi, New to the forum from the UKWe are looking to get a 2017 or 2018 Q5, the updated version, but struggling to decide between the petrol tfsi and the 2.0L TDI, mostly worried about fuel consumption. there seems to be a bit of a mixed bag of real life MPG numbers around so hoping to get a bit more info if anyone has some reliable numbers.our driving will be a 30ish miles per day A and B roads, and a few longer weekend trips max 100 miles per trip.The only other thing im thinking about is its right on the time for a timing belt change for the TDI's, which im guessing wont be cheap and sales gararges wont fancy picking this up for us.Thanks in advance"
Welcome to our forumDiesel will always be more fuel efficient than an equivalent petrol engine.Both engines are likely to cost similar for repairs maintenance
"Thanks for the response, has anyone got some real life mpg numbers for the 2.0l petrol engine?"
"I struggled to get 25mpg from 2.0TFSI.However, it really depends on how and where you drive.How does your current MPG compare to manufacturers number for your current whip?There are lots of posts on this and other forums with wildly differing figures."
"Long term avge for my '19 petrol is about 32 indicated, so probably 30+ really. On a longer run, mostly motorway, it can do 40+ without too much effort, assuming not smashing the speed limits significantly."
"It is impossible to provide an accurate economy figure. It depends on road type, road conditions, tyre conditions, if the vehicle has been looked after and how you drive. Generally a diesel will be more economical than a petrol. However, due to advances in petrol engines, the gap is narrowing. There is one other major factor, where you purchase your fuel from. If you go to a supermarket for petrol and say Shell for diesel then petrol is more economical."
2018 40tdi diesel. Mixed driving around 42mpg. Careful motorway 75 ish and A roads 46 ish. Less by around 10% in cold winter.
Good day all - apologies if this has been asked before but I couldn't find anything. I have a 2010 Q5 and have just bought a set of roof bars. Are there specific ski holders or a specific top box that fits the bars or is there a sort of Halfords fits all?

Welcome to our forumHave you tried clearing errors and do they recur?
"Yes, errors were cleared about 500km ago. They came back (inconsistently though - they CEL comes on, then goes away and then reappeares)."
Try looking at the parts diagram onaudi.7zap.comfor the location.
"If you know or find a competent mechanic you can give them the instructions (from that other thread) on how to replace the speakers. Which is what I did and they have been working fine ever since, as I'm based in Scotland and definitely not driving to Bradford! Or if you have all the tools needed (welding machine etc) you could do it yourself."
"Don't forget a bit more expensive option is to order a new left and right tail pipe with OEM speaker and replace them yourself / mechanic / Audi. I was quoted £540 per side (not fitted just the part) from Audi Parts Direct who are a main Audi dealer (Bath Audi, Bristol Audi and Cardiff Audi). Only problem is you wont know which side is faulty or work it out from the error code (and I cant remember lol) to only order one tail pipe."
"Interesting, thats not theworstprice and I'm happy to roll around underneath it to get it replaced - but how would you know which is faulty (without VCDS - I haven't bought that yet, only got Carly).You sound like you're South West based - Bristol based here, I'm very pleased to note that the 21s crash nowhere near as badly as an X3 with 21s and Sport suspension - very pleased so far.Just need to start working through the list of things I want to do to it now"

I have a 2019 q5 with the xenon plus headlights. They seem really dim. Anyone upgraded to a different bulb or have a similar experience? Thanks.
"I'm not a great fan of the Diamond polish combined with grey paint finish on the 20-inch alloys on my FY SQ5. I much prefer the silver painted options that were used on the previous generation. There are plenty available to buy: only thing is, they have different fittings. Mine are 8J with ETA 39 offset. All 1st generation styles are 8.5J with ETA 33 offset. I’ve done a calculation onwilltheyfit.com, and it says they’d sit 0.3mm closer to the suspension uprights on the inside and poke out 12.3mm further on the outside.I’m fine with that but my concern is the clearance between the wheel spokes and front brake calipers. The gap there is minimal. Has anyone tried this and has it worked?Thanks in advance."
Yes; that's also an option I'm considering. But my original question still stands.
"The real problem with playing with wheel/tyre sizes and wheel offsets is, will the tyre hit the inner wheel arch at full lock? I would not take the risk. Missile has the best, lowest cost and least risk solution."
"If you do change wheels and offset, I would also suggest you get 4 wheel alignment checked by a competent specialist, i.e. not Halfords or Quick Fit"
"Yup, I have a Hunter-equipped 4-wheel alignment centre five minutes walk from home."
"I’m aware of the risks, which is why I raised the question in the first place. It’s something I’ve done before when I changed the wheels on my B8 S4 for S5 rims. The offset change (ETA43 to ETA32) improved the car’s stance immensely with no fouling issues at all. I’d like to achieve a similar effect on the SQ5 if I can, as it does look a bit pigeon-toed on the OEM wheels. I was hoping to find out if anyone had done it first."
"Yes, they really are the best of both worlds. They are good quality wheels from a well regarded manufacturer, rather than a Chinese replica special, and yet they easily pass for OEM to the casual observer."
They will fit my stock 19s I put 245/55 and 275/50 in rearranging so go with same size w 20 but maybe drop the rears to 45 an fronts to 50 But othr front is 29.5 tops my 245/55/19 got 1/8th inch clearance but that’s enough😁
Good morning all I’m new to this forum and Audi ( currently VW ). I have a Q5 tdi s line on order and was adding the tow bar to the build and my question is what’s the difference between the 2 tow bars in the options on build ? 🤷‍♂️Any info is appreciated
"I believe the difference is most likely a plain tow ball versus one that interacts with the towing assist package. If I’m correct then the latter isn’t usable with a caravan as the hitch rips up the tow ball and is therefore only suited to boat, horse or plant trailers, not anything with a Alko or Winterhoff anti snake hitch."
"Thanks for that, wasn’t sure if it was only fitted for 7pin electrics ( with a 13pin plug )"
"Hi all,I have a 2018 3.0L Q5, currently on the standard 19"" wheels with 235/55 tyres.

Seller also has another set of 17"" wheels with 235/65 tyres on, would these be a better bet as they're a deeper tyre?Am I best steering clear of 17"" wheels irrespective of the tyre size on them?Thanks"

"Hi, first time post as I’ve not long found this forum and not long had my Q5, 61 plate 70k miles and only really bought it for towing our caravan.But now I’m currently sat waiting for the AA, after giving it a little bit of a tickle to get round a tractor, nice big puff of smoke from the rear then coil light and no power. Any ideas of what it could be ?Thanks 👍"
With the engine off can you smell anything? If you turn the ignition on but not start the car do the dash lights go on then all the correct ones go off?
Welcome to our forum
From your info it sounds like it could be a fuel pump or filter issue. I would have an indie check it over to check that there is no engine damage.
"Thanks for the help, at least I’ve got a starting point now as the AA didn’t seem much use to be honest. Will be getting it booked into garage asap to get it checked over."
"After having the AA out again on the driveway to try and get a better diagnosis. He pulled up the same code as I’d earlier posted.The in tank pump works, he’s leaning towards pump, injectors or fuel rail sensors. But these can’t be tested at roadside to get a half decent answer of what would be needed?"
That is a shocker.
What caused the initial problem?
"Caused by swarf in the system, then just been unlucky by it taking out 2 injectors completely, blocking the other 2 and fuel pump"
Where do you think swarf came from? Supermarket fuel?
"I’m assuming so, I’ve only had it a couple of months and I never use supermarket fuel. Bought it off an older couple who owned it from new so my guess would be 70k miles of supermarket fuel from them.But hey ho once it’s repaired hopefully there’s not a lot else that can go wrong 😂"
The older couple probably never revved it properly. So the dirt was probably building up somewhere.You boot it and it all dislodges all at once.You are probably right biting the bullet and getting everything done at once.That way you know it's all done and behind you.
@Dowieyeah that’s probably the case I’d assume.car is now up and running and fueling fine but is now tapping when stopping at a junction ( it wasn’t before it went in)garage saying possible valve springs . Would this be related at all?
I hope it's not timing belt / chain & tensioner. That is a common problem. Parts are cheap to replace but a lot of labour to install.
"Did you go to a franchised Audi dealer, a recognised Audi indie or an indie."
It went to a local Audi / VW specialist
Bearing in mind the potential complexity of the problems does your specialist have direct access to the various levels of Audi technical support? I am just trying to cover all bases.
"Hi, first time post as I’ve not long found this forum and not long had my Q5, 61 plate 70k miles and only really bought it for towing our caravan.But now I’m currently sat waiting for the AA, after giving it a little bit of a tickle to get round a tractor, nice big puff of smoke from the rear then coil light and no power. Any ideas of what it could be ?Thanks 👍"
Sometimes cheapest option is not best.
"I’m not sure what access they would need to technical support, they have a good reputation as a VW/Audi specialist which is why I chose them to carry the work out.And it was not the cheapest option by far, works so far have cost me just over £3500 all genuine parts used.They have come up with the knocking is coming from the bottom end, so it will need to be stripped for further investigation. But looking at the fault codes I’m leaning more towards a fueling issue? But I’m not a mechanic."
To address any technical issue there could be a requirement to escalate the issue to engineers who have greater technical knowledge.
A visit to my Audi dealer workshop and sight of the huge range of specialist tools they are required to hold reassured me
I’ve just ordered a 2018 TFSI 45 Q5 sport line from Cinch. They contacted me the day of delivery saying the four wheel drive warning light came on and they’re having it checked by Audi. Is this a common problem with Q5’s? It’ll be my 5th Audi and I’ve never had a problem with any to date.
Why take any risk?
Is anyone of the opinion that the reversing camera is set up for Q5's driven on the right side of the road?
How so?
No

"I have had an aftermarket Westfalia detachable towbar fitted to my 2018 3.0 Q5. Mark from South West In Car Tech fitted it, he's very conscientious and knowledgeable man. He has also remapped it, installed my dash cam and a coolant pre-heater.Its not affected my warranty as warranty work has been done by the local main agent.I've had no issues towing our caravan and when detached there are no indications a towbar has been fitted."
"if you do not make changes that cannot be returned (remove the towbar back without traces), then this does not affect the warranty in any way"
"In the UK, warranty would only be voided where the mod might have caused the failure, e.g. a tune up and engine failure"
Plus if Audi dealer is aware of your mods they sometimes will note it in the electronic service log e.g. engine tune! So even if you later remove it they will have a record of it to void your warranty of the failed part if caused by the mod.
"Just picked up the new-to-me 2012 Sline last week (2.0 with 73,000 kms) First impressions are that it is a fantastic little car except for one glitch…..sometimes it won’t start. The seller (a garage) says he has the parts coming in to fix it (something electronic on top of the fuel pump?). The seller was very embarrassed, had the car towed back to his shop to work on it at his cost, so I’m not too put off. But, does anyone know if this is a common problem that I need to keep spares in for? Seller gave me a 3 month warranty on the electrics and even offered to buy the car back if I wasn’t happy, so I’m sure he will get this annoying glitch fixed."
Welcome to our forumPerhaps you could ask for a better explanation of the fault from the garage?
"If you have lots of cranking then obviously charging system is good.Is it petrol? I would be inclined to remove a plug lead and check the spark or lack of.If diesel, lift bonnet after cranking can you smell fuel?"

While I know the basics, this is my first Audi so I have no idea how the electronics talk to each other. If it happens again I’ll pull an injector to see what is going on."
"Sounds like a fuel delivery issue, could be something as simple as replace the filter. You would expect any competent mechanic would be able to spot that, but ...."
"Yup, will let the group know how it turns out."
"Looks like the problem was in the wiring harness that plugs into the assembly on top of the fuel tank. Intermittent short, no start. Short cleared, no problem. Fun and games, but seems to be OK now.

"I have had the Q5 for 3 weeks and I have yet to use the combustion engine. On a full charge I am getting 32 miles but this can reduce slightly going uphill. With the AC on you lose about 3 miles of range. What the Q5 is is not a larger Q3. The Q5 is better built, uses better internal materials and the MMI is significantly better. I went for the 20"" wheels with the 45 profile tyres. With the state of the UK roads, any lower profile potentially damages the wheels. I have no wireless charging pad but I don't care as it is slow and where the phone goes there is a USB-C. I have no side assist but then that's what wing mirrors are for. My first long journey will be at the end of this month when I am doing a return journey from Leeds to Norwich in Hybrid mode."
After 3 weeks you have yet to complete more than a 32 mile round trip?
"That is one of the reasons I got a hybrid. Analysing my journeys, 95%+ of them are less than 22 miles return. Now I only travel about 8000 miles per year. A couple of decades ago it was about 29000 per year."
"Thank you for the information, I will feedback early next month. As a matter of interest did you use the ACC? I am convinced that this should improve the economy. Also, how do you link the auto hybrid to the sat nav?"
HiHow long did you wait for delivery if you don't mind me asking? I have had mine ordered since December and still keeps pushing back. Now at January 2023.
I ordered mine on 20th October 2021. I took ownership 2nd August 2022. Almost 10 months. A major factor affecting delivery is component shortages. I have a good dealer who regularly provided updates as the user tracking has been disabled.
Ah thats great you're quite lucky. I have mine placed through a lease company which aren't great with updates and I have to keep chasing. It would be great to deal direct with someone who can get updates straight from Audi but I have to keep going through someone. Latest I am told is it's week build 43!
Try and find out what the build status is which would give you a better idea of where it is. Please bear in mind that from the shipping dock it can take 6 to 8 weeks to get to you.
Hi mateIts build status 10...unsure on what that means exactly.
Thanks for that. Gosh that is worrying I am still status 10 and have all that time from when it moves to 20.
Not exactly. To go from 10 to 38 can be as little as 2 weeks. All you can do is to request a status weekly.
"Unfortunately I don’t the ACC option, just standard cruise control. It’s quite easy to set up smart hybrid with your sat nav. Firstly set your journey on the sat nave then toggle the EV button to “Auto Hybrid” and the car will do the rest. On my recent outward 110 mile journey I arrived at the destination just as the battery range went to zero. Page 118 of the manual (if you have the same one) explains and shows the symbol that should have on the VC if correctly set up."
I have just charged the almost empty battery with just 1 mile left. I have a Hypervolt 7kW charger. It took just under 2 hours to fully charge to 32 miles.
I went on a 23 mile round trip on EV only. The first time I did not use the ACC and I achieved 57.5kWh/100ml. The second time I used the ACC and I achieved 42.3kWh/100ml. I wonder if ACC has the same type of improvement for fossil fuelled cars?
"RickyB said:Hi TPD Welcome to the Forum.After ordering my 55 TFSIe last November I got build status 30 on 20th July. Dealer told me that meant the car was made and ready to be shipped from Mexico.1st August it showed as sitting in Emden in Germany with DELAYED status, awaiting CP8 Chipset.I gave the delaer a push on Monday and he told me on Tuesday morning the status has moved to 38, in the port ready to ship to Grimsby.It really can change that quick.Now sitting here tapping my fingers and hoping to pick up from dealer probably around the 5th September..Click to expand...Hi Ricky,Thanks for the information. That's really useful.Mine is the 50 TFSIe so fingers crossed they're slowly going through batches.Thanks again and hope you love your car when it arrives!"
Following on from my previous post. I have this week found out that my model will be 'model 23.' Has anyone else had this?
Mine is an end of line 22. I wasn't given a choice. Do you know what the differences are?
"I have had the Q5 for 3 weeks and I have yet to use the combustion engine. On a full charge I am getting 32 miles but this can reduce slightly going uphill.

"Hi mate,Really unsure at this moment. I did query was this a shape change as I believe a new shape is coming out next year however confirmed it was the one I placed the order against...Confused at this point!"
"Audi update the model year pretty much every year; MY23 would normally be builds starting around Q3 '22. So don;t get too excited, it'll be what you were expecting/ordered.Given the current issues, chances are that MY23 will have reduced spec vs MY22 (if any changes at all) - but you can expect to get what you ordered spec wise unless they tell you otehrwise.The next Q5 might see an appearance late next year, but more likely '24 I think."
Thanks. Yes I would agree. Any idea on where you could get a spec list of the 23?
Hi. I have just got a 2018 Q5 SLine with the upgraded B&O sound system. Do you know if i can install Audi Rings Puddle Lights? I have standard lights underneath my door at the moment. The link below mentions narrow fitted lights but im not sure what that means. I am looking at the link below and the car is not listed. Any help would me much appreciated.Audi Beam LED Puddle lights 4G0052133G X2 Rings Logo Genuine Audi | eBayFind many great new & used options and get the best deals for Audi Beam LED Puddle lights 4G0052133G X2 Rings Logo Genuine Audi at the best online prices at eBay!

No problem with the installation of Audi ring puddle lights. I purchased mine directly from Audi as I have heard bad stories about third party ones. I have done it and it took 10 mins for both sides.
The ones on the link say and look genuine. What do you think? Is your Q5 2018?
"No, mines a 2022. Previously I had a Q3 with basic puddle lights, I bought a couple of Audi ring replacements off ebay and they did not fit."
Was your Q3 2018 which is why you know it will fit? I am going to see if i can order direct as I would prefer to do that for peace of mind
My first Q3 was 2017 and the second was 2020. The issue was on the 2017 one. I successfully moved the ring puddle lights between both Q3's and then to my current Q5. My mistake was ordering them for the 2017 Q3.
I saw some advertised on eBay by an Audi dealer. I just rang them quoted the reg no and were advised that they would fit (there are a couple of different types) easy to fit I borrowed a friends plastic tool with a curved head to remove the original ones).
The good thing about the Audi ring's ones (genuine) is that they are brighter than many of the third party eBay ones.I bought genuine ones (2nd hand) off eBay and then bought some SQ5 ones off a US seller. They are fine but no where near as bright as the Audi ones which I now have in the rear doors.
"I have had the Genuine Audi puddle light rings previously (expensive!), they are nice but but light output is rubbish compared to up-rated (brighter) third party LED plain/non-ring puddle lights. Depends if you what form or function. I went with function."
"Folks, I just bought a Q5 2022 prestige. While the car is all great, I found that the HUD is at an angle that I, being extra tall, can see the speed but not what's above it. I had to duck 2 inches lower to see it entirely.Anybody knows if that HUD can be tilted? I don't see any button to change that.Brian"
"Never mind. Sorry, there is indeed a dial to move it. I should have googled first."

Have you had the Geo looked at Snowman?My experience with the S3 and TTRS suggests there is plenty of deviation from recommended settings when cars roll out of the factory...
Held mine at 135-140mph for a time (private road of course). Was sold as a rock...Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Anyone know what the unlimited top speed of the SQ5 is?
There is a video on youtube of one going to up 275kmh so i assume thats what like 170?! will try and find the link

See him flashing his headlights to overtake? <LOL> I can almost see the fuel gauge going down. Nice link!
"155mph/250kph - so not sure how that video got to 270, VCDS can remove the limit easily...Plus lots of these 'limits' are known not to be that limiting!"
"Maybe I'm use to sporty cars, this does not feel rock solid at all.its like riding a speedboat going over waves - all over the place.speedo design is freaky too, firstly its backwards and the numbers spacing get smaller as the speed increases."
"Feels no different to my 135i at similar speeds... You are comparing to an R8 though so it may be a perceptual thing...I like the speedo as at low speed it is higher resolution, so you can see 31mph compared to 30 clearly - also means 80mph is central so easy to see at motorway speeds."
"I'm not sure I'd have the balls to be going at that pace, especially at 0.5 degrees!"
"I drove it 250km/h in Germany a while ago and it was very steady.Because the car only had 1500 miles at that time I did not go further, but it still had some reserve, I think 265 km/h is certainly possible.https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10200955100146919&set=vb.1448594185&type=3"

"Sorry to revive and old thread but I recently went on a road trip with my 2015 SQ5 TDI, I've only had it for few months now so this was my first long-distance trip...it's perfectly fine up to about 160km/h to 180km/h but I notice when I get to the 200km/h and above it does indeed feel very twitchy, I was tailing a V10 Toureg and I had to tap off around 220km/h because the car just started to feel a bit to twitchy, it's really like mentioned above...""speedboat going over waves - all over the place""Could it be a suspension issue, perhaps... Maybe I should get my suspension tested?"
My steering gets light but not twitchy at over 220Kph
"Thanks for the response@missile, I think that's more like what I mean... not really twitchy like if it's dancing around everywhere but the steering is super duber light so it feels twitchy instead of planted. Is this normal? I'm baffled as to how the guys in some of the Youtube videos are hitting speeds of 260/270km/h with the steering being so light. I've done speeds of 250km/h on much older modified cars that felt a lot more planted than my SQ5. It's a bit concerning and disappointing... I was actually hoping it might be something as simple as wheel weights/balancing that could be the issue...I have 20inch tyres on and was wondering if maybe even wider tyres might help...might be best for me to get a suspension test done anyway just to make sure there is nothing going on there."
The steering is set up for limp wristed snowflakes.Is your car standard or have you / previous owner made changes?
"Anyone taken their SQ onto a private road/airfield for a blast?Thoughts? the car feels very nervous/figity as you hit 100/110, not sure i'd like to take it much beyond that - private road or not.Tyres were all correctly inflated about 3 weeks ago - not checked since.Car was fully loaded with people and cases at the time."

SuperD007 what make and model of tyres are you running?
Hey@SQ-Raphsterthanks for the response. When I purchased the car the dealership had put on of brand new tyres for me. They ended up fitting Blackhawk Street HUO2 tyres. I know it's not as ideal as a set of Conti's or Pirelli's but when I check some of the reviews for these tyres online they seemed okay. Do you think this could be causing the light steering at high speed?
"SQ-Raphster said:@SuperD007no idea if those tyres are any good as they only seem to sell them in SA, it was just my initial hunch. They are however manufactured in China or Vietnam though (which isn't a sure sign of quality), but they are Y rated... 🤷‍♂️Blackhawk Tires – An Uncanny Combination of Value and Performance - SWAGGER MagazineADVERTISEMENT Have you ever wondered how the price of new tires for your car or truck is determined?

I guess I'm going to have to do a deeper dive to see what could be the root cause. Will update the thread once I've done a bit more investigation, hopefully, it's something simple like wheel balancing weights even."
"Blackhawk tyres are manufactured in China since 2002. They do not have the pedigree of established players but I have heard no bad reports about them. Road holding at very high speed is dependant on a number of factors including the tyres. For a tall, heavy vehicle with little steering feedback I would not go in to 3 figures for any period of time. However, if you must, then tyre pressures need to be reduced and the chassis alignment checked or alternatively purchase an R8."
Thanks for the response@mwcltdappreciate your insight on the matter. Reducing pressure and checking chassis alignment seems like sensible first few steps to take to see if it rectifies it. Honestly at speeds of up to 180km/h she is well planted and feels exactly like what a sports SUV should feel like ...just seems to lose a lot of that planted feel when u start hitting the 200km/h range... I have a friend with a 2.0TDI Q5 and he says his car is perfectly fine around the 200km/h mark. So it must be some up with my setup..... R8?....maybe one day when I grow up
"Bwhaahah ohh hell no.....that my friend, I don't have the balls for 🤣 ...had a bike for a short period when I was younger, learned very quickly that I don't have nerves of steel... 😁, got rid of the bike, told everyone it was cos my gran begged me to get rid of it....hahaha I was like 27 or 28...had to save face, couldn't tell everyone I was too much of wimp to even take the bike on the highway...🤣🤣"
"Hi - delivery expected of my Q5 fairly soon now, looking for a decent sized rigid dog crate that will fit. I have a Springer Lab cross. Any tips on one that will fit? (And equally tips for ones that sound like they might, but don’t so i can steer clear)Thanks."
Welcome to the forumSorry no recommendations from me as I don't do dogs or caravans❌Hopefully other Q5 dog owners can advise you

Welcome to the forum. Maybe go to your local Audi dealer and have a look in their boots?
Thanks for the welcome - Mines is a 2019 model so would it be the same or do they change the spare wheel items?

"missile said:Spotted this on a.n.other forum>In case anyone doesn’t already know, if your car is 2013 or newer, it will have the service history as a digital service record and you can actually access this all via the myAudi app.In order to access the Audi digital service history you first have to be “defined as the owner” of the vehicle.There are two ways to do this:1. Go into your local dealership with a copy of the v5c and proof of ID and ask the service advisor to define you as the owner so you can access your digital service history via the myAudi app.2. Call Audi UK customer services, choose the digital service option and they can do it over the phone for you. You will however need the v5c for the car and your passport to hand and also a camera phone as they switch to video to verify the documents on the call.Then once you are defined as the owner, you can go into the myAudi app, scroll down to “Service topics”, click on “Your service area”, then click on “Service History” and all your digital service history will be there.It can take a few hours or a day or two to update so don’t worry if it doesn’t come up immediately.Hope that helps!Click to expand...Didn't actually know we could access it personally.

My audi Q5 experiences a short pulse/vibration in the gas pedal when I hit 45-48km/hr. I only does this at that exact same moment every time. My dealer says that is normal in all audi's and it has something to do with checking ABS function. Sounds like baloney to me. Can anyone confirm whether this is normal or help diagnose?
What flavour of Q5 do you have?
Welcome to our forum
Q5 Komfort 2.0L Turbo I4 AWD
I don't think this has anything to do with the ABS. The Q5 under certain circumstances will give you haptic feedback through the accelerator pedal. Do you have a speed limit set? I would check the various car MMI settings.
good point. I'll check that
"Has anyone used Avon ZX7 tyres on their Q5's, if so what were your views ?Dibs"
"For what its worth.....i had avons on my A4, not sure which spec. They seemed to do the job."
"Well today I had all 4 tyres replaced from Bridgestone to Avon, I saved £56 per tyre, only time will tell if I've made the right decision.Dibs"
"Dibs, please keep us updated.thx, Ronan"
Wii do so far not noticed any difference in road noise and as for grip the old tyres were passed their best so can not tell.
"Hi DibsHow you getting on with the tyres, I am thinking of getting the same set fitted..Currently I have a old set of GY Excellence on the back and New Kumho on the front (Dealer I bought from fitted them).Not sure if I should change all 4 to the ZX7 or get another Pair of matching Kumho for the back..."
"Hi TurGe 24, so far I have to say I have not noticed any difference, the the dealer who recommended them to me has been fitting tyres to my cars for the passed 20 years and I trust his judgement, so therefore I would also recommend them."
"Hi Dibs,How did your Avon tyres fair over the winter?Need two new tyres for my fire engine. Thinking of replacing Bridgestone Dueler with Avon ZX7.Wet grip is most important consideration for me.Both are rated A.Many Thanks"
"Hi Missile I've not noticed any difference from my Bridgestone tyres, but then again I never push the car that hard. When the time comes to replace these I will buy Avons again.Dibs"
"Thanks Dibs, I don't push mine hard either. I suspect it would roll over long before the tyres loose adhesion on a corner."
"It's more the straight line stopping power that I worry about with a big, heavy car.I imagine most people don't push the lateral grip of their Q5 very hard, but those unexpected heavy braking moments are the ones that concern me.Having said that, I had Avon's on my old TT and couldn't tell any difference from the Pirelli's that were specced from new. I do wonder how much tyre technology is just scaremongering."
"The brakes on the SQ5 are really very good.I don't have manyunexpected heavy braking moments, but I do take your point.Grip in the wet is my main consideration and both these tyres are rated ""A"" for stopping distance in the wet.I am not sure how much faith one can have in these ratings?"
On revews theAvon ZX7 are very bad for wear mileage.
"I don't know enough about tyre technology to accurately score a tyre out of ten for wet grip...Which is why I'm not sure I really trust those owner review aggregator sites. And I think the point above just proves why - tyre wear could vary dramatically depending on your style of driving. I would be able to say how many miles I'd covered in a set, I guess, but only if I was really paying attention when I put them on. It really needs a standardised system to accurately record these things.I'd much rather trust the independent tyre tests and ratings for grip and noise."
I fitted the ZX7s and very pleased with the grip and noise . As good if not better than the Bridgestone previously fitted.
Just for info on the Avon ZX7s -2021 Tyre Reviews SUV Tyre Test - Tyre Reviews and Tests
It is interesting to note that different testers have differing results. You pays your money and fingers crossed
"Well I'm on the hunt for new tyres currently as I had a blowout on Monday on the inside sidewall of the font offside tyre by clipping the edge of a flipping cats eye!! So i'm looking at all options in my 21"" tyre size (which is fairly limited). I knew you mentioned Avon's before so wanted to check them out as well."
"Bad luck, hope only tyre was damaged? I am very pleased with my Avons. I drive within the limits of my tyres. My main consideration was grip in the wet as you know it is often wet where we live and some nerds seem to have no knowledge of increased stopping distances and ignore the conditions. They are a menace.Avons were much cheaper and appear to be as good as the Bridgestones which I had previouslyWhatever boots you choose, remember Abz Audi have a price promise."
"Has anyone used Avon ZX7 tyres on their Q5's, if so what were your views ?Dibs"
"Yeah alloy wheen seems fine, taken it off and checked both sides. Never realised a cats eye could be so deadly!! Good to know about the price promise at Aberdeen Audi, but not much use when the car is undrivable currently. Plus I normally mail order my tyres for best price and get them fitted locally. Also the Avon's are not available in my tyre size (255/40 R21)"
"The poorly maintained roads might be a bit of a challenge for 21"" ?"
"Well I have ordered the OEM factory tyres - Pirelli P Zero - 255/40 R21 102Y XL (RO1). I have lost a bit of confidence in the Dunlops currently, and the reports of Pirelli P-Zero PZ4's noise reducing foam coming off doesnt inspire confidence especially when I manage to do more miles out of a set of tyres than most. I will probably keep the non-punctured font axle Dunlop as a spare and the punctured will become a tree swing for the kids outbackThe rear axle Dunlop tyres will probably be replaced with the same P-Zero's when its time even though I'm not keen on different tyre types front to back until then."
First time Audi owner and my state doesn't require front license plate. What are my options to remove ugly front bracket?
so I have to replace the whole grill to go plateless?
No. You just take off the plate. Obviously the mount is a separate matter for you.
yes I have the plate off but looks terrible. I guess I need to buy a replacement piece for grill without plate mount
it is a 2019 but I'm guessing same piece will work

Welcome to our forum
"Have 2017 Q5 (3.0) with about 45,000 miles. Dealer recommends a complete brake job for abour $2,800 (US), saying I've about 3,000 miles left on the brakes. I've received two quotes from reputable shops (per Google reviews) that specialize in such cars, one for $2,200 stating they use OE parts and one for $1,500 stating that all parts other than OEM are aftermarket parts. Before this, I was only aware of OEM and aftermarket. Seems the only difference between the two non-dealership shops is the part cost for the front brake disk rotors. Be that as it may, anyone with any experience/advice on brake jobs performed other than at dealership? Thanks!!"

Just very annoying that any cars ordered now have slide and height adjustments as standard. Trying to not let it ruin the experience of the car and so have a black drinks bottle propping it up 🤣
? My 2019 new style Q5 has a ratchet armrest as standard - just like my 2013 old style model ?
Not in the 2021 models - I got my q5 edition 1 on 29 July 2021 🙁
"'ello 'ello peeps,I've just picked up a brand new 2021 model Q5 40 TDI S-line to replace my previous 8R model Q5. It's a superb piece of kit but for one annoyance. Is anyone else disappointed with the centre armrest? The 8R armrest had a ratchet mechanism that held it in position but this one is just held with friction, as soon as i put any weight on it it drops to the bottom. is this normal?It doesn't extend either. Pants."
"Audi UK are telling me now that once again if you buy a Q5 built as new now it will have the adjustable arm rest, but previous stock builds didnt have this feature. They have apologised for the inconvenience and offered me £250 to go away quietly,it seems to me that either committed to this ridiculous cost down but have rolled back on it now, or they didn’t have enough parts for the adjustable version so did a mod, and now they have stock again, either way it has left me even more annoyed.fuming."
"Picked up my new Q5 yesterday from Southampton Audi. The arm rest is a cheap and cheerful representation of a premium car together with the fact of no phone charger obviously a parts shortage, lets just bung on parts from some bottom of the range model. Most unhappy ruins a lovely car."
100% mate. Im still fuming about it but you cant get anywhere with them on it. Even though their website still advertising a proper arm rest for new builds. They gave me £250 to go away. Id of paid £1000 to fix it!
Yep still fuming too but no solution given 😡
"Crikey, that's very odd indeed.I honestly think my 2019 Q5 is the best of the best and the last of the 'Configurables' - where they had top notch kit fitted properly and you could pick any trim and bolt any option onto it. Now if I want a Pano Sunroof I can only get it in the Vorsprung? WTF? Thanks WLTP - you've really messed things up."
Hi has anyone solved armrest problem?
Shocking omission by Audi on a car that costs this much! Audi obviously went on a value engineering exercise on the mk2 Q5 😐
I have a 2022 Q5 arriving around March 2022. Does anyone know if I am going to suffer with this poorly designed arm rest?
I have a 2021 built July and my armrest is not the crappy one. But looking at previous posts it seems a bit random.
I think it's not random becuse this additional equipment ( aprox 250 eur in configuration)
"Different countries have different standard specifications and different option lists. These are defined by Audi marketing in the respective country and availability. For example, you cannot get a sunroof on a Q5 except if it is Vorsprung specification but if you order it then currently Audi cannot give you a build date."

Yes they are
Please can you share a part number ?The lack of this simple feature is hugely annoying. TIA
"Hi did you resolve this? I tried to get Audi dealer and Audi UK to change mine but they both refused,,,many times? Did a part number?Jon"
Welcome to our forumNot seen that before. I would suggest you ask whoever you bought car from.
I would remove the trim to discover what it is connected to. In the mean time I would leave it unplugged.
"Hi all,just done my maiden voyage towing my caravan with my Q5 stronic and during hilly areas there was white smoke coming from under the car at the front drivers side.I’ve checked the caravan and the car are compatible using the towsure website. Has anyone else come across this issue?"

"Hello guys,I need to replace my old summer tyres 255/45R20. My tyre dealer offer me a Mich. Pilot Sport 4 SUV 105W XL for a reasonable price, and Mich. Longitude sport 3 101W for a like 100$ more per tyre.Car is Q5 Quattro 2014 190HP, and Longitude sport 3 101W is OE tyre for this car. At manufacturer recommended tyres there is no 105 index load for summer tyres, only for M + S.I really don't need extra load or higher load index like 105, but tyre dealer said that 105W XL will perfectly fit my car because that's new technology, and that PS 4 SUV is inherited LS 3.I need tyre that will last reasonable long, and tyre that does not consume a lot of fuel because is heavier, XL, 105 etc...So, should i go for PS 4 SUV 105W XL or find other brand 101W?"
"The load rating makes no difference to tyre wear. The only consideration is that it meets or exceeds the manufacturers specification. As regards wear there are only two variables, the tyre manufacturer and how you drive. The most important factors regarding tyres is how do they behave in the wet/dry and how predictable they are. One day your life could be dependent on these factors, wear is secondary."
I would expect the higher load rating to have stiffer sidewall and harsher ride.
I agree with missile on ride but the higher load rating will have negligible effect on wear.
"but still there is XL, only for 21""... obviously 21"" wheels have less sidewall and perhaps needs to be stiffer?What is your requirement?? Low cost / comfort / grip/ noise.Not all tyres are equal. Load rating is only one consideration. Read some tyre reviews.What is fitted to your car. Unless you have a reason to change(?), easiest option wouild be to replace like for like."
"Comfort. The thing is, I bought a used car that came with pirelli verde 105w XL, now is time to change and I want Michelin, because I like them.My problem is that local dealers overprice 101W tyre by a lot for some reason (I compared prices across Europe), they try to sell me same brand tyre but 105W XL at normal price convincing me that those tires fit my car.I was confused but I will stick with the factory recommendations. 255/45 R20 101W but other brand."

"Cam belt replacement is usually (recommended) with water pump, pulleys and tensioner change. Again fluid change at the same time is optional. Max saving is just change the cam belt. Your choice. Fluid never requires replacement so could be saved and re-used."
"Thanks Richard. Going to go for the full replacement so I know its all done. The 10ml of coolant I have had to top up could be a small weep at the water pump I guess, or I may just have thought it looked a bit lower in the tank than normal. Have put a small mark on the tank so can monitor if it drops before I take it for the cam belt work next month so I can mention."
"Tman, did you get the cam belt done by Audi, reason I ask is that mines due but they’re;e quoting £840! do you mind telling me what yours cost?Thanks."
"Hey Singhy,Yep I was quoted same price by Audi Dealer.Luckily I have now got a local independent Audi specialist. All OEM parts and coolant top up and labour £645."
"Thanks Tman, that sounds more like it albeit still expensive."
"Yep but bear in mind its a pretty labour intensive job. whole front end comes off. The price I paid included the replacement of all cam belt related components...drive belt, tensioners, pulleys, aux belts, water pump and the coolant after air bleeding the system.If you are London based I can give you my guy's number - he worked for VW (air cool back in the day) for many years before moving on to a couple of audio dealerships before going it alone."
"And that's why it pays to get everything else done at the same time. All it needs is for the water pump to fail after the cambelt has been replaced, and it will all need doing again, including most likely another new cambelt as a seized water pump will probably strip the belt."
"Hi every one a new bee here, just bought my q5 75000 miles sounds like i need to change the belt, also are the folding wing mirrors a extra? as mine do not fold!!Cheers"
Welcome to our forumand yes they are an option
I’m struggling to fully charge my car from a pod point wall box even after 7 hours. When the weather is hot the fans start running and charging gets compromise. Anyone else have similar issues or suggestion?
I am getting soon a Q5 55 tfsi e. I have my charger fitted by Hypervolt. Can you control the maximum charge level and can you use the Audi app to see the current charge level.
I’m assuming you are thinking of restricting charge to 80% as recommended for full electric vehicles. There is no reference to this in the Q5 manual and I haven’t found any way of doing this in either my charger app (Andersen) or on the car itself. I think probably because the battery/range is so small it wouldn’t be economic to restrict the charge level further. I may of course be wrong.As regards the Audi app it does show the current charge level.
Thank you for your reply. When you charge yours do you always let it run to 100%?
"Yes, as I’ve not not found a way of restricting the charge short of manually keeping my eyes on the MyAudi app and disconnecting when it reaches 80%."

Welcome to our forumIt may be just a bad connection. It is easy to remove the switch and I would clean and lub the connections.
Thanks very much - I'll give that a go
Hi there James.did you have solution to your problem? as my 2010 Q5 has done exactly the same. thanks.
Hi there - it was a connector in the boot that had come apart. I just reconnected it and it all worked. It’s relatively simple to take the lining out of the boot. Good luck!
"That was good for you, however mine doesn't seem that simple. I took the boot apart, and the connector was alright. I tested the switch with a multi-meter, and it tests fine. I also tested the wiring to the switch. Negative has continuity to earth, which is correct, but the positive has 0.05 volts. I tested the ""boot close"" switch and it has 12 volts. So I believe that I have a voltage supply problem. I could only find two 30 amp fuses in the ""boot lid control unit"" circuit, and they are fine.I don't believe it is a broken wire, but now thinking of maybe some sort of ""voltage control issue""Can anyone help please, or if someone may have a wiring schematic. thanks."

Welcome to our forumNever felt or heard of anyone else with that issue
As it is a fly by wire system with an attendant return spring my guess would be have it replaced before it fails if it is not behaving as it should.
"Pganders said:Yes, I can understand your disappointment. It’s not just Q5s but across the range. I had originally placed an order for a Q3 Vorsprung last November only to have my order pulled by Audi UK days after. I then re-ordered a Black Edition but a combination of items that I had on my previous Q3 being removed from the spec and delivery being pushed out to sometime in 2023 resulted in that being cancelled also. Like you I didn’t want to be handing out £0,000s and end up with a car that was a lesser spec than I already had.By chance I came across an ex demonstrator Q5 that fitted my needs and thought “well at least I know the spec on the car is what I’m getting “. The icing on the cake was that it was one of the last Q5s with the pano roof, which really swung it for me. Have to say very pleased with my decision😀.Click to expand...Glad it worked out OK for you in the end. The Pano Roof is to die for - I literally love it! Mine is open right now in the car-park (secure) as I write this and it provides a far more interactive driving experience - I literally drive with it open nearly all year round when it's not raining and I'm not on the motorway.It's madness how Audi have whittled their cars down to choosing variants rather than choosing options - it was one of their greatest assets in choosing Audi."

"What is a Bluetooth cable? Do you mean a Bluetooth adapter? Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology, not for charging - what you are saying doesn't make senseIf you are just trying to charge your phone get a cigarette lighter adapter to USB-A or USB-C (depending on your phone type) and plug it in under the armrest and charge your phone there. If you have Audi Music Interface (AMI) option on your car, connect your phone via Bluetooth for music as well."

"Seems as so iOS 11 from Apple has messed up the connection. What iOS version is your iPhone running?Try this procedure which is from here (Click me):It seems that it's the phone handshaking with AMI that is failing, but if AMI starts up expecting to find a phone, and one is already there, it works ok. To achieve this, I have to plug the phone into the cable before I put the key in and switch on the primary electrics, i.e. before AMI wakes up. What's more I need to wait a few seconds so that the phone recognises the cable and activates the port. If I switch on too soon the problem still occurs. So typically I plug the phone in first, then put my seatbelt on, by which time I'm probably ok to start car. Conversely when getting out of the car I switch the car off, wait a few seconds, then unplug the phone. So the phone isn't unplugged until AMI has switched itself off completely. Again, taking off my seatbelt and opening the door before unplugging is usually a long enough wait so it's not a big deal.Click to expand...Or try this procedure from here (Click me):I solved this issue with the following steps:1. Disconnect usb/lightning cable from your phone2. Powercycle your phone by powering off and powering on.3. Open Apple Music and play any downloaded song.

Watch and listen as the audio magically transfers from your phone to your car audio.Tip: If you’re Spotify user, remember to follow the same procedures by starting up the Music app first.

Hello guysOnly just joined but I have recently bought a Q5 and am finding little help with a Google search so thought I would ask the question.Is the arm rest supposed to make a loud clunky sound as being lifted? Mine almost sounds broke as if something has come loose within the arm rest. And sometimes seems to make a noise when turning at speed etc.any help appreciated
"Yes it should as the armrest is on a ratchet. If you lift it fully then it will go down to the lowest position. As you raise the armrest from the lowest position you will hear a click as it goes past each locking position. As regards the other issue, never heard of it before."
I thought that would be the case. However it sounds very clunky. I had an A3 before this and the arm rest ran on a similar mechanism but sounded a lot quieter. Strange one
"I have same problem with my Q5, strange noise coming from the central tunnel armrest area. This drive me crazy. Did you manage to solve this issue???"
Hi. The clunking noise was the arm rest jamming on the back fans which were not sat correctly in the central reservation. And the other noise turned out to be something/ money stick under the cup holders. The plastic supports in the cup holders had pushed out and left slots for coins to fall in and sit in under the holders and roll about. Really awkward.

Doesn't it come with a pump as std?
Thanks for the replies. Just bagged one for £100 inc delivery on ebay.
Are you sure that's the correct one? Going rate for the 195/75/18 collapsible spares are £200-£300.I was quoted over double that from the dealer. They ain't cheap!
"Having just used the space saver when I got a puncture on a brand new 20"" tyre I have to say its an excellent bit of kit.You get a foot pump to blow it up and there was no way I was doing that. Called the RAC out for a man with a trolley jack and a compressor."
Good idea Chopper with RAC and a proper compressor. Later Q5's come with a small compressor located in the left hand side cover of the boot. It's used for both the gunk kit and/or a spacesaver if supplied. I gather it takes an age to actually inflate the collapsible spare.
You would think there would be an compressed air cylinder available like the ones that repair and inflate the tyre but without the gunk.

"I did try to rotate tyres, but gave up when I found the wheels were stuck to the hubs.I have decided tyre rotation is really not worth the effort and run the tyres until they need replacement front / back."
"Old_Geezer said:A straight forward question on whether to carry out tyre/wheel rotation directly from front to rear after a given mileage.As most drivers will know, if carried out quite frequently tyre/wheel rotation will even out tyre wear and make the set last longer, thus allowing all 4 tyres to be changed at the same time.I came from many years of BMW with staggered set up and rear wheel drive only, and also cars with permanent 4 wheel drive (BMW x Drive), so it did not make sense to rotate and was not advocated in the user manuals.I am now running a 2017 Q5 2.0 TFSI S Line with the latest Quattro Ultra transmission that disengages the rear wheel drive transmission when cruising along, and it could be that there may well be more tread remaining on the rear tyres if they are not rotated directly from front to rear after many milesI have looked in the latest manual and it gives no help on this subject because theQuattro Ultra 4 wheel drive systemis new to the Q5.This is a question to the latest MK2 Q5 drivers! Have you changed tyres over (directly from front to back) or are you considering changing over in the near future? If so at what mileage.Note 1. I do realise that the front tyres do wear slightly different due to steering geometry and I can see there is a difference at 5000 miles. This could be the time for the first rotation.Note 2. If you do respond even saying you are not going to rotate, please add your currently mileage.Click to expand...I was debating it but hadnt reached a decision when at 8k miles I noticed a tear in tyre sidewall (probably from a pothole...)That meant two new tyres so rotated at that point as it was rear that was damaged, so two new on front and old fronts on rear.Now on 13k miles and havent checked them recently as been away but last time i looked they all looked good for a while yet. And they are they infamously soft Pirelli P Zero in 21"" size..."
"Just keep an eye on them. My SQ5 looks fairly even at 15K, my A4 quattro is the same but my Golf was heavier on the front. If the fronts are wearing visibly more I'd rotate them. Always prefer a set of 4 at renewal."
"Agree with the wear on the Golf. I have had 6, yes six from new over the years and they always wore away the fronts earlier because of the heavier front end. In fact so did the Audi A3 2.0 litre Tdi in 2003. I would hope the G5 might give more even wear because I can see Audi have made an effort to get somewhere like a 50/50 weight distribution with the battery in the boot."
"I like to swap my tyres round to ensure even wear, I notice when my first service was due ( after a year, 8000 miles) that the front had worn a bit more than the rear, as I would expect as the car is predominantly front wheel drive. I ask my very helpful dealership Five Oaks Audi to swap the around which they did free of charge when the car was serviced. Another reason I do this is if not swapped the fronts will wear out first and when replacing a pair of tyres it is recommended the new tyres go on the rear of the vehicle, something the tyre fitters do not do as a matter of course, or grudgingly if requested."
"Always have rotated tyres at the 6 monthly/10,000 km mark. Come replacement time I prefer to swap 4 over than 2 and risk off match.My current vehicle is a Q3 and while getting a value for trade in last week the dealer commented if the tyres were replaced or original, stating they were original and I am anal on rotation and pressure monitoring, they were surprised I was able to get so many kms from them."

"Sorry Old-Geezer, I intended to put that in my post, it's 10,000 miles."
No problem. So rotating them now is not a bad decision.
"I rotated my tyres so that all four needed to be replaced at the same time. But this time around I won't be doing this, as I would prefer to only have to buy 2 tyres at a time and also you have at minimum 2 tyres that have good amount of tread on them. Which is safer."

"""it is recommended the new tyres go on the rear of the vehicle"", this statement is outdated and relates to when there was no ABS, ASR and traction control. Its purpose was to stop the rear wheels loosing grip before the fronts and causing the car to spin. The car electronics prevent this from happening so best to have the good tyres on you steering wheels which is also the wheels that most braking takes place.I don't bother changing the tyres around. I prefer to monitor the wear pattern so I can assess and correct any miss-alignment if needed."
"I was told by a salesman that they need at least 4mm to be put on the forecourt, but your guess is as good as mine as to what they actually do."
I was told the same and if you read AUdi Approved literature it says as such...But if you can get away with not doing...
Spoke to the chap at the local mot station about rotating the wheels.he said he’s not sure he can do that because the wheels are coded to the corner of the Audi.could cause problems with the presure sensors. I have a 2019 q5 sline.anyone know if he’s right?
Welcome to our forum.
"Hi,That doesn’t sound correct. I have had plenty of cars with TPMS and have rotated the wheels once a year when changing from winter wheels to summer. The sensors automatically connect with the car regardless of which axel they are on."
Over four decades Audi have had a number of four wheel drive systems. The haldex is only active when slip is detected so almost all the time the car is front wheel drive only. In reality tyre wear is almost totally dependant on how you drive the car. With haldex I would wait until the rear tyre tread depth is about 4mm then rotate the wheels/tyres. Doing nothing affects the handling of the car as you will end up with minimal tread on the front and significantly more on the rear. I would strongly recommend that tyres on the same axle are replaced at the same time and if possible with the same tread pattern as the other axle.

Audi Insurance. Good tip thank you.

Yeah think you are probably right. Frome their website:

I was told Audi Aberdeen (aka John Clark) is not a repair centre approved by them.They will tell you their repair centres are carefully chosen. I suspect has more to do with the commission they pay (?)I guess most will know you do not have to use the centre nominated by your insurer and can choose a centre of your choice.

Does anyone know what the issue is when you hear a loud tapping or pinging during quick acceleration from 0-35 or 40 to 65 or 70. After you reach the desired speed the tapping goes away. It only is upon quick acceleration.
In a four stroke engine the sound described would appear to be 'pinking'. Look it up. Usually occurs if the ignition timing is wrong or fuel of poor quality.
I will have the ignition timing checked and maybe try a different Premium gas brand. Thanks for your comment Richard.

"Hi,What do you mean, “Light comes and goes”? Are you experiencing a fault with your Auto high beam function?"
Yes. Sometimes on. Sometimes off. Switch always on Auto
"And it goes on and off whilst your driving? The reason I ask is because every time you restart the car, it resets to “off”."
So to be on must put the auto switch off than on for the light to come on?
I would guess that with the auto function on the main beam indicator light on the dash will illuminate when the main beam lights are operative and the light will go off when the car cuts to dipped beams. There is no indicator light on the dash (in my car at least) for dipped beams only for main beams.

"For the 55 tfsi e Audi recommend 95 RON. If you put in 98/99 RON the performance difference will be negligible. So, when my Q5 gets here it will be fuelled at my local Asda or Morrisons, which is currently cheaper at 155.9 per litre."

"Has anyone else been ripped off regarding a leaking thermostat housing gasket? I own a 2018 Q5 Prestige. Last week, during my 60,000 mile service, my Audi dealership told me my thermostat housing gasket was leaking and it would cost $1,375 + tax to replace! When I asked why it cost so much for a simple gasket, they said they have to replace the complete water pump/thermostat housing unit to replace a new gasket! Really?"

That is rubbish. The gasket can be replaced without replacing the water pump. With your age of car I would go to an indie.

I also think the S-Line looks a lot nicer with the honeycomb grill and the whole front just looks a bit cooler.I have the 10 speaker ""Audi sound system"" which is ok, but coming from a car with DynAudio, it was a bit of a step down. So if you can get the B&O system then I'd go for that. Otherwise I think that accessories etc are a very personal taste and choice.Your assumption about there being a hybrid version is correct, the 55 TFSIe. Don't expect more than about 23 miles on the battery, so if you're mainly doing short journeys then it's a good choice. Otherwise the 262 bhp petrol engine will be quite thirsty. And yes, it's a bit faster when you have both electric and petrol powertrains combined (so enjoy those first 23 miles).All info regarding models, prices, and consumption can be found here:Build your own > 2022 Q5 > 2022 > Q5 [REDIRECT] > Audi | Luxury sedans, SUVs, convertibles, electric vehicles & moreClick to expand...Thank you for your reply!

Is the increase in performance only available for the first 23 miles? After that, the vehicle is nofaster than the standard vehicle?"

"I have a 2021 Audi Q5 45 TFSI quattro and over the weekend, my windshield got hit by a stone and cracked. I'm looking to replace it, however I was wondering how the Q5 is able to detect when it rains and turns on the wiper...what is controlling this and would replacing the windshield impact this feature? Last but not least, my Audi dealer told me that my car will need to be re-calibrated since the camera behind the windshield will be impacted by the new windshield. Has anyone with a recent year model replaced their windshield and deal with all the sensors on the vehicle?-Glenn"
Welcome to our forumYou can see a little square sensor if you look through the windscreen at the rear mirror assembly.No idea why it would need recalibrated if screen is like for like OEM.
Welcome to the forumIf the sensor gel film has not been replaced (especially if the car has a had a new windscreen) this will affect the overall functioning of the sensor.
"I've had two screens replaced on my previous Tiguan 2018. And on both occasions the front camera, which sits behind the rear view mirror where the rain sensor is situated too, has had to be calibrated. I believe it's always done regardless of whether the screen is like-for-like."
"No one raised the issue of the 'sensor gel' before: so a third party (non-Audi) will of course not replace this. So this means, it will need to be done by an Audi dealer?"
"Sorry, I have no idea what sensor gel is.Be worth checking if your insurance covers windscreen replacement."
"That was the first part I checked and that is confirmed: they pushed me towards third party windshield replacement, but I'm concerned that some features (rain sensor and camera sensor) will not be addressed. I was at the Audi dealer over the weekend and nothing was mentioned about the 'sensor gel' either."
It is better to get the screen replaced with an Audi one as then all the sensors etc will work correctly. I think Audi will recalibrate everything just to be safe.
"Well I was surprised when I spoke with my dealer that they mentioned they would do the calibration, but the actual window replacement would be done with another party (so not the dealer itself)."
"I received the following quote from Audi dealer for the work:The glass is $2,064.80Installation $500Calibration for lane departure and active cruise control $580That brings the windshield replacement to $3,145: 2K for the windshield alone is pretty steep if you ask me."
Normally windscreen replacement is covered by insurance in UK. Is this not the case in the US?
"I have never had a screen replaced by the main dealer, always via a windscreen specialist. They always use original parts and recalibrate everything. My deductible is around £200 with insurance company."
"Insurance covers the windshield, but I wonder if they will have a bone with me when the difference between dealer and third party is 2K or more?"

Hi I wanted to know if tinting the windshield will alter either the Heads Up display or any of the Sensing safety Tech on the car? I usually get my windshield tinted but have not had all the sensing tech on my cars previously when doing it. Anyone have any information and experience on this in their car?
"I am sure it will be OK. When you retrofit they would apply tint film around, i.e. not under the sensor. Head up display shines onto the windscreen. I would ask your tint fitter to confirm."
I had my 2021 Audi Q5 tinted with this company:They did a great job and the tinting keeps the heat out (important in sunny Florida).

The Audi dealership is not nearby, so I was wondering if anybody had any pictures of the rear seats folded, so that I can see how much of an angle is created? I looked at the Infiniti Q5 and there was a substantial incline, when the seats were folded. I actually put a dog crate in the car and there's no way that it would have been stable."
"I don't know if this helps but I currently have a Q3 and I put a large dog cage in the back without folding down the rear seats. However, I do have to slide the rear seats forward to clear the glass on the tailgate."
Hello!I am getting ready to purchase a used 2019 Q5. It has 30k miles and is equipped with Continental Cross contact LX Sport tires 235/55/19. I live in the Northeast and am looking for a good all season tire..particularly decent in snow. These tires got terrible ratings regarding poor performance in snow..and many people stated that they wear fast. Any recommendations on what tires I should replace these with?
"I had Nokian all weather tyres which were very good in all weather conditions. However, on motorways, they were noisier than the previous Hankooks."
"Hi Guys, i have a 2015 sq5 with a set of 21"" wheels and looking to replace the tyres with Audi recommended tyres. I believe the appropriate options for this car is Continental sport contact 6 tyres , pirelli PZ or dunlop Sport Maxx GTs. Could anyone advise what's the most appropriate/best tyre for my car? Im looking for something with good wear.."
"Sadly, the best wear tyres are Michelin and they are not on your list. From experience of all the makes on your list I would go for Pirelli as the best wearing tyres. However, you have an SQ5, this is not synonymous with longevity of tyres."
"As far as i know the michelin tyres aren't approved for audi, cost considerably more and i was told i would be weeks waiting for em."
For some Audi's Michelin are approved. The only difference between an Audi approved and non-approved tyre is that the Audi one has an A0 on the wall. Over 38 years of owning Audi's I have never replaced the originals with Audi approved and I have had no problems. Bearing in mind your purchasing parameters then Pirelli is your only choice for extended life.
"I suppose the only reason i said it is cause im going to be buying em from audi and want to make sure they are approved and covered by their tyre warranty.I have always really liked the michelins, dont get me wrong...its the long wait time and higher cost putting me off them"
"Hi, I have just got a 2011 S Line 3.0 TDI,...... Can anybody recommend a decent boot tidy for it."
HiMy Q5 will be 3 years old on 29th March. I presume I will then have to pay for a new MMI subscription. I've not had any contact from Audi about it though I have booked in for an MOT on 20th so I hope I'll be able to sort things out then. Can anyone give me an idea of cost? I presume it's an annual cost? What exactly do I lose of I don't renew? And can I renew just some of the bits that I actually use?Thanks in advance
I think you mean Audi connect? See hereFAQS How do I renew my Connect licence? > FAQs > Audi Connect > Audi UK.Which of those features do you use?
Thanks for your reply. To be honest I am 100% confident that I barely use anything because I actually have no idea what it can actually do. I use the satnav (traffic) and the app to send destinations to the car. Plus I like the fact I could find it if it was stolen and I have occasionally used the lock feature or at least checked on the app that it was locked when I couldn't remember if I had locked it. Apart from that I don't think I use anything else!
If you click on my link it will show you what other features you may like to use.When in for MOT ask your friendly Audi dealer for a demo
When my previous 2016 Q5 reached it's 3rd birthday - I expected things to stop working but nothing did - everything carried on as normal - everything.(I sold it when it was 3yrs and 8mths old)
The app certainly says it all expires on 29 March. I might just let it lapse and see what I miss!

Welcome to the forumYou are always going to hear more from people that have problems or issues. Just like if you research some other brand of car. The Audi Q5 is a great SUV/car to own as it does pretty much everything most people need it to do. Had my SQ5 since 2015 and not had any issues with it. What other SUV's are you considering? There is so much choice these days!

Hi allI have a B8 2011 Q5 and I want to replace the grille with a full black honeycomb just wanted to know if all the B8 grills are the same like if I brought a A4 honeycomb grille would it fit as it seems so much easier the fit an A4 B8 grilleThanks dskSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
How do you set the maximum Q5 tfsi e charge to either 80% or 100% when using a home charger?
I bought a slightly used 2021 Q5 in June. The thing handles terribly in the snow. I was on snow packed roads and fishtailing like crazy. Didn't feel comfortable at 35 mph. I've seen a lot of good reviews for Continental Cross contact lx sport tires and I've seen a few bad. Any thoughts?
Welcome to the forum.If you need grip on snow you need a proper winter tyre
"The Haldex four wheel drive hardware used in the Q5 is, under normal circumstances, front wheel drive with rear wheel drive being activated when the front wheels slip. I have found that the best compromise in snow is to select the off-road mode using the Drive Select. The road holding is dependant on the type of snow. In the UK it is very wet so grip is poor. In Scandinavia it is dry which gives better grip. No summer tyres are good in snow. All weather are a compromise which work well with snow. Winter tyres are the best as they dig deeper in to the snow and the tread gets rid of the snow very well. The last point is that summer tyres with more than 6mm of tread will cope with snow with tactile handling but below this they will just float over the surface."
Thanks. I will be getting snow tires soon. Several locals have commented that the snow we've had this winter is different. They were having trouble also. We just put a new set of all season tires on kids Accord and it's handled weather this winter just fine.

I changed the drive settings but that didn't change handling in snow. Will be getting snow tires. I've never had a problem with all season tires on any vehicle I've owned until now. Some people feel the snow in Colorado has been different this year."
"I agree - I am seeing the same thing. We are currently driving our 3rd Q5 - a 2021 and I am surprised that it fishtails dangerously all over the road if there is any snow. The previous Q5's I owned were great in any kind of weather, but this version is alarmingly worse. I have tried it with the stability control on and off, but do not notice much difference. I am forced to drive at 25 mph with Audi Quatro, while any front wheel drive vehicle blows by me going 50 mph with no slipping. We also own a 2015 VW Beetle and we take it out whenever there is a chance of snow instead of the Q5!"
I have had Audi's with quattro drive for almost 40 years. In the latter years I have found that the electronics is a hinder not a helper. I was taught many decades ago how to drive on ice and snow. Tactility and your bum are the answers. Use the pedals and steering gently and progressively and use your bum to sense any untoward car movements. It works. I have never needed either all weather or winter tyres but I have always made sure that I do have a reasonable amount of tread on my summer tyres when driving in snow.
I have appt. this week to get a set of Vredestein snow tires installed. Hopefully I won't have anymore problems.

Interesting device. Google Maps and my Dash Cam warn me of cameras.
"Not that I speed, just asking for a friendSome ,,,,, add spurious speed cameras to Google maps outside their homes e.g. on S Deeside Road. My dash cam gives many spurious alerts e.g. traffic lights. I can easily spot the fixed cameras, mobile are a bit more challenging to see in time to check my speedo."

"The website says 11,000,000 users across europe, how many of those are in the UK iI don’t know, however I just wanted something small and simple to alert me when i’m not 100% concentrating on my speed and so far it’s not missed a single static or average camera on my travels.21"
I have had a Snooper for many years. It works perfectly for all fixed site cameras and warns you if there has been a mobile camera site where you are. The main disadvantage is that you have to download the camera database by USB connecting it to a PC/laptop. I only ever do this when I am going on long journeys. The database download is free.
I have a Snooper Elite but the hassle of unplugging and taking it out of the car just became too much and it’s not the smallest unit and doesn’t stick very well to the windscreen always bloody falling off. They have just been bought out buy Road Angel and were offering discounts on the road angel pure for snooper owners. I do like this unit and it’s size works for me.
When (a fiend) had a snooper it was fitted behind the grill. Almost invisible to see and no need to remove

I bought the Over The Air updates too. And the Dynamic Motorway Speed Alerts too - they change instantly with the gantries.I love the Road Angel Pure.
Also - now doing 'Bus Lane Alerts' - to bus lanes with cameras for enforcement present.
"Warning light came on saying I have 600 miles left...I put 10 litres in, well probably 9 as spilt quite a bit...the light is still on?Thought it would be like topping up windscreen wash, is the sensor not as sensitive?...I just read there is a 25 litres capacity so it probably not even half full is that why the warning light is still on (mysteriously) saying still only 600 miles available?Is it like fuel, do you just keep adding it until it reaches the top?"
just fill it up
I filled mine up on Saturday but I’ve not been anywhere to see if the warning has now gone. I tipped it in until in overflowed. Every car I’ve had usually uses about 1 litre every 650 miles.
"Ahh the warning light disappeared on the drive to work this morning, but I got a free £10 voucher from Halfords so have ordered another 10 litres to fill it up."
Good news
"Was out in the car today, my warning has stopped too. Should be good for another 5000 miles."
I just posted nearly same problem when I filled up the AdBlue (5 liter then full). But I still have orange on the motor symbol and in the app ” read manual” ??
"Anyone on here de chromed their q5? If so any recommendations who to do it and costs. I’m in Hertfordshire…. Had wheels refurbed and on the outer edge which are diamond cut, it has started to bubble underneath. This is the second time this has happened over the past few years and although they have agreed to re do, not sure whether to go for the Black edition look and have wheels all done in graphite? Any thoughts…."
"Nice, what is the colour name or code? Although I’m happy with existing, it does seem to be an issue that don’t want to go through again.Time for a change…. (Sorry for posting pic twice?…)"
"Hi,Your car looks nice.My wheel colour is VW Diamond Chrome. It looks even better IRLDiamond cut wheels are great when new, but after recut the clear coat rarely lasts more than 6 months.Another option which I have seen is to have your wheels two tone. Gloss black with silver where the diamond cut should be."
I would just go for a single colour over the the whole alloy wheel including the diamond cut area. This is what I plan to do next time - it will last much longer!
I know someone who had their Q3 dechromed. The parts are readily available but the difficult bit was replacing the window surrounds which requires patience. The final result is amazing.
"Another couple of questions.Should I get all chrome parts wrapped?I have also seen Honeycomb grills, which look really smart. What models (8R) have these as standard, never understood why they do the light surround in Honeycomb but not the grill in the first place?I've seen youtube threads re replacing the grill but seems to be a real faff, removing bumper etc or is it a 1 hour job for someone who knows what they are doing?"
You can buy the front honeycomb grill with a black surround. If you get one that has a silver surround I would just vinyl wrap it in gloss black. Have a look at this video on how do do it:
"That looks really nice, but it looks like a lot of work. Be interested to hear from anyone brave enough to try"
"Hi,I have just purchased a Saphe Drive Mini - it seems like a great bit of kit and apparently the alerts should be played through the car speakers.I have my iPhone 12 connected via bluetooth to the MMI and I am able to make and recieve phone calls (so I know there is a good connections) however no alerts are played from the Saphe?Am I missing something here or do I have to connect my phone with a USB cable to get these sounds to play via CarPlay?I really dont like CarPlayso want to avoid this route if at all possible!!ThanksP"
"If you have saphe connected to the app on your phone does it show alerts on your phone? Then check app and permissions. I recall my Google maps trying to use Bluetooth to give directions, didn't work. Told app to use phone speaker, worked."
"In the UK for Q5's with diesel engines, according to the Build Your Audi configurator, there is an option for a 70 litre fuel tank and 24 litre AdBlue tank for £100, instead of the standard 65 litre tank (unable to find size of standard AdBlue tank).What size is the standard AdBlue tank?What impact, if any, does the fitment of this option have on the vehicle (such as reduced boot space etc)?If the impact is zero or minimum why is not a standard fit?"
"Hi,I have that option, although I don’t officially know what size standard is. I did a quick search on this site and found this (amongst others), which might help. I understand that it might be 13ltrs.Adblue tank capacityThe extra fuel tank capacity I like though.edit: just read the “standard equipment” on the configurator and saw that it is 12ltrs."
Hmm.. did they reduce the standard fuel tank capacity on mk2 Q5?Mine is 75 liters and no AdBlue!
"Good evening, I have an Adblu issue. After 2 years being a proud Q5 owner and extremely loyal client of Audi South Africa, I now sit with an Audi with full service history at the dealership, but giving me a Engine alert and that saying the vehicle will not restart after 850 km. According to the dealership, it is a module fault and must be imported at a cost of over R 20 000. Is this possible?The Q5 is out of warranty and this seems rather absurd. Any advice please?"
Welcome to our forum
Welcome to the forumMost likely a Nox sensor problem. You can try to pull the sensor and clean. If you have VCDS / Vag-com etc you can csan for error codes for more info. You can also use VCDS to try a forced regen.The stealership will try to charge you £900+ for the part plus labour. You can order online a genuine sensor for £100-400.
Welcome. A fault code reading would assist...
I ordered a Q5 in October 2021 for estimated delivery May 2022. This configuration as standard came with a surround camera. Now I find that the Q5 Audi configurator only has a reversing camera. Can I assume that I will get the surround camera as ordered?
"I doubt it, best to check with dealer, he MIGHT know"
Check with dealer.
I have asked my dealer and you get what you ordered unless Audi issue an edict stating that they are discontinuing a feature.
"Make sure you have the order specification list when you go pick your car up, and check everything on list is on the car before you sign. If anything is missing or not as expected you have more negotiating power before you have signed off, then after you have pickup the car. i.e the dealer will be more willing to fix any issues."
Thank you Zig. A superb detailed explanation. If only Audi were that good. The latest news on my Q5 is that the spec will not change but the build week has now been moved from 10 to 12. I have asked for further discount!
The latest information is that I should get my Q5 sometime in June. I was concerned that the equity in my trade in Q3 would reduce. I received an email from my dealer stating that the Q3 equity will not change from the original valuation in October 2021 no matter how much mileage I do. Now I wait for the next event.
Good to know
"Hi guys,We are looking into getting a dog for the first time and therefore I have been looking at the Audi OEM dog guard. My question is can it be used at the same time as the luggage pull out cover that is already in place or does that need to be removed and the dog guard fitted.Im assuming it cant be used at the same time. Was hoping there was anyone who had it that could confirm ?Thanks"
Not sure why you would want to use both at the same time? Your dog is going to chew the cover to bits...
sorry no i meant for example overnight use not whilst dog was in the car. I hear its a quick smile removal but was hoping I could just leave it in and then take the cover on and off as required
"Not sure about the full height dog guard, but if you get one that that just fills the void between the top of the seats and the roof lining, it looks like you can use the pull cover at the same time. I would check how much of a gap there is currently between your pull cover and seats and maybe the mounting positions for the guard? Or hopefully someone with a dog will confirm."
"Hi Guys,One of my 20"", 5 segement spoke, contrasting grey, diamond cut alloys looks to have corrosion setting in under the laquer on the silver alloy area. It's in and around the centre cap area.Does anyone have a recommendation for a company in South West London area?Also anyone have a rough idea of the cost to refurb. I'm guessing this is a fairly labour intensive job and so not something that can be done mobile at house and would need to leave the car with them?Thanks for your help."
"Sorry cant recommend any companies as I don't live near London. However I would expect around about £75-100 for single diamond cut alloy wheel. It normally works out a bit cheaper per wheel if doing all 4 wheels. Although don't expect a refurbished diamond cut wheel to last, I don't think they are as good as OEM factory produced diamond cut wheels. Most places will only offer a 6 or 12 month guarantee on the finish of the Diamond Cut wheel - check their T&C's!"
Welcome to our forum
Thanks for the reply and info. I do want to replace all 4 to just a gunmetal grey butthe other 3 are in perfect condition. Perhaps Ill get this one diamond cut refurbed then wait for 2 or more to fail and then replace all 4 for standard finish
"I'm planning to get mine refurbed again eventually without diamond cut finish next time. Think they will be more durable against winter salt etc, and last longer. This is what I had done last time OEM gunmetal to black inners with diamond cut.SQ5 21"" Black Optics Alloy WheelsThinking of doing all in a black or dark grey / anthracite etc with no diamond cut, still not sure if satin or gloss is best for easy cleaning / hiding light grime/dust."
"I agree re being more durable. The wheels on my smax I had done in matte anthracite and whilst they looked good, now seeing the anthracite gloss on my current q5 wheels I will at some stage go for gloss finish."
Hi All!I am currently looking for a used Q5 and have done quite a bit of research. I see that it was redesigned in 2018. When looking at Consumer Reports the 2018 got average predicted reliability whereas the 2019 received an above average rating in this category. This is steering me towards a 2019 even though the 2018s are much more in my price range and there seems to be more out there. Can anyone give feedback on these years and why one may have rated higher than the other??
Welcome to our forum
Welcome to the forumAre you one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?I would say the new model is reported as higher reliability because basically its newer. Newer cars are less likely to have issues. Give it another year or two and the 2019 model might average out a bit on reliability. Also the engine and tech in the 2019 model is newer and should have resolved past issues that may have affected past reliability etc.

"Just started year 5 of owning my Q5. When Audi Connect expired in the last 3 years I just contacted Audi customer service by email and they extended it each year for free.I was advised in September 2020 that the licence was extended until 1.12.2022. I.e over 2 years.However the MMI informed me a couple of days ago the Connect licence has expired? and so I emailed Audi Customer Service as before to find out what was the problem.I was advised by customer service that the renewal system has now changed to using ‘My Audi‘ web site. On logging on I had to choose between a monthly renewal for £14.50 or an annual charge of £141.I have informed them of my disgust on rescinding a previously advised free licence for this year.So beware, previously free Connect renewals are now going to be £141 per annum."

"Hello, I have a 2016 Audi Q5 and recently added a towbar. The fitter was v reputable, and all wired into the main harness etc with the car knowing the towbar and electrics are in place. However, there is a small issue in that the sensor to the immediate right of the tow bar is picking it up and nearly constantly beeping. I had the sensors swapped around to check the sensor wasnt at fault, however the fault carried so no hardware issue.Does anyone know of a fix?Thanks"
I would go back to that reputable fitter
That's what I was thinking.

Good wet weather performance is my preferred option
"I am leaning toward Avon ZX7. I have fitted before. They get good reviews other Q5 owners particularly quiet and good for wet weather but do not wear well, @ £136 per corner the price is right."

Not sure where/how best to dispose of it so I thought I would ask my fellow forum members what you think? Any input or help is most appreciated."
I would advertise in the usual places for spares or repair.
Usual places Missile?thanks for the response.
Scrapyard. Vehicle dismantlers. EBay (for sale spares or repair).

So anyone local to Herts who can recommend anyone who can supply or supply and fit?"
You could just wrap it in vinyl or get one of the stick on covers on Amazon or eBay. Some of these trims are a right pig to remove!
"Yep Ive seen the youtube vid. I've looked everywhere and cannot find trim add on. Not sure if it would look right, anyone bought one that they are happy with? I've spoken to Wrapper, and they said they cannot gtee that the film would not sink into dents, again anyone tried this?"
I suspect the wrap would follow the contours and might look much worse

HiI have a 2017 Mk2 Q5 and have noticed that the chrome window trim on the drivers door is slightly loose at the rear of the door. It's not in danger of falling off but I wondered if it was a simple job to get it properly fitted.I've seen some videos saying it simply pops up and off. Others saying you need to remove the inner door card.Anyone have any ideas?

Welcome to our forumHave you been using harsh chemicals?
"The front grill is plastic and it has been silvered, not painted. This definitely looks like a chemical attack."
No I do not use harsh chemicals I have ceramic-coating on the Audi Q5.
"I have a 2012 Q5 s line and the exact same thing happened to my grill, it started probably like 4 years ago when I first noticed and gradually got worse. I’ve been told many things about it, but what I think it’s from is water damage. At first I thought it was from sun or heat damage, but my repair shop said water, and I have noticed it get worse after rain. That being said, still not totally sure except that it’s only plastic coated with some chrome."
Yes I do agree with that it could have been rain that did it I didn't take notice of it before but it did now and I just gotta washed and cleaned and ceramic coated so I guess I'm just had to replace the whole grill!
Over here we could get the grill re-silvered. I think this would be cheaper than a new grill.
"HiI'm new to my Q5...I've only had it a couple of weeks...but I'm not new to Audi or DSG.I noticed yesterday, that I can switch from reverse to drive and vice versa without pressing the brake pedal. I was a bit surprised and wondered if this is a normal thing?I also noticed that my handbrake can be applied while I'm moving.....I in slow traffic doing around 4mph and pulled the button expecting nothing to happen but it locked the rear wheels and applied the hgandbrake. No harm done, but another surprise. Is this normal?"
I would not recommend you continue to do this! Especially the changing gear part. I always make a point of bringing the car to a complete stop when ever changing from drive to reverse or vice versa.
"I found out about changing gear while stationary in my drive....I've never done it while moving, nor would I attempt it.It just struck me as weird...I'm sure my A6 couldn't change from drive to reverse without the brake pedal being pressed."
Well I occasionally change from drive to neutral if coasting down a long motorway hill etc for extra MPG when I'm driving miss daisy. Obviously you can't use the brake to changeno issues ever!
Mine has intelligent coasting but I disabled it.
Both features are normal
On the bottom of the undercarriage there is a fibre like shield a small section on right side has broken off perhaps from road damage or in transit from factory to dealer. Dealer said replacement was $150 plus labor and I wonder what this shield actually does since it seems rather flimsy & not mounted securely ?
I believe it's function is to prevent debris being thrown up and into and collecting in the void under the wing (fender)
Also reduces road noise into the cabin.
Also helps aerodynamics.
Is there a forum thread about this?
There is on the Q3 site as they keep on falling off. The resolution is penny washers.
2017 S line. Driving today and all of a sudden all dash warnings came on one by one. Still driving ok but lit up like a Christmas tree. Anybody had the same happen..any ideas?Booked into VAG specialist on Monday.CheersSimon
"Too vague to comment. I would check what warnings are ON against your manual, then decide if its OK to continue driving."
Do they come on all the time. If you restart the car do they go off. You said all warnings come on. Are there any that don't come on? Sounds like it is a failure of the CAN bus but the right diagnostic tools will isolate the problem
"Sorry, can't be any less vague than ""all dash warnings came on"" as All dash warnings came on... I was really only asking if anyone has had similar happen and what the outcome was.I've had the diagnosis now anyway and the front o/s abs sensor is logged in diagnostics and battery showing up as needing replaced. It would seem when cranking over, volts are dropping to 9v and coupled with sensor fault, the electronics throw a tantrum. Warnings did go on and off every other day.Booked in to get both replaced on Friday."
I am pleased to hear that it has been diagnosed. This is not the first time I have heard that a battery needs replacing.
Low battery can cause all manner of warning lights ot come on.

"Hello all, the odometer button to reset mileage has snapped on my 2016 Q5, any ideas where i could get one, done a bit of research and it appears i may have to buy a complete instrument cluster is this true, thanks in advance."
Welcome to the forum. Probably need to get a new cluster unfortunately. How did you manage to break it?
"Only just bought it & and didn't notice it was broken until i got home, i thought there's no way it'll be covered on warranty, but thankfully garage has said they'll sort it so problem solved, cheers."
Good result!
"I have previously owned an SQ5 (2014 Reg), and I could change the Exhaust sound to make it sound louder or quieter.I also fitted a Kufatec Sound Booster and although I appreciate it’s not everyones taste, I personally liked the louder sound.My son-in-law has just bought an SQ5 (2015 Reg) and it doesn’t appear to have the option to change the Exhaust sound.My query is - are all SQ5’s fitted with the option to change the Exhaust sound Or not?Looking at the Exhaust, both sides have a circular box that branches off close to the tail-pipes… I cannot however see any flaps within the tail-pipes… does this mean the Exhaust sound can’t be changed.Grateful for any help you can offer on this."
Exhaust sound increases in Sport mode or you can choose it as loud on individual mode ........... or at least that is how it works on my SQ5
"Needs to have Audi Drive Select to be able to change the exhaust noise without putting the car into S modeDrive Select was a paid for option on the SQ5 until 2016 ish, so if the original owner didn’t tick the box then car wont have the ability to do it"
You can easily retrofit Audi Drive Select. If you search you should find posts explaining how
"Thanks for your replies, I will look into retrofit option, Cheers."
"You cannot have louder exhaust in efficiency mode. Select individual and then option to select loud exhaust.Do you hear louder exhaust when in sport mode? If not, there may be an issue with the speakers."
"Has anyone either fitted or had fitted, front and rear cameras? I'm in two minds whether to go for it or not, being very conscious of disturbing trim and it possibly not going back as snuggly as it is just now. Is it worth the risk or even the outlay?"
I have fitted front using next base hard wire kit. Wire easy to push behind trim without having to remove any. Right hand fuse cover pops off and then locate relevant switched supply.
"I invested in Thinkware front and rear cameras. I bought from RAC including fitting at home. Great video in poor light and excellent parking mode feature. Paid for itself when a dippy ""lady"" drove into my car and fled the scene."
"Thanks I'll check that out, I have seen a video of installation and I would hate to damage the trim or for it to not go back as it should"
Is there a hole in the bulkhead to get the cable through?
"I have DIY fitted before. Front is easy peasy, but rear is a hassle. This is the camera I boughtThinkware F800 Pro Dash Cam Hardwire | RAC ShopRAC contracted fitting to an installer who did a first class job. No wires can be seen."
"Whatever a pillar you come down the wire can be tucked behind using a flat screwdriver, then along a short edge of the dash into the fuse panel. No need to go through the bulkhead."
I've fitted the Blackvue DR650-GW Front and Rear - powered from diagnostics port. Looks brilliant and you can hardly see any wiring.
"I’ve fitted Blackvue front and rear in both my Q5s, hard wired to the fuse box and the rear camera cable i routed through the headlining 2 minute job to route far better than running it through the car at floor level21"
I chose Thinkware front and rear.
I had an Audi UTR front/rear retro-fitted to my Q3. To do this required 8 hours of Audi dealer labour. The result was superb.
"""8 hours of Audi dealer labour"" you were done up like a kipper."
"No I wasn't. I know the sales and service managers and they did a package deal for me, front and rear cameras plus installation all in for £550 incl VAT."
"Something does not add up with your story. The Audi UTR camera lists at £425 plus 8 hours labour, all for £550. I will believe it when you post a copy of the invoiceIn any event. There is NO WAY it should take 8 hours to install. Any competent DIY could do it in less than 2.As long as you are happy"
"As regards price, It is not what you know but who you know. I agree with your time frame but I wanted it done right and warrantied. Bear in mind that I have purchased most of my Audi's from them over the last 37 years of solid Audi ownership. Loyalty does count."
It was only the time frame to fit I was questioning.
As@missilesaid - for £550 - you were done up like a kipper.Mine (BlackView with F&R WiFi / Live-View / Cloud / GPS) cost me less than half that and took about 30 mins.
That's a really low price. I thought my deal for an Audi UTR + labour all in at £550 was good.
"To be fair you did get the 'genuine article' for that, and as we know nothing with an Audi badge on it comes cheap.Whilst my wiring is almost totally out of view - I'd imagine yours is even better and more discreet if fitted by Audi."
"I fitted blackvue DR750s in my latest Q5 on a 66 plate, hard wired into the drivers side fuse box and the only wires visible are an inch at the front and rear where the cable goes into the headlining at the front and hatchback trim at the rear, took about 2 hours in total and cost £219 from the blackvue outlet.21"
"Has anyone either fitted or had fitted, front and rear cameras? I'm in two minds whether to go for it or not, being very conscious of disturbing trim and it possibly not going back as snuggly as it is just now. Is it worth the risk or even the outlay?"
As I always purchase my Audi's new with a 5 year warranty I have concerns about fitting a non-Audi accessory which is semi integrated into the vehicle. If there is an issue then I only need to contact the dealer.
I have always found my Audis to be reliable. Have you made many claims?
In 38 years of Audi ownership I have never made a warranty claim but there could be a first time.
I guess you are paying for peace of mind.
Looking at my 2021 TFSI e edition 1 the gap between the top of the tyre and wheel arch seems quite large. Is this correct. It is not air suspension.
What do you mean by large? Can you please measure from the top of each tyre to the wheel arch.
Why not visit your dealer and compare with a.n.other similar car
"Can anyone recommend a company that can repair or replace, as mine does not work. Have read threads re purchasing new speakers, cutting open and replacing, but just need a recommendation. I am in Hertfordshire but willing to travel if it can be done while i wait as 2hrs has been mentioned.."
"There is no dedicated company that replaces or repairs these in the UK (as far as I'm aware) except in Germany (find them on eBay etc, £278.19per side, and you have to cut them off and post them! Plus you probably don't know which one is faulty or if they both are). Therefore your options are, contact the engineer in the sound actuator thread, or find a local mechanic willing to do it for you (this is what I did), or lastly just take it to an Audi dealer for replacement (most expensive option at about £580 per side (not including labour)). Alternatively if you have the tools (angle grinder, welder, soldering iron etc) you could do it yourself."
I've actually found someone in Rugby who can do the job. I've bought a couple of pioneer TSMR 1640 marine speakers and hopefully running it up there next week. Vagtech have checked all the wiring and said it ok so should be a staright swap. Will keep you posted...
Good news. How much?
"60.00 for speakers and quoted 150 for both sides, if all works out, Bargain!!"
Good jobMake sure they keep the casing cool when welding so as not to harm the new speakers inside
That sure is a bargain
I am after a centre air vent but everyone for sale on ebay is for a left hand drive car. Without paying audi prices has anyone got any good contacts re replacement?

I have been speaking to a friend of mine who works at Audi in Ingolstadt. Two weeks ago all Audi production lines were told to give preference to hybrid and EV vehicles. For petrol/diesel Audi's this could mean extended lead times.
"To be expected I guess as they transition over to 100% electric in the years ahead. But as I'm not buying either any time soon, I'm not really bothered"
Ver nice! Pick mine up in 3 days
Welcome to our forum
I love it. So glad Audi finally put Black rings on it (I always have to add my own to my Black Editions).
I have just ordered one. Can you please tell me how long between ordering and pick up by you?
"Sorry, I forgot to ask, do you have the uprated EV battery?"
I was fortunate to find this new at Carlisle Audi. The ev range is 37 miles. I’ve only managed late 20’s. Probably due to short runs and colder weather. Very nice to drive and high quality vehicle.

"Hi everyone,As a newbie to the forum I wanted to first say hello to everyone,I have 12 month old SQ5 which I’m loving, however I haven’t yet seen the headlight washers activate. Having previously driven an A6 you could clearly see that when washing the windscreen the headlight washers activated - not all the time, but around 1 in 4. But for my Q5 I have never seen them work.Back to main dealer or am I missing something?"
"Welcome to our forumBefore going to dealer, I would suggest you activate screen wash then get out and see if headlights are wet"
"On my current Q3, soon to be Q5, the headlight washers only work every six uses of the screen washers but only when the lights are on."
On my 2015 SQ5 the headlight washers only activate when the headlights are on! Not sure if the same on yours or MK2 SQ5?
I believe as@mwcltdaluded to - they only fire up every 6th time you use the screen washer.
Welcome to our forumI am sure your local dealer will advise what parts you need
HiI have misplaced my manual and am looking to buy some oil as a spare for my garage.What do Audi UK recommend for the 2.0 TDI engine ?ThanksPeter
VW 507 00 which equates to Castrol Edge 5W-30 and Mobil 1 ESP Formula 5W-30. There may be others but I havn't found them.As a mater of interest how did you determine that you needed oil? Via the MMI display or a low oil warning light. I ask because I have been monitoring my oil level via the MMI for about 4 weeks and the readings have been as low as 1/4 but are now back to the max level!
not on the q5 the dipstick tube is capped off
"Thanks for reply .. I will pick some up from Halfords.I do not need any at moment but just want to stick a bottle in the boot ""just in case"".My MMI says its 3/4 full .. that swith 7000 miles done in 2 months.Peter"
"Not hanging back on the mileage then,lol.Youbetter order a new one now"
"The oil required also depends on if you are on the fixed service intervals, or the variable long life intervals..."
"Picked up my Q5 on Saturday and boy what a lot of reading !! Noticed I had a bottle of what I assumed was oil in the boot in a black bag. Did yours not come with one. Must admit so busy this weekend that I have not ""discovered"" everything apart from bonding using my Bluetooth and how the Sat Nav worked. Still working on the Parking Senosrs though. Dont seem to work the same as my VW unless there is ""yet another setting"" to find out !!"
Just came across this at Halfords:http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?mpe_id=62857&msg=&cm_cr=No+Campaign-_-Web+Activity-_-C918672-_-PRODHOME_ESPOTCAROUSEL-_-Castrol+Magnatec+5W30+Oil+4+Litre&catalogId=10151&productId=253905&evtype=CpgnClick&intv_id=37884&langId=-1&storeId=10001&ddkey=http:ClickInfo#tab2Castrol Magnatec 5W30 Oil 4 Litre...Sounds like a cracking deal. ut is this suitable for the 2.0 TDI Q5? It is not the 5W30 edge....Any ideas?
"hmmm..maybe not...it says ""For Ford cars"" on the tin...(if you zoom into the pic on the site, you should be able to read..)"
I have just purchased some oil and the 1 litre which came with my Q5 was the MOBIL 1 - 5W30 ESP Fully Synthetic.I looked at Halfords then found 5litres of the MOBIL 1 - 5W30 ESP Fully Synthetic for £37.99 oncamskill.co.uk... so I ordered 10litres.
1L came with the q5? Hmmm. How come?
"Not sure to be honest, though a few other comments on the forum sometime ago suggested some guys were getting through quite a bit of oil, though I have never experienced it myself.This is the first time in 30,000 miles I have needed to top up the oil.I have played safe and purchased from Camskill the same type that came direct from the factory with the car, though there maybe cheaper alternative brands."
Did you mean you had a 1L can of oil that came with the car? Sorry mate just checking to see if it is indeed hidden somewhere in the boot. I can't seem to find one.
Audi should give you 1L with a new car but not usually with a used one - its in a leather case to the right of the boot. It's very important to use the correct oil so this should be MOBIL 1 - 5W30 ESP Fully Synthetic which comes in a grey bottle with a green sticker and green cap.
"Thats correct, the car was new and came with 1litre of oil, located to the right hand side of the boot (under the 12v power socket) - though mine was not in a leather case. The bottle is exactly as described by Kramer."
Neither was mine. I want a leather case!
"You could have had mine before I sold it but left it in the car. My new A8 doesn't have one either, then again I wouldn't expect to have to put oil in that."
Hmmmmm cant find it on mine. Any secret chambers?
I bought a dipstick for my Q5 of eBay after getting mixed messages about oil level. Mine was saying overfill on mmi and low oil on Speedo clocks. I services it myself put 5 litres of Castrol in and everything was back to normal. So you can't trust either of the warning systems in Audis. After filling it up I used the dipstick to measure where the level was and I just use it for piece of mind. I don't trust these digital oil level readers.
"Just got a new to me Auto Q5 on a 66 plate with 40k had a manual for the last 5 years, i’m noticing when coming to a stop each and every time that i hear like a brake noise a loud creak is the best i can explain it as. Is this normal for an auto or possibly an issue of some kind.The car had new rear disks and pads and Front discs as part of the MOT at point of sale, the car drives fine and brakes well, just wondering what this is?Thanks 21"
"Only a guess: If it only hear it when braking to a stop, I would suggest the muppet who changed the brakes did not use copper slip on back of the pads."
Research audi q5 brake pedal noise. It happens too frequently.

Hey.I’m looking for some Running boards for my 2017/18 SQ5. I’d rather not pay a quoted price of £1024 from the Audi garage + a further £400 to fit so if anyone can recommend where I can get some from and maybe even a place to fit would be great…
"Hi all,Was looking for a bit of advice please. I've been looking at a Q5 for about 6 months now (I've currently got an A5 Black Edition) and finally took the plunge and put a deposit on one last week. It was in the dealers group stock and it was delivered to the dealer yesterday. I went to have a look today and it has quite a few swirl marks on the paintwork. I had asked that it wasn't washed before I took delivery of it but it was washed at the dealership it was originally at as it was on display as part of an event they had. They have said they will get the local detailer they sometimes use to remedy this but I'm concerned this will cover them for a short while but they will then return. It's taken the shine (excuse the pun!!) off getting the Q5. I'm not sure what to do as I'm spending a lot of money on a car that doesn't now feel pristine."
"A quick polish will hide the swirls and as you suspect they will return when the polish wears off.It seems unlikely the dealer will pay for a machine polish and proper detail?Machine polishing can remove swirls, but only if done properly and will reduce thickness of the paint. Beware there are many cowboys."
"Firstly, welcome to the forum, Baxt.Sorry to hear of the swirls problem with your new Q5 which, IMHO, are unacceptable on a new vehicle, so I would be asking the dealer to pay for a full detail by a company of your choice......good luck!BTW, what colour, spec and model have you bought?"
Hi guys - am I right in saying that after getting all this work done. You will still get swirls if the car is not washed properly ?
"X2Even by following the above. You will still cause swirl marks.The tip is to reduce the amount of swirls.I was looking at getting a leaf blower to remover touching the car, but Mrs Rappy said that was to OCD."
"Thanks for the welcome!! I've gone for a Navarra Blue 2.0 TDI S-Line with Tech Pack and 20"" Y Spoke alloys.The dealership are adamant they will use a local detailer (waiting to get the name!!) so they feel this will remedy the issue, they aren't interested in giving me anything off to go to one of my choosing. Apparently this is being done tomorrow so I'll have to see what it looks like afterwards. I've told them if I don't think it's acceptable I'll cancel the order, which they didn't seem too bothered about to be honest!! I can't believe car dealerships have no idea how to wash a car, my A5 is Sepang Blue and I had a similiar issue with that after the dealership cleaned it....morons."
I'm waiting to speak to the detailer so he can explain what he is doing. It's taken the excitement out of getting the car to be honest!!
"Old_Geezer said:Hi and welcome to the forum.Firstly there is a lot of misunderstanding when it comes to detailing cars.

Generally there are more s line models than the slightly lower spec sport model available as they are more popular.I would have thought for your budget you should get a decent low mileage (less than 21k), though used car prices have increased significantly recently."

Can i do it manually by my self or should i hire locksmith? if anyone have some idea kindly share with me.
You need VCDS to disable the module mate.

Your Audi dealer should be able to change the program for a small fee.

Carista can do it for free.

"Hi,I have just replaced my 2017 model with the new 2021 model and I have noticed Audi have been on a cash saving exercise with the latest Q5.Most annoyingly is that that have now removed the SD slots and External SIM card for the Q5.If anyone has been using the in-car WiFi with their own SIM, then this is no longer possible, you are now forced to use the in-built eSIM.I would be happy to use but you can only buy data packages from one vendor, Cubic Telecom and their prices are extortionate. They want £100 for 60GB of data, but I have a SIM that gives me 30GB for £10 per month. I've now had to go purchase a cellular - WiFi device for use in car, which still works out way cheaper.Just giving people the heads up as I never thought to check when ordering the new car.-Kerr"
Do you have Android Auto wireless?Can you use your phone as a hot-spot and still stream /connect?You would have to think that they would offer some way of connecting with a 3rd party SIM or gadget.Your solution sounds like the best compromise.
The Q5 does not support Android Auto Wireless. Only Apple wireless is supported.For Android Auto you have to connect via cable still. Yes you can share your data via a hotspot on the phone but the Q5 is unable to connect and use.
That makes it look even less appealing.I thought that the technology would have progressed further.
Do you have Alexa enabled?That is going to require a data connection so after your free trial period there still has to be a way to keep Alexa enabled?You would think that using the phone as a hot-spot / data connection would have to be an option.It's probably worth reading the small print regarding the services and limitations.
I am not sure if Alexa is US only but I did not get the option to enable Alexa on my MMI when I added the primary user. I cannot find any option where you can enable the MMI to use your phone data connection either. You seem to be tied to using the eSIM.
That's interesting - according to theAudi UK siteeven the entry level Sport has Alexa.I'm not sure about phone connection but maybe through the USB cable?
"I had a look at the car, it appears I can connect Amazon Music but I saw nothing about Alexa. The only way to connect Android Auto is via USB."
Doesn't it have Wireless Android Auto?
"Morning all, just a query to find out if this has happened to anyone who owns a q5. I have a 2016 Q5 2.0 TDI 190Q Sline with 65000 kms.driving to work last week and car just stopped no warning lights was brought to audi garage and they found melted plastic and debris around timing kit. This damaged chain had moved it out of sync which in turn damaged engine. New engine now required but no one seems to know how thishappened.caris out of warranty but has audi servicerecord.audihave offered70% off parts but still a substantial amount remaing(6000 euro) to replace engine.. Has anyone encountered a problem such as this?I'm not mechanically minded and have limited knowledge on cars/engines so any feedback greatly appreciated.Thanks"
"Welcome to our forumSorry to hear about your engine failure. At only 65,ooo Km this is very unusual. I believe your car has timing belt not timing chain?I would guess the timing belt tensioner failed. I would expect there would have been a great deal of noise coming from the engine before the belt / (or chain?) jumped the sprockets?Not every fault will generate a warning light. If car makes unusual noises it is advisable to get it checked."
"Welcome to the forum.Check your Q5 Owners manual or service book for recommended timing belt replacement intervals - I think it should be at 75k miles or 5 years old? Also how long ago was the last service and inspection by Audi dealer? Maybe with a full Audi service history and this part failing before Audi says it should be replaced, along with a recent inspection, you might have a bit more leverage/persuasion in getting Audi to offer hopefully more than 70% of the cost. Might also be worth contacting Audi HQ in Spain.Did you hear any strange noises prior to the timing kit failing?"

"To be fair, timing belt & tensioner can fail on many makers engines with catastrophic damage to the engine when the timing slips.It is unusual that your belt failed prematurely.When was your car last serviced?"
"Got big service and health check Audi last August 2020,was due service a few weeks ago.The burnt plastic and debris wore out the belt, I seen a picture of belt and it looked like a belt that had done 200000kms.But no one knows in Audi where plastic and debris came from."
I have been reading the problem forum and there seems to be an awful lot of problem rattles with these roofs so can I have so up to date opinions as I'm starting to think should I cancel this option ?Cheers Dave
I had it on my previous Q5 and now on my current SQ. No problems. at all.Kids love it and so do I.I'd order it again without hesitation.
Who needs it? will you use it? do you want that much light in the cabin?Apparently can't have side-steps fitted if Panoramic roof because of weight distribution etc.I say save your ££'s for better specs
"I ordered the pano on the current SQ and then cancelled it off having read numerous troubling posts, some people have had zero problems and others are plagued by creaks and rattles. Audi seem to have introduced a grease for the rubbers and runners and in more recent months I haven't read anything negative for a while. My guess would be that you will be OK now.After a very troublesome Evoque with a creaky roof (and that didn't open either) I'm perhaps overly sensitive to such things and conscious that such noises are likely to originate close to the driver's head anyway and decided on balance not to take the risk."
"U can have roof with steps,but not if u have tow bar,4 weight reasons ,as SJ said,my roof has just started to rattle,I Neva noticed but my pal did,it's due it's first service very soon so I'll get it sorted then,it does giv the cabin a lot of light and makes the 2 tone leather stand out,it's nice to have ,but u have to always shut if u take a phone call on Bluetooth ,as the person the other end cannot hear u,due to wind í ¼í¸²"
"I had a panoramic roof on my A4 Avant prior to this Q5, which was amazing, which is why I got this Q5 with Panoramic roof - not had any rattles on it and I'm looking forward to the summer.People say you don't need a Panoramic Roof if you have AC, I don't agree - hugely different and I wouldn't buy a car without a panoramic roof or sunroof."
"Both the Q7 & Q5 demonstrators I drove had the panoramic roof and they both rattled, so I didn't order it and would never order one as its too much of a gamble.I love the cocooned feeling you get with the all black interior too."
It's the one option I wish I had added..
Eleven months old and no problem with mine. It's a great option to have.
Never optioned it and don't miss not having one.
"Love it. I think it adds a bit of noise, but we have really nice summer weather and it's a cool feature that I use a lot."
No problems for me and I'm happy I went for it.
"I like it a lot, but do have a knocking noise which i first thought was from the boot.I had a passenger in the back and he thought is more forward, opened the roof and closed it again and the knocking stopped for a short time and then came back."
My car is now 4yrs 2mnths old. It had exact same problem as ictbydesign at 3yrs 4mnths. I simply cleaned the rubbers and applied silicone grease where the runners are and where the rubbers join others parts. It has not made a sound since. I probably will be doing this mini overhaul every 2 years from now. It should also stop the rubber perishing too soon also.Audi should also have this as a service option for those that are not keen on DIY!
"Mine makes a knocking noise, I cure it by opening then closing it again and it usually stops for a bit. I'd mention it to Audi but they will claim its because the car is lowered."
There are some threads on the Tiguan forum ref panoramic roofs and similar problems. Seems the handbook mentions greasing every so often and there have been some Tech bulletins out. Some have had to have subframes replaced. Personally I chose not to have one.
I would never be without it - makes the car a much nicer place to be as s-line interior far too dark without it. Since we got the car have only heard a slight knocking sound twice - both times when it was about -3 or -4 and it stopped as soon as the car warmed up a couple of mins later.
14 months of SQ5 ownership with the pano roof and no problems so far....Touch wood...
"I agree, I wouldn't be without it and would spec it new. At the end of the day it's a mechanical component of the car and will need maintenance at some point. You can't expect it to be maintenance free forever. It's just a shame Audi don't realise that!"
Found this thread on the Tiguan forum.http://www.mytiguan.com/index.php?/topic/23217-are-the-pano-issues-enough-to-warrant-avoiding/#entry251841
I have been reading the problem forum and there seems to be an awful lot of problem rattles with these roofs so can I have so up to date opinions as I'm starting to think should I cancel this option ?Cheers Dave
17 months of ownership and no problems at all with mine - glad I have it.
"In retrospect I would have opted out if I knew of the potential rattle of the pano roof. It is very annoying. I will clean and reapply some grease to the rubber and hope for the best. But, I too feel that Audi is responsible for (1) informing customers; (2) upkeeping the maintenance of the roof and (3) replacing the frame if it is defective.What good is such a pleasant feature if it brings suffering."
The problem forum is good if you use it to try to resolve a current problem you are having but not to get caught up thinking these wonderful cars are bad. AS that is all you will find there are “problems” LOL.

"Agree with Richard above - would get the part number and start searching online for a good deal on a new pump, or a 2nd hand or breaker pump, or an equivalent aftermarket pump. regarding how easy it is to replace I don't know, you might be able to find online some workshop manual images when you have the correct pump part number."

I think the sensor is built into the door lock mechanism. As an option I would have thought there must be a pick up wire somewhere for the door sill lights.
"Noticed a damaged sidewall on one of rear tyres - looks like pothole damage but seems rim has escaped... car has done 8400 miles or so, mainly motorway.The question is do I need 1, 2 or 4 tyres?? Historically I have always understood that tyres on an awd should be replaced at least in pairs and as all 4 if the gap between the tyres on each axle is more than 3mm. Is that still the case? Really don't want to buy 4 but 2 tyres is small beer compared to long term damage to awd system....For reference, they are 21"" Pirelli P Zeros and it's a petrol version, no fancy rear diff...."
I read on the internet that if there is a difference of more than 3/32 nd of an inch which is 2.381 mm between tyres on the same axle then both should be changed. Please don’t take this as mandatory. Have you checked the handbook for any info on this ?
"I agree with this. I had an issue with one of my tyres, and was told there is some tolerance built in across the axle. Having said that, I replaced 2 tyres across the axle because it would have been quite a large tread depth difference for me, and I wanted to play it safe. I don't think the same applies front to rear, only across the axle is greater care needed."
"Could be wrong but I don't recall the handbook saying they should be changed in pairs but it really depends on how much meat is left on the good tyre I suppose? If there's plenty the temptation, at £200 a pop, is to get 1 but that means you'll be forever changing an odd number and always running different tread depths.Probably best practise to buy 2 and keep the undamaged one just in case it happens again."
"Put on radar dimmax r8+ tyres and save afortune.255/40/21102y rated at less than £70 each mail order,ive used them previously and just fitted 2 new ones on the back last weekend at a total fitted cost of £170.Cant tell any difference from the pirellis either grip,wear or noise wise and will not pay any more just for the brand name."
"Thanks - 2 it is. Would have read manual but ever since I spotted it I have been travelling - without the car. A job for my return.It will be same again - only thing that is in contact with road, not something where I really worry about cost, although obviously I will try to get best price for given tyre..."
"Interesting (or not) that the manual seems to contradict itself in stating ""Only use tires ... as close to the same tread pattern as possible on all four wheels"" and then 5 paragraphs later states ""All four wheels must be equipped with tires that are the same brand and have the same construction and tread pattern ...."""
It’s annoying but seems necessary to ditch a good tyre with plenty miles left on it. Keep the good tyre and put it up for sale lol
"It is actually the same in the MK1 manual after all, there's bits about tyres dotted about all over the shop."

I replaced like for like with Pirelli P Zeros - £480 fitted at the local tyre place who looked after me.Rotated front to back as it was a back one that was damaged - so new on front in hope they all 4 need replacing together next time (which if they do 20k miles should get me through to point at which I start thinking what next...)
"I was told today by a transmission specialist, who doesn’t sell tyres by the way, that you should change all 4 if you want to keep your Quattro system in one piece. The 4wd system according to him doesn’t see just one axle at a time. It looks at all 4 corners."
I would have thought that having differentials would deal with slight variations in wheel rotations. Otherwise the system would fail on roundabouts and bends.
"I would agree. My dealer has a price match on tyres and has changed two front tyres for me.Whilst it is true different rolling circumferences will put aditional strain on the system. Front tyres wear faster than rears. Thus, one would need to regularly rotate the wheels if this was a serious issue.With tread wear of up to 5 mm, the difference in diameter would be next to f a on circumference. However, even on two wheel drive car, I would always change both tyres on same axle."
My understanding is that less grip on one tyre that the other makes it spin more under hard acceleration causing stress on the diff.
"The ""recomendation"" is:If one tyre needs replacing you ought to change all four tyres."
"Having, according to our satnav, just floated across the Firth of Forth as the new bridge doesn’t exist, we need to update it.Audi dealer quoting £250 for 2021 maps and a 12 week delay to get the necessary “part” from Germanythis seems bloody expensive and a ridiculous delay - any idea if there is a quicker/cheaper way?"

What year / model Q5 have you got?
"3041- Energy management active - means your car battery is weak / low. Can be a sign that your battery is on the way out and needs to be replaced / charged.4807- EGR system - can be a sign of ""clogged EGR valve"". Try spaying some inlet manifold cleaner or Diesel EGR Valve cleaner through the manifold inlet valve, while the engine is running. Also get a Hydrogen Engine Carbon Clean done. Then spray again.1270- When was the last time you had the air con system recharged? If more than 2 years I would get that done first, and test if AC is working again. Or could need a new AC clutch?"
Run your AC regularly. Even in winter. Otherwise the rubber o rings in the pipework connections will dry and will drop and you will lose the gas. If you do this as it’s a sealed system you will never need to recharge. I’m an AC engineer. Sounds like the clutch on the compressor.

Welcome to our forum
detailingworld is your best bet.Look for someone in your area getting good feedback.
"Avoid we come to you................ IMHO proper detailing can only be done in a controlled environment. Visit your nearest detailer, look at his work before deciding."
I was wondering how soon after buying a brand new car should you get this done and what are the recommended intervals between said finishes?I've had my Q5 4 months and there is a miniscule scratch on the rear panel which catches my eye every time (my wife said it was probably her which means it WAS her).What can i do about this?
LOL
Best to get it done from new and repeat as and whenever. You or rather your detailer will be able to polish out a scratch.
"Thanks, I'll get onto it when I get home.I just wasn't sure how often and when to get this done as I don't want to damage the paintwork."
"There is no simple answer. Machine polishing removes paint, deeper the scratch(es) the more paint will need to be removed. It is not rocket science and some owners DIY. However, a careless detailer can very quickly remove paint down to the primer on panel edges. You might want to buy, beg, borrow or steal a paint thickness meter."
"I do my own cars, for a scratch on a black car I used BlackFire Black Ice on top of wolfgang polish and hey presto problem gone!If you can see base coat then get someone like chips away to touch it up but if you go to your local audi/ VW stealers you may find its the same guy!!! I am not jokingI dropped my wifes car off at eastern VW in Edinburgh and I spotted the chips away guy working on 2 cars to get them ready to sell! He was really useful at getting rid of a few scratched on my A3 before i traded it in for my Q5"
My dealership wanted £800.00 for the Autoglym.Getting a company calledPure Detail to do mine.
"José said:The problem is these protection offerings are all about what you do before you apply it...You don't want to seal in swirl marks and any other imperfections. Getting the paintwork prepped at minimum is a 3-4 hour job, some guys spend 2 days doing it!Dealerships employ a couple of 17 year olds to wash the cars when they are in for service - guess who also does the paint protection...Applying the protection is also a skill in itself to get and even coating all round etc. Again, something I would say takes years of experience to get right.Detailing is a skill and an art form, get someone who feels this way about the profession to do your car, not a young petrol head.The dealership job will probably look 'OK' on the day, but not 'GREAT' but more importantly it will last only a few weeks due to poor application. Also consider the cost, most dealerships charge between 2 and 4 times what a professional detailer does!!! This for me is frankly disgusting!Click to expand...Yes, I was pretty convinced with all the posts , thanks, and Jose pretty much nails it here.Had contact with this guy, and he sent me a good, detailed reply in response.Think I'll be going with him.http://www.autocleanngleam.co.uk/"
"Reading the info on the 'New Car Detail' package it seems to do the job and £235 is a fair price (I paid £200 mates rates with my detailer). Of course I can't speak for their work quality, but the pics and testimonials on the website look like they are the real deal."
"I will try to take some pictures of mine ""Autoglymed""after I pick it up on 1st March."
"Ransman said:I have been impressed with the standard of preparation of both Audi's I have collected so far, and they were ""standard prep"".Would a detailer do better? I am sure they would.Is it worth paying for Autoglym? Very unlikely.Is it worth having for free? Absolutely, as far as I am concerned.If there are any issues with the finish they will be rectifying it, but my experience with Bristol Audi has been very good to date so I am not anticipating a problem.Click to expand...I think part of this is how particular you are about your paintwork... 99% of people are happy with a clean car.But then there are people like myself that want it better than showroom condition.I'm sure you'll be more than happy with what Bristol do - as you say, a detailer could have done better, but how far you want to go is a matter of personal taste."
"Sj1000 said:Thanks for that & welcome to the forum,Thanks to all the other posts/advice too, all helps in the decision making process.So I'll just pick the car up with standard prep, then take the £299 I've saved up toaperfectshinedetailingand get the 'new car detail' package.Thing is, a brand new car straight from dealership 'should' look pretty damn polished and clean by the average punter's standards (me), are you saying I should be able to see a discernible improvement in the polish level when it come out of there a few hours later ?For me it's more about getting the correct paint protection etc underway from the off, but obviously I'll be happy with a new level of 'shine' !!I'll take some before and after pics.Click to expand...Yeah, share please."

"I'd appreciate some advice please. My Audi Connect data package was finally turned off after four years - 2017 Q5 sport - and, after reading the threads on here, bought a 3 sim data card. I appear to have it activated as I am getting a 3g signal showing and it has received 3mb of data.I want to be able to view the satellite overlay and get traffic updates via the data connection but haven't been able to get any of that at the moment.

"Folks, we only picked up our 66 plate Q5 around 2 weeks ago. The dealers only had the 1 key and promised to supply another. They are sending it on after the weekend however I think it will need programmed to the car. Is this an Audi only thing or can it be done other places. what’s the typical cost to program the key. I’m in Central Scotland so any recommendations welcome. Cheers."
"Hi markyboy 1967. I googled car key programming in different areas of Central Scotland and a few came up in the Glasgow, Edinburgh and Stirling areas. Might be worth giving the one in your area a call to see if they can do your model before you receive the key. That way if Audi gives you a price then you may haggle with them. I thought they would have offered to program your key as a goodwill gesture. Best of luck."
"Thanks for the reply, yeah the garage said they would pay for the key and programming but if it’s not much I will likely pay for it myself. After being on here I checked and got 1 reply quoting £90 to program it from a car locksmith so will see what Audi want. Cheers."
I was quoted £270 for a new key for my q5 last year. That was a main Audi dealer.
"Thanks for the replies, I already have the new key which the dealer has now supplied so it just needs coded to the car. I have a quote of £90 from a car locksmith to come to us and code the key."
Any competent garage should have the equipment and be able to do that for you. £90 call out seems a reasonable price to pay for a call out - i.e. to come to your home address..
Surely the dealer who supplied you with the new key should code it to your car free of charge.
"The dealer are a sports car specialist dealer and not an Audi dealer, mostly Aston Martin, Porsche etc etc. They did say they would pay for it to be done but it's not really worth it if it's only £90 or less."
"Aah...I see, then it’s best to get it coded at an Audi dealer."
"My A4 only came with one key, the dealer recoded the car, existing key and new key. It's a long shot that the missing key could fall into the wrong hands but by recoding the car it's rendered pretty much useless anyway."
"You should have three ""keys"". two remote fobs and one emergency key that fits in the dummy fob in your glovebox. you can check how many keys are programmed to the car through the MMI. probably a bit OCD but it's worth getting any keys that you don't have in your possession removed from the system"
"I need a new key but am confused about where to get it, I thinklocksmithwould get me at cheap."
From your local Audi dealer. It needs to be coded to your car for the alarm and to start the car.

"Hi,new to the forum so apologies if this has been asked before.The swirl flaps in the inlet manifold are remaining open and causing reduced power, rough idle and the engine light to come on. Been quoted £750 for a inlet manifold replacement!however, following online research and speaking to some tuning specialists, Ive been advised I can get the swirl flaps deleted from the ecu and remapped. They advised the swirl flaps do not need to be removed to the remap. They have also offered to delete the egr and dpf filters (this includes removing the dpf, gutting it and replacing it).my question is, would the remap and swirl flap delete without removing the flaps themselves cause any long term engine issues? Anyone had this done?Any advice on this would be great!"
Welcome to our forum
Welcome. I have not heard of the deletions you mention. I have seen pictures of the swirl flaps and egr being cleaned to solve problems.

"If it isn't a leak from the rear screen washer pipe. Check the rear wiper seal, light seals, etc.I would be removing the inner trim panels to find the source."

"If you don't want to take it to a main Audi dealership. Take it to a reputable local VW/Audi independent garage and get them to have a look at it.Otherwise check the rubber seal all around the boot, make sure they are clean, and crack/damage free. Make sure the struts are oiled/greased, and the locking mechanism is also working properly and greased. This can help the boot close tighter and maybe more waterproof. Would also check what Richard above suggests - you need to find the source. Maybe try only covering certain areas with the plastic like the left, right or centre to trial and error locate the leak."
Thank you. The plastic was only to stop the liquid pouring into the boot when the door was open. I hoped in would drain it sufficiently.. The only problem with my battery was down to lack of use! I would prefer to reduce the level to bellow the electrics before I start her up.I will investigate the source later this pm.
"if the drain holes are filling up make some new ones? drill and a 5mm metal drill bit in the lowest part of the door/boot will resolve the problem. people will say but the metal hole will rust, well yeah over a few years it will but it will at least stop any electrical problems inside the rear boot and also leaving the water will also cause the entire rear boot lower section to rust from the inside out.Do yourself a favour....check this as it is a common fault, take out your spare wheel or bass box and remove the plastic tyre jack stuff to view the battery is the battery also swimming in water? there is a plug hole there that blocks up too leaving your battery to swim in water too..."

I seem to remember an issue with brake servo failure & being replaced foc. You might like to search this and other forums
"Thank you. I have since been looking at another forum, Audi ownersclub.comand there are maybe 100 cases All with exactly the same error warnings. This has to be a real fault which should have been a recall. Once it gets to the don’t drive error message the cost seems to be iro £3k. Appalling treatment by Audi. I should not have even driven away without the full enormity of the fault being made clear to me. This could even cost lives if brakes failed on the road. I haven’t yet finished reading to the end of the reports. Maybe somebody will start a class action ?Should I keep this topic updated ?"
"Did you read the paperwork stating - 'Defective G608 vacuum sensor requires replacement continuous use may cause further damage To brake system and lead to further cost.' Before leaving the dealer, or did the dealer make you aware of this before you left? Its a shame you didn't just leave the car at the dealership until it could be fixed. Would be good to have topic updated to conclusion for other that may have this issue in the future. Hopefully still a servo seal cheap fix for you 🤞"
"Sorry for you but nice to know that we m/f are treated equally badly. Why do they assume we are stupid. Nice looking car 👍 that seems a steep charge, best deal I had with my last Audi A4 needing a battery was from AA breakdown who‘d have thought.Auto reply from Audi states they will get back to me within 48 hours. If they’re no help and it is the worst case then I think I’ll go full on attack. 🤬"
Update:I have had a very nice response from an executive assistant to Mr Doyle 🙄 nothing yet to report as he will get back to me within 48 hours. It’s a start. I hope Audi put their big pants on and take responsibility for this parts failure which seems to encompass so many models. I do believe it is dangerous and could be catastrophic if the brakes failed while on a motorway. I’ll keep this topic updated.
"That is typical of the response others have reported from Audi UK.Some have taken their complaint to Audi Germany.Audi Head Office Address, Contact Number of Audi Head Office (address001.com)"

Not quite -SQ5 more expensive than a Macan
Is that pads and discs? They ought to have given you a link to a video showing your worn pads and remaining thickness of disc.I would not let Kwik-fit near my car.
"Yes rear pads only, they said they were 80% worn, no warning lights yet showing for wear indicators."
Rear pads have no sensors (only fronts). Don't use Kwik-Fit!! Buy the pads and change them yourself or get a good local independent to change them for you. Preferably an Audi specialist.
The brake lights do come only on for front brake pad wear as far as I know. The rear wears more on Audi. I had my rear brake pairs changed at 24k miles by an indy Audi specialist using oem Audi parts for £95. Audi quoted around £210.
"Thanks folk, a very local garage that looked after my Z3 has offered:For us to supply and fit rear pads is £152.For us to fit only is £72.So I think I will have a browse at ECP and take their £72 offer!Car has done 30K by the way with no trace on the history report of any changes being done to the rear pads so possibly these are the originals."

"I thought we were all set to buy a used Audi SQ5. We took it for it's final test drive and my husband was hesitant. He said he didn't like the rumble of the exhaust in the cabin, especially in the dynamic mode. We are past our days of wanting to hear our car rumble. ; ). I recall reading somewhere that this is not a true exhaust sound but a manufactured sound. I've done a bit of googling and find people who say it is, some say it's not and other's say there are speakers in the exhaust which pipe the sound into the cabin. I also saw a video that said this is from a module located in a side panel of the cargo area which can be unplugged. Does anyone have any knowledge if this is a true sound or a manufactured sound that can be disabled?"
"Googling more, an Audi owner said there are two reasons for more sound in the Dynamic mode. First, that there are valves on the exhaust which are more fully open in Dynamic mode. Secondly, sound is generated by the Soundakator and that the soundakator can be turned off via OBD11. Not sure what this means or the accuracy of what I read. Any opinions?"
"We have just purchased a 2013 s line Q5, and want to fit a dog guard, I have seen several netting types that clip into the inserts in the head lining , as we have four dogs we were hoping to fold the back seats down and use one of the these types rather than a metal rigid one, has anyone got any leads on where to get one from , several on Ebay but all are for later models, any ideas or suggestions would be appreciatedCheersSteve"
There is little (if any?) difference in the intereior dimensions so if it fits a later model it ought to fit your 2013 Q5. I would suggest you contact manufacturer to confirm.
ok cheers i was thinking there shouldnt be too much difference

"Looking at Autotrader some 2018 68 reg Q5 3.0 TDi's have the ""50"" emblem some don't.

The next confession is that I'm not that gentle a driver...........J"
"I got 18.5k out of my 20"" Dunlops on my standard Q which wasn't too bad. I was going to replace them with the Goodyear Excellence, but I've just swapped them for something much cheaper given it will be getting traded in at the start of the year!"
"Thanks Justin, appreciated, I've considered the Bridgestones but they are quite expensive it's fallen to Asda Tyres for Goodyear Excellences @ £887 for a set of 4...."
"Hi john, thats a good price for a set of four, hope you get more miles from the Goodyears, Didnt even know Asda sold tyres !!,All the best Merlin."
"I got 25+K miles out of the 19"" Michelins on my Q5. I have 20"" Bridgestones on my SQ5."
"Thanks Missile!Merlin - Asda and tyres, me neither until a couple of days ago and to be honest I thought Google was having a wonky moment however it's real and they are ultra competitive - Walmart purchasing power I guess. The local Halfords AutoCentre is the fitting shop."
"I believe Asda are very competitive. You might want to check Costco, if you have or can beg borrow or steal a membership card."
"Had bridgestones on my old Q5 and got 30k + miles out of them. Have goodyears on the SQ, have covered 10k and seem to be okay still."

"Out of interest, and I may have missed this so apologies if I have, has anyone sourced winter tyres for the 21s?"
"G Dog, as you have probably discovered by now the SQ is quite quick and there's a price to pay if the OEM tyres are on the soft end of the possible wear rating...The Michelin Latitude Sport is rated a 220 - the Goodyear Excellence is rated at 340 - the baseline starts at 100/"
"Don't think 255/ 40-21"" Winter Tyres are available.Would step down to 20"" or 19"" if I had a chose over 21"""
"No me neither but as Audi can't seem to supply a set of winter wheels & tyres this side of Feb/Mar, I was hoping I could find tyres to fit my 21s..."
"I also can't find a 255/40/21 winter tyre manufactured anywhere, unless someone else knows differently...?I do however have a barely-used set of winters which are 255/45/20, and am thinking of buying a new set of wheels to put them on to.OEM wheels seem stupidly expensive (absurd that the Audi winter wheel / tyre combination is in fact cheaper than buying the wheels alone), but its all hypothetical because having tried, there don't seem to be any dealers with stock or who are able to get their hands on them anyway."
"Cheers CarrottI do like the look of the first wheel - seems to be a tad over a grand for a set if my currency conversion is about right.Have you got any direct experience of dealing with these guys?My 20"" winter tyres were supplied direct by the dealership and it looks like these are genuine OEM Audi wheels, so I presume there wouldn't be a need to notify insurers of a change / modification to the vehicle?"
I don't think you guys in central England really require the winter tyre package as the standard tyres you have providing they have good tread depth as the quatro system will work.But if you really need the winter tryes the Aui 20 package is really worth the price.
If you can get it!
Which you can't - until Feb/mar that is....poor poor planning by AUK...
"I would also highly reccomend Oponeo. I have bought 2 sets of winter tyres from them and they are able to supply tyres that the usual outlets such as Kwik-Fit, ATS, National plus the other on line suppliers like Blackcircles could not offer.I bought a set of Pirelli Scorpion Winters which were delivered in 5 days by DPD couriers all the way from Poland.Good value too."
"Barbyboy,Have you thought about sourcing wheels and tyres separately given the current supply problem for the whole package from Audi? Oponeo and others can provide good value on tyres if you can find suitable wheels, 19"" or 20"" for SQ5. Ebay is always worth a look and although it can be a feast or a famine there full sets of 19"" S Line 5 spokes come up quite often, 20"" ones less commonly."
Yes bought Audi and Porsche Cayenne items from them and had good service.
"CarrottMany thanks for your guidance.Have just bought a set of the titanium grey 20"" wheels (top photo in your thread) through the German firm you recommended - they speak reasonable English, order and payment process was all very straightforward (with typical Germanic efficiency) and goods will be delivered early next week.It's a genuine Audi OEM wheel so no insurance issues to worry about / declare and, almost half the price of a UK dealership quote.Winter tyre / wheel matter all sorted finally!Cheers."

Pilot sport 4 are highly rated and lots of people run them on the sq5.others to consider are uniroyal rainsport 5s or the falken. Stay away from pzero they won’t last long.
"Great. Thank you.I did thank that after some research. My old Quattros I needed to buy 4 in one go, at least with this 67 plate I can buy just 2 at a time. Easier on the wallet."
ye defo although you can usually get good deals on 4 tyres. i think it was kwik fit that had a good % off Pilot sport 4s if you buy 4. Also worth considering the goodyear asymetric 4. Mine are due in around 3-4 months so will probably start looking around for a good price.

"Hi All,I recently had the AdBlue pump fail in my 2015 SQ5. Not a great experience and fairly costly. I had extended warranty (after market) on my car which covers the fuel pump but not the AdBlue pump so they rejected my claim.When I did a bit of reading it looks like the AdBlue system is part of the overall fuel system so calling by definition the AdBlue is a pump in the fuel system so by definition a fuel pump. That's my logic anyway.I wanted to see if others had thoughts on this and if I'm being rational or if I have got it all wrong?ThanksSonny"
"Hi all,I have 2018 Q5 and had 3 years Audi connect licence which has now expired. They want £140 for a year to extend the licence.I want to use my own sim to use all the services provided by Audi connect like traffic, satellite view, remote locking from phone app etc.Audi is saying only way i can use these services is by buying extension from them and not by external sim.I tried using my phone sim in the sim tray but it does not seem to work.I want to know if its possible to use external sim for above services or do i have to pay extortionate price to Audi?Thank you in advance."
Audi updated my software to run the replacement to Google Earth overview (which isn't quite as good) and I am now three years and ten months into ownership without paying for a licence. Don't know why they are inconsistent in the way they apply this but I would certainly baulk at paying £140 for a year. If a sim option was a possibility I would go for that but otherwise I would probably just use my phone.
Has anybody used Hemp before? I'm very keen to try some Vegan CBD Gummies for muscle cramps. Can someone recommend a good brand? I am presently contemplatingJustCBDand ActivFit. Thanks in advance

"I just purchased a new 2021 Sq5. After two weeks, the drivers door wouldn't open automatically or when I hit the unlock button on key fob. The other doors all opened. After I did get in and started the car, the drivers side view mirror wouldn't open, but the passenger one did. It wouldn't move when I tried the mirror toggle either. The dealer has already changed the door control module which didn't fix it, and the door latch, which didn't fix it. They are now attempting to try to change the mirror mounting.Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this?Thanks."

"Hi allBought my 1st Audi this week, absolutely love it. I've noticed I only have a general Q5 Owners manual in the glove box. Is it correct that New Audis do not have service books, I noticed on my audi app that it shows the date and details of the dealership that performed the delivery inspection but that's it. Never had a car without a proper booklet to keep personal records of vehicle service history before."
"Hi FULHAMBOY - the Audi dealership keeps service records digitally. When my car was serviced I received a folder with paperwork detailing the work done. The same applies if any repairs are carried out. So you end up with a load of paperwork, rather than a nice tidy booklet with a record of the services carried out. Changed days. Cheers"
"Contact your Audi dealership and ask them to authorise access to your service plan/history in your MyAudi app. Once setup go the MyAudi app > Service Topics > Service Plan - complete service history should be listed, and you can expand each one for further details.You can always ask your Audi dealer to print out a complete service history. Then scan it to PDF and store it electronically, and just update your records after every service."
I HAVE A 2014 Q5. I HAD THE CONCERT RADIO (NON MMI) AND REPLACED IT WITH THE N7 DYNAVIN PRO. NOW I HAVE GPS AND WOULD LIKE TO INSTAL A BACK UP CAMERA. THE N7 PRO IS SUPPPOSED TO BE PLUG AND PLAY. I HAVE TRIED INSTALLING THE CAMERA MYSELF BUT NOTHING WORKS. DO I NEED THE CAMERA INTERFACE MODULE I SEE IN INSTALATION VIDEOS OR AM DOING SOMETHING WRONG? I KEEP GETTING MIXED INFORMATION FROM SEVERAL SOURCES AND WOULD LIKE TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE ALREADY.
"THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING. DIDNT KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE GRAMMER POLICE (WHO CARES IF IM POSTING IN ALL CAPS) AND THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (IM AWARE DYNAVIN ISNT STANDARD) NEXT TIME YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOMEONES POST, TRY NOT TO BE SOcondescending.IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AUDI'S, YOU WOULD KNOW WHEN I MENTIONED THAT I HAVE A CONCERT RADIO, (AUDI DOESN'T INCLUDE A BACK UP CAMERA OR GPS ON Q5 OR Q7 IF YOU HAVE A CONCERT RADIO) AND THAT IS WHY I DIDNT HAVE GPS OR A BACKUP CAMERA IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN OTHER WORDS I DIDN'T HAVE A CAMERA INTERFACE MODULE FROM THE BEGINING. A SMARTPHONE MOUNTED ON A DOCK IS FINE FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT IF ITS OK WITH YOU, I WOULD PREFER A SYSTEM THAT I WANT, REGARDLESS IF IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU OR FOR ANYONE ELSE."

"Does anyone know if the after the rear electronic parking brake has been retracted, does the caliper piston needs a special tool to rewind further and do they also need to be rotated?"
Just looked on YouTube. Special tool used to force piston back. No rotation apparently needed.
Which video did you watch?Looks like its just compressed (2010 model) -
All I can remember is that it appeared to be an Indian gentleman doing the fitting. Speaking reasonable English using a compression tool that fitted the caliper.
Sounds like the Terraclean I had done. Dunno how they connected it up as I didn't hang around. Can't say I noticed any difference or improvement.

Audi dealer will be happy to sell you any part for any car. It should be a straight swop. However it is not a quick / easy job to change the grill.

"I have owned a 2018 model Q5 Sline 2.0 TFSI since new, which has averaged 33 mpg over 18600 miles, which I have recorded from full tank to full tank refills, and I have achieved 550 miles on a full tank when driving through France.On mostly urban journeys, I average about 28-31 mpg, depending on weather conditions, and about 34-37 mpg on motorway trips.I'm afraid I haven't any experience of the SQ5, though I'm in the process of selling my Q5 to buy a Porsche Macan S 3.0 V6, which I think will have a similar fuel consumption to a SQ5."
Thanks AllanG!This helps a lot with the 2.0 figures and is more than acceptable. I suppose now the question is how far is the SQ5 from those figures and I don't think a 20 minute test drive will tell me this
I struggled to get 25+mpg with my Q5 2.0TFSI and get 40+mpg with my SQ5 3.0TDI.

"DAVMO said:Hi Skiman,Owner of a Vorsprung 2.00 TDI ; purchased June 2020. 21 inch wheels and Air Suspension.Done approx 3K and up to now simply great ; very comfortable ; tried various settings on suspension....but left on comfort. No problems so far [touch wood]Technology is very good ; Previous cars where BMW X3 ; Mazda CX5; VW Tiguan ; this so far is the best. Should be for the price!!Bought Tyre and Alloy Insurance just after purchase as a bit unsure about those big wheels.Any further info just ask .Click to expand...Do you mind me asking the cost of the tyre and wheel insurance and is this with Audi or taken out separately?"
"Hi Skiman,Sorry for very late reply, Cost for tyre and alloy cover was £297. taken out with Total Loss. Still enjoying Q5 .....more so.... as just tested it out in snow and no problems whatsoever.Have also used Off Road setting in forest roads [air suspension] and again excellent.First service due this month through Audi service plan."
"Thanks for the info. Since my last post have now taken delivery of the Vorsprung model. The suspension is great so no issues with 21inch wheels apart from likely future kerbing issues. Prior to getting my motor had a small issue with the car before delivery so the dealer agreed to throw in free of charge, alloy wheel damage/minor scuff repair cover this should have been £595. Hope I don't need to make a claim though."
"DAVMO said:Nice to hear that you are a new Vorsprung owner. Hope you are enjoying it even if it maybe sitting on the drive/road during the lockdown !I have had mine for nearly 8 months and done only 6K which is very low milage for me.Would be interested to know your MPG average. I haven't reset the 'long term memory' since pick up and average over 6k is 44/45 mpg; however this has dropped down to 40 since the cold weather. Was regulary getting up to 50mpg in summer on dual carriageway trips.Yes agree the air suspension is very comfortable even with 21 inch wheels. Lowering the back end to get things out of the boot is great. Have tried Off Road setting once and all ok. Should be good in snow etc.Up to now all the tech is working fine although I do miss a heated steering wheel right now. Bearing in mind that this is a very expensive vehicle this should be standard fitment. My partner has heated wheel and windscreen on her fiesta !!Not so sure about the Sat Nav voice recognition....it takes a number of tries to get the correct address even after using the voice test.

My last q5 was approx 47mpg.I haven't taken out the service plan but the car has been set at the variable servicing so should be in approx 19k ish or two years from new."

"Justanhonestman said:I've written in a previous thread how my Audi connect expired and I got it renewed for another 12 months. Rather than ring C/S I was on Audi UKs website and a little box appeared asking if I needed help with any enquiry in live chat. I wrote that I thought I would have got more than 3 months trial considering the cost of the car. The guy asked if I was enjoying the car etc etc. Of course I said yes not mentioning the brake pedal issue lol. After a bit of light hearted banter he asked if it was ok to extend my trial by another 12 months and asked for my reg number. Of course I said yes and he did. It took a few days to re - activate but I wasn't complaining. Try the website and see if a live chat box appears, it may save you a call.

"Audi extended my Audi connect for free last year I think, a message popped up today about renewing it, has anyone any info on this as I cannot seem to log in to myaudi to get a price ?"
Price depends on which model Q5 you have and how old it is?

"Thanks AllanG most appreciated, I don't think I will bother paying a fortune for this subscription especially as the Google earth overlay on the Sat Nav is being discontinued, if my subscription was still current would not be happy losing this function."
Funny enough AllanG was thinking about a Macan for my next Car is yours a S ?
Had a call from the Audi garage. They are going to run a software update that will extend the licence until December next year FOC. They are potentially looking at another service provider and will advise when known.
Had the update done today and first impressions are that it's better than the plain maps but not as good as Google Earth overlay.
"What update, and how? Why are they not Google Maps like before?"
"My Audi connect has now expired, does anyone know how to renew these licenses, and how much it costs to renew them. Is it done through the dealer?"
I can only suggest that you read my posts in this series as that's all I know. It is a different mapping service which does not appear to be so detailed and has a darker background. It's definitely a step down from Google Earth and I shall be reporting that to customer services. Do you still have Google Earth?

"Hi all,Having just purchased a 2018 SQ5, I'm wondering if anyone has purchased rubber mats for this model Q5/SQ5?I just put mine in and noticed the drivers side is quite short when you think any splashing from the feet end up on the main carpet. When comparing to fabric mats, they fit nicely under the pedals.Just curious if this is the same for anyone else hereThanks in advance!"
"I’ve recently sold my 2018 Q5, which was fitted with the genuine Audi rubber mats, and I agree that the drivers side mat was a little short in length compared to the genuine fabric mats, but I found the carpet under the pedals stayed fairly clean and dry."
Perfect thank you!
I went from 2.0TFSI to 3.0TDI and really noticed the improvement in performance and fuel economy.
"I went from a 2007 A6 2.7 TDI Multitronic to a 2017 Q5 2.0 TDI Tiptronic.Loved to smooth V6 and the Multitronic. The 2.0 straight 4 is quiet on the move, performance is much the same and economy is much improved, over 10mpg better. The Tiptronic is not a patch on the Multitronic which spoils the drivability a bit."
Thanks both -I guess Missile is probably more closer to what I am doing as its a petrol > diesel (mines the other way round) but TGR - that V6 smooth comment is exactly what I do not want to let go.The Q5 I had been looking at has potentially one so still no test drive however I am potentially putting an SQ5 3.0 tfsi on the list. Just not sure about 37k miles on an 18 plater - most likely motorway as the car is spotless inside (and out) and my current mileage is very low so I'm sure I would average it out for the 3 year marker in no time
"My 3.0 tdi did 56,000 miles in it's first 3 years. It uses no oil. Averages 41 + mpg. Over 50 mpg on a longer run. Petrol is quieter but not as economical. Now on 91,000 miles. Drive it. If you like it buy it."
"Bought a 67 plate Audi Q5 a few weeks ago, the lights were on all the time in the footwell now they don’t come on. Is there something I can do to get them back on again"
I have been enjoying my 2014 Q5 for a little over a year now and have started to think about a few little DIY improvements and tidying up the car a bit. The interior is generally good but an area of significant wear is the drivers side B Pillar trim panel where the seat belt adjustment is. I have found out how to unclipthe trim panel however I am stumped as to how the seat belt can be removed so the panel can be replaced and cannot find any information online.I appreciate that this is a safety feature and may require specialist knowledge and might require a trip to a mechanic but having managed to find a good condition trim panel I am keen to replace my tatty one.Advice and guidance greatly appreciated.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Can't afford a 3.0tdi so am between buying the new shape 2.0tdi or go old school with a late V6.Has anyone found the 2 litre model to be a bit lacking regarding overtaking 30-50 and 50-70 wise?
The 2.0TDI is a very nice car and more than capable on the road. It can be a bit slow off the mark and that shitty stop / start system does not help.
Currently BMW325d coupe 197bhp so similar power though lighter 1590kg compared to the Q5 1770kgI will try and get an extended test drive though think I am just going to have to either save my pocket money up or be happy with the older 3.0tdi modelWant anSQ5now! much difference between the petrol and diesel versions?
There are some 40 to 60 times here that might be helpful.http://www.automobile-catalog.com
The 2L PETROL engine on the new Q5 is awesome.
"I agree completely. The official UK figures for 0 - 60 times show that it is quite quick. Even quicker when quoted in the US...I do not know why this is but it is quoted as 0-60 in 5.8 seconds in some videos etc. In fact for 4 years a ran a BMW X3 xDrive 30d M Sport and found as soon as I got in my Q5 2.0 litre petrol it felt quicker in the different speed ranges. It is the acceleration in speed ranges like 20 mph to 50 mph and 40 mph to 70mph, where it holds on to the lower gears for longer that impresses."
It even sounds good when you floor it - would you agree?
"I agree with Rickenbacker, i've had mine for over 2 years and found the speed to be more than adequate, and I switched from a A4 3 litre quattro tdi!"
Agreed - fantastic blend of performance and economy.
Yes it is if you want a diesel! Many people do not! Witness row upon row of them: used and new outside my local dealership. I will be having one as loaner whilst mine goes in for investigation for the clangy brake pedal.
"I find my new shape Q5 diesel more than adequate as regards performance.It can feel a big sluggish sometimes but this is due to the DSG 'box rather than the engine. If you're pulling out of a busy junction, roundabout or doing an overtake you absolutely have to flick into S mode.I was lucky to attend a corporate day at Mercedes Benz World this week and had a good session in a C63S, in comparison to this, the Q5 did feel a bit pedestrian like after....;-)"
"Akin to getting off your bike and getting into your Q5!After driving around locally in my wife's 2019 Polo 1.0 TSI 95 SE 5dr DSG and then getting into my Q5, the Q5 feels very quick. For a 4 pot 2.0 litre petrol it is."
A client of mine has the TFSI version and even that feels very quick compared to my TDI Q5.
"I've had 2 x 2L DIESEL Q5's, now I'm on 2L PETROL and loving the increased performance. My average economy is 34Mpg, but it really shifts when I want it to and it sounds great too in Sports Mode."
But buy a Carista for £25 and you can set stop/start to remember last setting and also change light to 'on' when system is active. Did that and a few other tweaks... so no issues now and even more happy with my Q5 2.0TDi .Sent from my moto g(9) play using Tapatalk

I was originally going to take it to the Audi dealership but the price they were asking for seemed extremely high. I understand maintenance is going to be more expensive than my Toyota but not that more expensive.How much does it typically cost for a 40,000 mile service?Other than the Audi dealership any suggestions on where to take it?

Carista will do it. Cheaply if you use the trial only.

"Currently using Dodo juice products, high levels of carnauba wax and easy to use.Use lime prime first which basically polishes the paintwork then use the wax to protect the paint. Polish only once a year and wax once a month or two."
I use the bilthamber range.www.bilthamber.com. They have won quite a few awards from Autoexpress magazine
I agree with missile. Polishedbliss are great. I was advised by them to stay away from natural products with light (white) coloured cars.

Remember your wheel sealant and wheel brush.

That stuff defies logic with regards finish and the amount of time the product continues to protect. Expensive but seriously impressive, especially if you're short on time to maintain the car ongoing."
Had mine detailed from new and my guy swears by the new Autogylm high def wax. Mine looked so good I used it on my wifes car and that is looking splendid as well. It lasts well and you can top the shine up with Aquawax. (I've done this once on my wifes car. Or just use a wash wax when washing as I do on mine.) I'm also using the Autoglym wheel protector with good results but I'd stay away from their tyre dressing as it migrates onto the alloy the first time you wash the car. I've used Meg's Gold Class products in the past and also had good results with them.

No not had this issue. But maybe an MMI reboot/restart or even a factory reset might help? Worth a try.Reset -https://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/41148-q5-mmi-factory-reset/page__fromsearch__1Reboot -

"Yes, the sun blind can be opened or closed to any position along the length of the sunroof.......I’ve got the panoramic sunroof on my 2018 Q5, and I love it!!"
Thank you very much for the quick reply. Greatly appreciated.
"You have to service the sunroof every year, as much as I really love ours it's a pain to get it serviced by dealer or by yourself.The solar blind works really well, can get quite hot with it open, but nice and cool when closed."
HiHas anyone got half decent images images of a Q5 with rock grey interior. Looking on the Audi web site the images are difficult to determine actual colour.Thanks
I have a 2019 SLine 45 TFSI with tow bar prep. It’s on a PCP contract. I’m getting different advice re having a tow bar fitted. Does anyone have any similar experience? If it’s allowed does it have to be OEM Audi fitted as quoted £2000 approx!
I suggest you ask your PCP company for their requirements.

Yeah you definitely need a press which is why i'm looking at a full kit at £268 and about an hour or 2 per side to do it. But as you also say it's hard getting motivation to do it yourself.21

Hi allThe Q5's (2014) gonna need some new boots soon. It's wearing 225/45/20's and currently on Goodyear Excellence.Do I stick with these Audi preferred rubber or is there something better? Only cover c5k a year but interested to know other Q5 owners have ????.CheersDave
Hi coolmacApologies yes tyres are 255 not 225 as I stated - doh!Cheers for info may stick with goodys then but I don't do high mileage and mainly short trips
"I am running CrossClimates. Quiet tyres. Wearing slowly (but I am a gentle driver), good grip in the wet, adequate in the dry - never likely to be as grippy as a summer tyre. Pricey but imho worth the money."

"Can someone on here please remind me what the annual road tax cost is for an SQ5 - either diesel or more recent petrol variant??Having defected to the BMW marque, I'm just coming up to the end of my first year in a petrol X3 M40i and the renewal cost - £495 - has just made me fall off my chair."
Hi BarbyboyUnfortunately car tax rules changed about 2 years ago for all new cars. Your car tax should be £145 however because it would have cost more than £40k there is an additional £320 per year for the first 5 years of the car. After 5 years it goes back to £145.
It is bad that if you can afford a car over 40 grand they then sting you with extra road tax. Rip off Britian.
Thanks everyone.
new SQ5 car tax will be £1300 per year... it's based on emissions plus the extra for it being over £40k ????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Hi JameskThink you are looking at the first year rate which is always higher.Years 2-5 it'll drop to £465 and then to £145 after that

"This is my first Q5, prior to that I've had Land Rovers and Range Rovers. Just curious as to what dive mode is best for driving on Ice/Snow. LR make it easy by having a snow/ice mode!!"
"Hi, last year I didn’t venture out much in my car when the snow fell. But when I did , I kept the drive in comfort mode and any adjustments to steering and throttle etc, were taken slower and smoother than normal dry day to day driving. Got caught out on sheer ice a few times which I expected as I didn’t have winter tyres on. We get a lot of snow in my area, but I tend not to venture out in it if I don’t need too, so it’s not worthwhile putting winter tyres on the car. If your area gets snow often and you will have to drive in it, then a set of winter tyres should be on your note to Santa. Ho Ho Ho"

The winter tyres inspire much confidence, especially at high speed on the autobahns, where sometimes you can come across slush all of a sudden in winter."

"I've just put a deposit down on the older style Q5, up to now I have been using Waze on my android device sort of attached to the dashboard of my old car with a magnetic mount.Just wondered if it can be mirrored or linked up to the Audi screen any way?The car has ""technology pack high""....but am not sure what that is really.Thanks for any advice!"
I don't believe so.
Thanks!...will ensure I take the magnetic mount off my old car and hopefully its still sticky enough to stay on the dash of the Audi!
Must try Waze sometime...I usually use Google maps together with an old Tom Tom. The Audi satnav although updated to 2020 is pretty poor and (to my mind) interferes with the dash displays too much. Putting arrow directions in place of the digital Speedo which I tend to look at rather than the Speedo.

As Ninja21 said there is no CarPlay/Andriod Connection in the older MMI3G+ or lower systems you have to retro fit the module.

Advantage is once fitted as you know your phone does everything these days so doubt you would use the MMI again. I have been looking for apple car play and its the only option for me too

"Hi Scott159I was lucky enough to find a 3.0 s line (2014MY) last year & love it. Power is awesome for quite a big car & doesn't attract the thieves like the SQ.

Tyres on the front of my SQ are going to need changing soon. Nearly at 15k so slightly less miles than some owners but happy enough. I currently have Pirelli but was thinking of trying the Dunlop's. My back tyres are still good so only changing the fronts. Has anyone else just changed 2? Has anyone else got two different makes? I would keep them the same across axle! I should have changed front to back but forgot!Cheers
My other question is do they have to be RO1 fit as I could get other makes with same speed etc and still xl tyres?
Interested in this thread. I need my first front pair of tyres at 26k. Very impressed how long they have lasted. Still have around 3/4mm left. But shopping around for a replacement.Let us know what you go for.Rappy
RappyWhat tyres are you on to get 26k out of them? Maybe I'm going round corners a bit fast?James
Same as you P Zero's. Never had tyres last more than 15k. Very impressed!Rappy

Be careful my sq has Pirelli noise cancelling system on them also insurance companies can invalidate your insurance if not the right spec tyre IE AO or ROI
Find it very quiet.Fuel consumption.....hmm depends how you drive.I think i would sooner have it quiet and do 1 mpg less.
just used an online calculator and at 10000 miles per year the saving between a C rated tyre and a D rated is about £30
"Can I ask what PSI you have in your front tyres to get 15k out of 21"" P Zeros?I was mortified to find that after about 3/4k miles I'm down to 5.1 MM and 5.4 mm! I really don't drive that fast, no idea why theyve worn so quick. I do travel down windy back roads to work but never experienced tyre wear this quick."
"I get about 12K out of my 21"" P-Zero's, not sure of the PSI as Costco fill them for free with Nitrogen and I never touch them."
"My car's on 18k, got winter's last year so the Pirellis have probably done about 15 - 16k, just passed it's mot with 3.4mm remaining. I stick with suggested plate pressure settings (for minimal load), 33 front and 29 rear.In the market for new rubber soon, Costco are doing the new Goodyear SUV (£100 off 4 this month, so comes to £212 a corner) or maybe wait for their next deal on Michelins."
"I hate to say this but but the Michelin Latitudes I had from new (20"") lasted at least 40k before being changed at about 3mm all round. I did swap them front to back every year when the winters came off (the 40k doesn't include the miles done on the winters - another 20k-ish)."
Think i only checked them a few times at around 33psi. Since changing to Dunlops on the front i am still using 33. Keeping front and rear the same just for ease. Also it gets driven quite hard when i am home and softly by the wife when i am away.

Hi guys - surely the answer to most of these enquires are in the owners manual?
Does anyone know when the face lifted Q5 is due in the show room?
I think I saw somewhere it was going to be around September.
Guessing late 2020
I was looking to replace my Q5 with a face lifted version soon as mine will be 3 years old in March. So was hoping for spring/early summer arrival of new model. Cannot get much info from local dealer at the moment.
"That's a shame! If you want to wait, I would add another 12 mths.Guessing order books will open late 2020 for delivery in early 2021."
"That's my fear, especially with my current Q5 continuing to depreciate between now and when the new model is available. I am in the fortunate position to buy my car without the need for pcp etc. The cost to change will just increase every month the longer I have to wait for it."
Agreed.Once released try & get an order placed/ part ex price agreed.

"Hi All,Just looking at the MOT history for our Q5. At Last year's MOT, there were advisories of all 4 ""front upper suspension arm (pin or bush) worn, but not resulting in excessive movement"". Just curious; is 30K miles all I can expect out of these? The bushes on my old CRV were still going strong at 105K miles. I spoke to the warranty manager at my local Audi dealer and she said that the Q5 and Q7 are big, heavy cars that put a lot of strain on these joints. Whilst she thought 30K was a little low but it was not uncommon to replace them at this mileage.Any of you lot had them replaced at similar mileages?Thanks,B"
"Worn, does not mean replace.Any moving part will wear overtime.Unless there is excessive play/ MOT failure. I would leave as is."
I would have thought it uncommon to have to replace the joints at such a low mileage.Yes it is a heavy car and I suppose some drivers could by driving manners cause early wear. This is more likely the case. Currently it only warrants monitoring unless it is causing knocks or giving adverse body control or steering effects.Do you have a friendly mechanic who could double check? Some mot garages are not totally reliable....

Article from last year on logistical issue Audi and VW face in mexico.Explains a lot about the long waiting times for delivery of the Q5 after production and why you suddenly lose all tracking of delivery!https://automotivelogistics.media/intelligence/volkswagen-audi-mexico-part-3-building-extra-level-efficiency

"We bought an A3 on Audi PCP (company car); at the end of the term the ""guaranteed"" future value was anything but (trade in value was way lower than promised despite only doing 36k miles rather than the 70k plus we had originally estimated). Never, ever again!"

Hi and good evening.Just purchased my second Audi Q5 which is a 2019 Sport 40 TDI Quattro.My previous car had the front and rear sensors with the car displayed on the full screen. No rear view cameraThis one has a rear view camera and while it still has front and rear sensors the picture of the car now only covers 25% of the screen'Does anyone know if the rear camera can be rear camera display can be disabled leaving just the car showing on the full screen. Have tried settings but no joy.Thanks.John
Can't speak from experience but when this has come up before the VAST majority of people recommend buying an iPad and the headrest mount for it.Cheaper and more versatile.Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"I thought as much, i've seen rigid mounts that attach to the back of your headrest and they had an attachment for an ipad or dvd player.The nextbase click and go stanchion looks great.http://www.nextbase.co.uk/products/Stanchion-Mount-%28Click-%26-Go-Series%29.htmlThanks."
"Does look pretty good, but only works with the one type of DVD player. I still say better going with an iPad as you can use that for 1 million different things, and you can still plug it into the 12v for long journeys and stick a film on it - I wandered if Audi did an official one - they do, but it only works with the rear seat entertainment system!! Hilarious!https://shops.audi.com/en_GB/web/zubehoer/p/ipad-adapter-for-ipad2-4g0063747b-10?articleId=51128"
"I bought a Toucoul iPad mount for the kids, excellent product. Got it shipped direct from the US.http://toucoul.com/products/coulvue-new-ipad"
"I have had alpine rear seat entertainment in my last two q5s and its been fitted on my knew SQ5 which has arrived at last but as I am in France so will have to wait,I have attached a link to the Q5 I am selling at the moment with pictures of ithttp://www.seymourpope.com/car-details?id=sv0iyjnq3uIt's excellent and was fitted by the dealer before collection and was £1800"
"The site i posted earlier supplies a rigid ipad mount to allow for watching movies and charging, it looks really good."
"As Tricky says, the Nextbase system is very good.I've (or should I say the kids) have used 2 DVD players on quality headrest mounts for almost 5 years without issue - they can operate either independently (2 films / 2 monitors) or can be linked (1 film / 2 monitors) through use of a simple lead - supplied.Price-wise, I think it came in at about £600 all told - includes wireless headsets, chargers, 12v supply leads and auxiliary batteries for out-of-vehicle use.Considerably cheaper than the Audi version, and little different."
"I've had the audi system fitted in my Q7, £950 a couple of years ago so I imagine it's the same system as the one being offered for the Q5. It's not something I would have specced by choice, but it was a showroom car and not negotiable. I did use it a bit however; decent quality sound and pics, plays dvd and cd's, both screens (and entire fixing unit) are detachable with chargeable batteries which can be charged from the mains as well as by the car - essentially portable dvd players with stands. Still got them in fact.Quite versatile, compared to for example the xc90 version built directly into the front headrest. I was always hanging fleeces over them to cover them up."
We just use two surfaces or iPad on seat back mounts.the surfaces actually work better for movies due to the size ratio..
I put xtrons 9inch DVD players built into headrests in mine very easy install

"Just saying a regretful goodbye to the forum, at least for the time being.I've had Astons, xc90 's, Q7's but the SQ5 has been my favourite of them all; apart from requiring a new gearbox under warranty no issues and a perfect all-rounder for me, so it's with massive regret I've handed my 2016 SQ5 diesel back to VW.And this forum has been one of the best I've been on. Friendly, knowledgeable, full of useful stuff. as a Q5/SQ5 owner I've picked up (and hopefully returned) tips, tricks and the odd purchase over the years which has let me stretch the capacity of both cars.Bye for now, thanks and good luck,Dave."

Picked up the car today after getting the Adblue tank replaced and the brake servo too ( no clanging noise). Also got the rear wheel arch trim replaced too ( seemingly there was a recall on that as well!!) As a goodwill gesture I received £150 which was decent.

I've got a Tesco petrol station right near me so it's convenient. I had to fill up with Sainsbury's 97 octane once and didn't notice much of a difference. There are some that say it makes no difference but for the extra few ££ a tank it's worth the bit extra IMHO.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
It will normally take three or four tanks of a particular fuel before a car will begin to show any difference.The ecu needs time to react.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"I agree I have used super unleaded for the last 4 tank fulls and all of a sudden my mpg has risen, particularly noticeable on the shorter day to day trips I’m doing. I will certainly continue using the higher octane petrol."
I was of the opinion when using super unleaded on my Golf GTI that the intakes coked up less (the GTI suffers badly from intake coking).Maybe wrong.............but only super unleaded goes into my TSI as a similar engine type.
"In my 2018 SQ5 i use 95ron BUT only from the likes of Shell,BP,Esso,Gulf etc."
Yes! Comes from the same refinery or storage facility as everyone purchases from. Different companies use different additives. Many years ago I was the RAF oil/fuels analysis laboratory specialist that used to batch test fuels as well as oil spectrometry on helicopter transmission/ gearboxes. There is no difference with any of them except that they use different additives per tanker load for who ever is having the fuel delivered.I met a tanker driver last year who was filling up the Gulf station down the road from us. He said his next load and he showed me his delivery schedule was going to be ASDA. Later on he was filling up Sainsburys at Oxford.
"My car has the above & since the car was returned from Audi after some warranty work i noticed when cleaning the seats the other day that there is some very slight scuffs on the drivers seat bolster.

It’s certainly a sweet running engine. I’m regularly getting 38-40 mpg when not in dynamic mode.
+1 to the above....best engine for the Mk2 Q5 IMHO.
"Fabulous engine, it is quiet, efficient and refined, and when you enter Sports Mode it growls and accelerates fast.I had initially ordered a Diesel, but I'm so glad I switched to this Petrol engine after much deliberation before finalising my latest Audi Q5 which I have had for nearly 4 months now and I am loving it.It leaves any other 2L SUV at the lights - literally."
"My 1 year old Q5 2.0 d S line with 10k miles, ""says"" it doesn't need a service for about another year.However the dealer says it does.Who is correct?"
Both are correct. Service interval depends on user profile. If you do a lot of short town journeys service interval is 12 months / longer journeys is mileage dependent or every 2 years
"I bring my car every 10K: for me, that is once a year."
"Sachdog,I suggest the car knows best, as Missile says, it depends on the user profile, the car knows this .... the dealer doesn't!Have you thought about getting a second opinion and quote from another dealer or from a good independent garage.

Hi. I am looking to buy another Audi Q5. Nice car just 6 months old.Bottomm line is that they have offered me the finance package. That means that I get £1k off of the car and two free services. What he says is that I could make the first monthly payment and then pay up the balance in full. That what I keep the £1k off and also keep the two free services. Has anyone done that please.Thanks.John
Sorry. When I say 'he' I mean the salesperson.
Hi - is that a PCP deal you are getting into ? If you can pay off the full amount in a certain time ( really quick ) then you keep the bonuses discount and service agreements etc. But I would be looking for more than a thousand pounds off their list price though.
The salesman saw you coming
"I would have thought around 10% off the advertised price is good starting point in negotiations. The dealer is getting a good deal out of this transaction. He gets all the backhanders and commision because you will have taken the finance, so this gives him a fat profit. Just bear that in mind before signing on the bottom line."
oops a duplicate!

Yes thanks for the info been checking tyre prices as doing around 500 to 1k a week at presentPirelli £220Dunlop £258Continentals £236not to bad me thinks
The Dunlops would be worth the price premium... what brand of tires did your SQ come with?
pirelli al round
"Pirelli seem to have come as standard on a lot of 21"" equipped SQs, starting of from new with just 5.5mm of tread so the are 1/3rd worn to start with (the 20"" Goodyears have nearly 10mm when new) and then being very soft wear very quickly."

I was sure on my TT it was like that and i was sure that i rotated tyres once so the wear was more even then changed all 4 but that was 12 years ago lolzMaybe after 8k swap them over ?

"After 2.5 years ownership I'm averaging 28s , but am very heavy footed ????"
"Do some of these apps maybe use global data, thats the only way I can think of 20mpg being quoted, the US petrol guzzling SQ5s will bring the averages right down."
I have averaged 30.2 to 30.8 over last couple of measured full tanks. My in-car data says I'm averaging around 32.5 so not a million miles out.
"Hehee mine is probably the 38mpg you mentioned. Which is mainly due to motorway driving and a route I know very well and good use of economy mode. I typically get around 40-50mpg on the dash. Fuelly used to report 40 but it's dropping each time, as my foot gets tempted more often, plus winter diesel is less economic. So it may rise in the Summer if I haven't decimated it by then.Fuelly allows you to sort by car type and region and year etc so you can remove all the US mpg stats from you searches."
"Drove home from Surrey to Yorkshire on Tuesday. All motorway (M25, M1, M18, M62) and the on board display was showing an average of 42mpg. Not bad for a twin-turbo V6 tdi. Much better than my S3."

My last two fills by hand calculation is about 25mpg mostly round town and a heavy right foot!
"I'd never heard of Fuelly so just went and checked it out. As SteveMak suggests it's vital to select the engine type - out of the box, it shows an average of 24MPG but when you select the 3.0D instead of the petrol it shows a spread from 27 to 40MPGView attachment 8297"

I've just hit 4100 miles in 7 months and still getting around the 25. Still mainly around town with a heavy right foot and on a run up to the 40 mark. At the same time I don't really care about the mpg for the millage I do. A quick calculation comparing it to my last car (VW Tiguan 2.0tdi) I was getting around 30 round town so for 4100 miles I'd have spent about £850 on fuel vs £1000 in the SQ5+ so it's only cost about £22 a month extra in fuel but well worth it for the smile in my face ????
As above still hitting around 33/36 mpg actual.Rappy.
I have measured maybe 3 tanks in my almost 3 years of ownership and have not been below 29 mpg and have been as high as 35 mpg when it's been mostly motorway miles.

I’ve averaged 30mpg over 20000 miles on my petrol SQ5.
Only just got mine but got 32mg out of my tank which I'm very happy given that 90% of that was just local drives to work. (Only 6mpg less than my 2.0 SMax yet a whole load more fun)
They once had a piece on Top Gear that said it was cheaper to courier the bikes separately than to have them on the roof.
"For sure cheaper than hiring the bikes from there, they must make a killing. Had to hire a bike for my wife and something like 32 quid for the weekend. Quick calculation over the 200 miles it only used an extra 4 ltrs so only a fiver more. Maybe on much longer distance it would be cheaper to courier them"
"Would have been difficult to carry 50 bottles of beer, 4 ltrs of gin, 2 ltrs of jack + mixers all the food and even the clothes!!!1"
Really? Does anyone believe anything Clarkson says?
No! He says things to make sure he gets the attention he thinks he should get. Makes for controversy and debate and argument.
So this has now appeared on YourAudi. Does this definitively mean it has shipped from Emden? Or post the refresh of the website does it now mean it's actually left Veracruz? Went Status 30 on 19th April.
"38 is at the port awaiting shipping to the UK,39 on the boat40 UK side60 Transit to dealers"
Mine reached UK in about 10 days after port of Exit Emden
Went to Status 39 yesterday so seems some movement
"I am not seeing any of these status numbers on ""MyAudi"". Is there something I am not doing?Sorry, I meant ""YourAudi"""

Almost three months to go from status 30 (leaving Mexico) to status 39 with nothing in between!
I bet you can't wait!
Great news. Post some pics. I tried but some functionality error.
Car arrived at Dealer and collecting Tuesday.
"Hi Wuls bet you don't get much sleep from now till Tuesday lol. I went out and bought a new snowfoam lance,noodle mits (to prevent swirls) one mit for the bodywork and a different couloured one for underneath the door sills, wheel arches,under exhaust area and under front grille. I also got a new noodle mit for the wheels. New microfibre drying towels and new polishing cloths. The worst bit is sitting looking at all this new kit while waiting on your car to use it on lol. Great news and enjoy your car next Tuesday"
Mines been at status 30 since 20th April.
Collecting on the 29th June

"I ordered it blind having had a number of Q5's previously. Trouble is there are a couple of features that have changed that make it less than perfect for my specific requirements; the boot being higher and with a lip, and the seat bucket being higher further forward. Yes I am looking forward to the new car - who wouldn't - but hope that these two features don't spoil it for me."
"Picked my Q5 TFSI up on Wednesday finally. I've had a TDI Sport as a loaner so am familiar with the car now. I have to say that a fully loaded Q5 has a different feel and look to a more basic model and perhaps is why people have been disappointed. The TFSI has Nappa, extended upholstery and the interior feels a luxury SUV whereas the Sport with twin leather just didn't.Whether you should have to spend like that to get a proper luxury feel is a different debate obviously."
Did you get the s-line? Would like to see some picsHope you enjoy your new car. I got the TFSI s-line and so far am getting c. 35mpg average so happy from this perspective as wellSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

"Yes the Sline with 20"" wheels. will post pictures early next week."
"Well surprise surprise, had it confirmed it went to Emden and then took 3 days to get to Grimsby. Have now completed the paperwork and expect to collect it early next week.Apparently orders placed now are forecast to take 9 months for delivery so very pleased I placed my order at the end of February!"
Hi TGR glad you're enjoying your car. Good to know they seem to be getting on top of issues raised with earlier cars.
Hi I bet you can't wait!
Hello All - just wondering whether anyone has had the emissions update applied during their service If so any noticeable difference / problems. Thanks Mark.
"Thank you for the feedback- I’m sorry to hear that. I guess you could always try an aftermarket remap, but hardly a satisfactory state of play ????"
"SteveMak said:This Dieselgate ""fix"" update has two truths:My car is much worse than it used to be..As far as I my research has shown, there is no cost-effective alternative for me.I kept my last two cars for 15 and 18 years respectively. Well maintained, long lasting, so I depreciation didn't matter to me. If I want to get rid of this 3.0L diesel Q5. the cost of getting into something else is prohibitive. Also, I'm not inspired by anything else, short of the new Cayenne Hybrid (CAD$130K configured as I want), which is nearly 3x the price of my Q5 when new. And try getting a lower cost per mile, or lower fuel consumption (emissions) in a similar vehicle. Where I live, diesel costs less than regular gas, and premium gas is about 15% more expensive, without offering 15% better fuel economy than my diesel.So my car is a lot worse than it used to be, but there's no practical alternative for me. Money no object, I'd get the Cayenne Hybrid, and I'd have about 1/2 of diesel's best highway cost-per-mile while driving in town (using the alleged 40km EV range). I'd also have a more luxurious vehicle, and not be limited by EV range or charge stations. I like the Cayenne, overall, though not as comprehensively as my Q5 when new. Yet the Cayenne's highway travel would cost substantially more (and have much higher emissions) than my diesel.We live in an imperfect worldClick to expand...Probably time to get a remap, and get it back to normal, worth every cent.."
But your manufacturers warranty has or is about to end...
"To date, there is no emission fix or in Audi speak campaign for the SQ5."
"Hi Raphster,Guessing date flash was added?? Not sure VCDS would show this.My SQ5 is remapped & will be flashed back to stock come service time.I can only echo the above. My last diesel & back to petrol. RS4 Avant next year. As for mpg, I'm guessing 10mpg less vs my SQ5 Plus :-(.Rappy."
X2. Mine is a late 66 plate SQ5 Plus & no updates for my car.Rappy.
"Seems like Mercedes will also be subject to emissions updates, meaning they will also be 'regenerating"" more.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/cars/article-5831783/German-ministry-says-774-000-Mercedes-cars-contain-unauthorised-software.html"
"4 year 80,000 km standard warranty. Getting the ""fix"" extends emissions components to 10 years. Remap voids warranty now.Also noting that I excelled at Physics in school, I don't believe in a free lunch. Chippers' claims to give you more horsepower, more torque and with less fuel are grossly misleading. And trust them that nothing will harmed. You can bet they have anecdotal evidence on their website. Written guarantee with a 10+ year history of proven delivery and no blow-ups... that's a different matter. Caveat emptor."
"When they say emissions components, what is included in the 10 year warranty, is it in writing."

"Mine shows the same message i.e.A-Reducing diesel emissions* followed by XXXX.

As no such code is displayed (I presume that is what the XXXX field is) I have assumed no update is required: I have confirmed that twice this year with my local dealer ............................"
Dream on andeat my dust
"Bloody funny, cough, cough."
Yes mine also showed the code xxxxIf that means it's not required why even flag the message up. Hard not to be a little disappointed in the Audi 'experience' at present.
"Mine went in at the start of the month for the Aux Heater fix, I told them I had taped up the OBD port and didn't want any updates doing as mine is mapped."
What was there response?
No problem Sir and bright pink writing across my paperwork. I know I've now voided what warranty I have left (drivetrain) but the car is a lot more enjoyable since the remap and my philosophy is you've gotta pay to play.
My car was in for a hill hold assist issue 2months ago and I said I don’t want the update done. They say no update for mine yet. Mines a late 2016 SQ5+ if that makes any difference.
"I foolishly (potentially) had my 65 plate updated two weeks ago (21st) during the major service... A week later and 1,000 miles further, I've the emission warning light on, 600 (now 400!) miles until the engine will not start again and according to a mate's diagnostic tool, a P20E8 low reductant error - pump pressure is low.The car is in with Audi now and I'm awaiting the bad news.It's the timing of the failure so close to the software update that irks me..."
Any update?

"Thanks guys, very helpful ????"
Hi JamesSQ I have the MK2 Q5 petrol. The roof bars I got with the car measure as follows.The width of the base of the slot (as per your diagram) is 21mm. The height of the slot is 5mm. The gap at the top of the slot is 11 mm.These are exact as I can measure and would suggest making your bracket 20mm at the base - 4mm for the slot hight and 10mm for the gap at the top. I take it the bars are the same for the SQ and the standard Q ? Hope this helps get your brackets made. Cheers
Justanhonestman thanks for going to the hassle of getting the measurements. I guess the bars will be the same for SQs and Qs as its the same body although I have a mk1 but I wouldn’t expect Audi to change the sizing too much it will prob be a slightly different width and attachment bracket. Anyway thanks again I’ll get fabricating soon!
I'm sure I've read somewhere (on here?) that the bars for Mk1 and Mk2 are the same??
"Anyone on here had their car serviced on the variable service pattern? My SQ5 is due it's first service at 19 months / 19k miles. First quote I got (from Watford Audi) was £515..... I've heard of people getting much cheaper prices but wondered what the experience on here was....Planning to ring a few other places to get a price so any one wants to name somewhere cheaper and good, please do!"
"Hi,I have never paid that much to service my SQ5. I would shop around. Audi do advertise a price match. I did use it and negotiated a discount on tyres."
Some dealers will price match other VAT registered service and repair centers in the area. In Lincoln there are 2 very good independent Audi specialists (just Audi VW & LInvoln Volkswagen specialists) so Lincoln Audi have to price match to complete.
My local Audi dealer flatly refused to price match my local VAG Indy even though there was a sign sitting right behind the service advisor advertising it.
"I am happy that they are more than an Indy, but not sure that the price quoted is anything like sensible. Hears someone say they had been quoted £280 for a similar service - but only done 10k miles in 18 months. That seems more sensible for what is essentially an oil and filters change as far as I can see....Will ring a few more this week, happy to travel if I can get a better price as not keen on using Watford if they suddenly drop the price by hundreds to price match!"
"Well rang another place - more like £530!!It seems that on a variable interval setting, 19k miles is a major service even if it is the first time your car sees a garage. So my major oil and filter change, pollen filter and a road test and check is 3 hours of labour at over £100 an hour...."
"Not a major, minor.Pollen filter is optional, at 10k oil & filter is plenty. Your next will be a major.My SQ5 had a minor last year. 2 out of 5 called, came up with some bull.From memory I paid just under £300.Rappy."

If you have a friend who works in Audi they can put you on friends and family and a £500 service goes down to £180!!!!
That's it then - Inchcape it is (even if its miles away...)
Can’t remember the exact figures but it was roughly 1/3 of normal price. Had mine done 6months ago when car was just over 2
"They do try and say you need this, this and that done. Apparently my rear pads are 70% worn and retail price is £600 ish. No thanks Audi"
"Seriously, £600 for rear brake pads?I'm going to stick with Indys from now on."
I had my rear discs and pads replaced for £427.50
"My Q7 rears were quoted as £255, wonder how the dealers dreamt up £600 figure. In fact I could have front and rears for just over £600 but if I wait two more weeks it'll be three and that would save another £150 on fixed price ????????"
Basic service was less than £250N.B. £20 puncture repair and Gold Service Pack £48 (including VAT)I have a good relationship with several of the staff.

The Q5 had a couple of recall items carried out hence the loan car. Got my oil in Tesco when it was on sale Castrol Edge Titanium FST 5w -30Highly recommend Perth Audi for customer care"
Hi guys - when I had my two year service the dealer used Shell Helix Ultra OW-30 fully synthetic oil. They tried to charge me £275 for the first oil change.
"Ready for a new set of tyres for the SQ5, 255/40 R21Y XL. Currently on Pirelli P Zeros which have worn really well. Oddly have managed nearly 25,000 on this second set compared with the first set which were buggered after 15,000. Looking on the internet I see Bridgestone do a Turanza tyre which has better fuel and wet weather ratings than the Pirelli's. Nothing in it price wise. Has anyone else bought these and what is your experience with them?"
"Hi SQ-cincoCan't comment on the Bridgestone's but I swapped my Pirelli's for Michelin's and haven't looked back. Much better in the wet, quieter and a smoother ride IMHO. Not sure how they compare price wise at the mo though"
"Agree with Richie, Michelin have just released the Pilot Sport 4 in the 255/40 r21, got a set fitted a couple of weeks back and really like them, quieter with a noticeably better ride than the Pirellis.Can't comment on the Turanzas but had a set of Potenzas on a Scooby once which I didn't like at all."
What is the rim protector like on the Michelins? tempted to try them but the PZero does have decent rim protection which comes in handy from time to time!
"Car was less than a month old when my beloved kerbed the FNS, first and (so far) last, thankfully - Pirelli rim 'protector' might as well have been made of cheese!Michelin's protector probably doesn't stick out quite so far but IMO it's a far superior tyre with better wear rate so that offsets the extra cost."
Thanks all for the feedback. Went to my friendly tyre supplier today and discussed options with him. The best news was that he said there was still a good 2000 miles of tread left on all 4 tyres - can't imagine the high street chains telling me that!!.The Michelins are about £15 plus VAT each more expensive but the advice seems to support Steve McB's positive experience so I'm going to switch to these from the Pirelli's.
"Google maps have announced that a new update showing local speed limits and the location of speed cameras with alerts is to be available within days according to the media. This is I assume to compete with the likes of Waze who already offer this service for free and although currently it is accessible using the Audi MMI system through CarPlay the map display using the MMI Google ""satellite"" map view I find to be better as are the audio directions. I was curious to know if anyone out there knew if this update would be available to the Audi MMI system through the on-line update service.Clearly this would be a much preferred option to using alternatives requiring downloads and adding to POI topics and that require regular offline updates."
I was prompted to do a map update a week or so ago and after the update speed cameras have appeared on the navigation map.
Was this an Audi map update you did for your MMI?
Has anybody else got the newspeed camerasto work via MMI???

The only indication that the lights are on is that the light switch back lighting illuminates, which is quite difficult to see when you're driving. Personally, I just leave my light switch in the Auto position and left the light sensor do its stuff.The lights will only come on automatically when they sense the external light level is low, which may not be the case if the wipers are working during very light rain, however, from my experience, my lights normally do Illuminate when it's raining.Hope this helps?Click to expand...It does help thank you.

How longs a piece of stringSo car is due to go in 4 mths & the tyre wear has been excellent!Fronts were changed last year & the rears still have circa 4mm remaining.From my rough calculations, I should get another 8/10k before they need replacing.Due to a few road trips, I estimate I will be covering another 6k, so should see me through.At what mileage & wear have your tyres been changed?Rappy"
I measured my tread depths on my Michelins at around 7.8mm with 52 miles on the clock and have been checking every few months. Current estimate of mileage to min legal limit is IRO 38k miles.
"Hi Rappy,Your calculations make sense to me and I would go with them.What are you changing to in 4 months, hope we're are losing you on the forum..Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
I have done 20k miles. Fronts were changed at 8k (sidewall damage to one tyre - bloody potholes!) and are still at 5mm per the Audi technician on service. Rears are at 3mm and are originals - but were on front originally until new ones fitted at 8k. I reckon they will get me round to 24k and then I will put new ones on for the winter.....Or I may swap it before then depending on if anything exciting comes my way!

"I took out the Audi warranty. So many stories about independent warranty company's not paying up. Bear in mind you'll probably need Audi recovery too, since most 3rd party recovery companies won't take you to the nearest Audi dealer, just a local garage.Russ"
"I would be interested in what you pay, even though mine is not due to expire for a while yet and it is a MK2 TFSI Sline 2.0 litre petrol.There is an insurer worth considering that is linked to the Civil Service Motoring Association (CSMA).

"When we purchased our 2016 plate SQ5 in January from an Audi dealership it was 2.5 years old with 15,000 miles on the clock. In addition to the 12 month standard warranty we added a further 3 years warranty for £899. It seems to be a very comprehensive warranty and includes breakdown assist and MOT test cover. We intend to keep the car and this seemed to me to be a good deal. Hoping that we don't need it!"
That seems a reasonable price. Very similar to prices for my 63 plate BMW xdrive 30d M Sport.

I'm interested in buying an extension to my current used warranty. Can I ask which dealer you bought the warranty from?
"Has anyone investigated trading in their Diesel SQ5 recently.I queried trading in my 2015 (64) SQ5 on 47k miles, only for a dealer to quote me a trade in value of 7k under what I paid for the car just 5 months ago.Do these cars really lose 25% of their value in just 5 months??"
Mine seemed to be dropping by approx £1k per month but it was high (and climbing rapidly) mileage ................
"Guessing you overpaid, and the price you are being offered is the trade price, not sale price.I got a great deal on mine & this includes the dealer paying money towards my new carRoll on September!"
"Depends on the options you have on it, but i guess you were bid around £22k?"
"As said, the price you paid included dealers mark up (£2k? Maybe a bit more). You are now getting trade prices at the worst time to sell, so soon after buying.If it makes you feel better, according to WBAC my petrol SQ5 bought new has lost £18k in 20 months...."

"I sold (px) my 14 plate SQ5 for a merc gla amg 17 plate a while ago, Got rid of merc after 4 months, not for me, to small, So thinking SQ5 again, But petrol or tdi ???"
"Yeah I suspect this, although did some homework before buying and similar cars with similar spec and mileage were the same price. However these same cars now, their sale prices are now much lower!"
"Not to my observation:There are currently two 2015 (64plate) £26,490 & £26,995 on Autotrader. That is very good residual value on a four year old car"
"Me too - a total of 20% off, a reasonable (not brilliant) trade in and £3.5k off by taking an HP loan that I paid off within the 14 day cooling off period (as suggested by the dealer)!"
"Values bounce around quite a lot on a month by month basis. Values generally climb around October and the colder months, so don't rule out your value actually increasing later in the year.Rest assured that your car won't continue depreciating at such a rate - if it does you'll have a queue round the block wanting to buy it. Lol.Just enjoy it - worrying will not affect its value in any way. Life really is too short ????"
They valued my SQ5 at 4.5k under the outstanding finance!
Maybe best to just keep it - refinance it yourself and enjoy it for a couple of years - the depreciation will level off a little then. Of course the Mk1 q5 is now looking a bit dated and I think pre 65 reg cars are getting hit a bit harder.
"That works for me.+++++++++++++If you want the latest tech ICE, have you considered replacing the MMI with an after market system? Even the best system would be only a fraction of the cost to replace your car?There are several posts from members who have done that."
"If the ""old tech"" really is a problem, have a look atRSNav.comfor a range of replacement Android screens that will integrate with your MMI.They have an enthusiastic following on a number of Audi forums and seem to be way ahead of the usual ebay/Alibaba sellers.Russ"
"The RS Nav kit looks great, but too much DIY work to do to a car that's still on finance."
"Not visited the forum for a while but found the need last night as I'm in a dilemma which I'd appreciate advice with.Have had a 2010 Q5 2l tdi sline manual special edition since new and it currently has 73000 miles. It's a brilliant car but I've seen a 2016 Q5 2l tdi sline auto plus with low mileage at a local Audi garage. This one has a Towbar and I'm a little concerned about the use it may have had. Also I think a couple of the alloys have slight kerbing. Pretty happy with the potential deal they are offering.Guess the questions I have are1. Should I change or stick with what I've got?2. Are these black/silver sline plus alloys easily refurbished?3. I have genuine 17"" audi winter wheels for my current Q5 but recall reading something a while ago that these won't fit a 2016 Q5, is this right?4.

Drive it first.
"Thanks for everyone's input. Think the wheels are very similar, if not the same as the SQ5.

According to them the owner hasn't used the Towbar but haven't spoken to the owner to confirm if that's the case or not, not easy getting owners details. Not a lover of the running boards so guess they would have to come off which I think should be pretty straight forward.Hopefully manage to get a run in it this week."

Modern caravans use a friction hitch which means that the towball paint has to be removed first. If the towball is unused, or has just been used for a small trailer or bike rack I'd expect the paint to be pretty much intact. If the paint's been rubbed off it's probably been used to tow a caravan.Even so it's no great drama, mine humps an 1800kg tin shed as if it's not even there."
Sounds like a good upgrade. You’ll most likely grow to love the auto as well (it’s the 8 speed tiptronic on the 2016 which is a brilliant box). Good luck.
I’ve noticed the short cut key numbers sometimes randomly appear on the mmi screen as though they are being touched and then disappear again after a few seconds. Any one else seen this? It appears to be some kind of glitch or fault. I’ve tried a reboot and factory reset but it continues to happen.
"Not seen this on my Mk2 Q5, so looks like you may have a glitch...time to visit your friendly Audi dealer!"
Took our 2016 sq5 plus in to Audi garage today for a service & first mot to be told it needed a software upgrade for the gearbox (by The girl on front desk ) when we started to question her the work shop manager came over and said the sq5 diesels are now part of the Emissions recall and everyone should be receiving letters in the next few weeks about the recall !! Just for reference we refused
"Mine is booked in to look into a noise from the rear diff and I was also informed about the emissions update. The girl however told me that it wasn't a recall which is why I hadn't been informed and that there are 2 updates it needs for emissions. Like you I will be refusing. It does every now and then, from cold, fire up on less than 6 cylinders which I wondered if the update would cure at the same time (no faults logged and not particularly bothered).I was also told there was a tpi instructing them to fill up the adblue - which I had literally just done!"
"We were told that many stories today by different members of staff that we rang Audi direct and they told us there is a software update to help with emissions another for the gearbox(which ours doesn't need & another for some sort of probe (which ours doesn't need either) ,Really not happy with dealer as they tried every excuse to try & get us to have it done but we got them to give us a letter stating it won't affect any warranty if we don't have it done to which they have given us one.Does anyone know when Audi are hoping to release the new sq5 Diesel yet ?"
"Just did the online check, apparently mine isn't affected?Won't be getting it done under any circumstances though."
Had mine in for service this month and it was confirmed there was not an emissions campaign for my SQ5.
What year is your Missile ?
The online check shows mine isn't affected (2017 8R model) - but as I understand it this is only for the recall. As mentioned earlier I was told this isn't a recall but a tpi. Either way i'm not having it.Missile's is 2013 by the looks of it.
Hi all just looked through paper work and the emissions campaign number is 23X6 which isn't live yet DVLA system yet but Audi said paper work should be out in couple of weeks.Hope this helps
"Seems I am too old to be ""improved"" SQ5 TDIof 313, 326 and 340 hp (2015-2017)​Seeherefor detailsYou can check if your Audi is affected, here>https://www.audi.co.uk/owners-area/emissions.html​​​​​​"
"Thanks Missile,Just double checked, and mine is not affected.66 plate SQ5 plus"
"Hi Rapport25Our sq5 plus is 2016 with Euro 6 engine and it's affected by this new campaign ,I've put my details in the above link & it's come up not affected but when I rang up Audi UK they said it's not fully live yet only Audi dealers know at the moment which is pretty crap really .From what Audi UK said all sq5 & plus with euro 6 engines will be affected but it's not legal to have it done at moment.Hope this helps ."
"Not an issue for me, as mine is going very soon.The next time mine will see a dealer, is when I get rid."
What car are you looking at getting this time ?
A6 Avant
I had mine done just before I got rid of it; software for gearbox and a NOx probe replaced. As far as I could tell it made no difference to performance or mpg ................
Just checked mine on the above link - not affected. 16 plate Euro 6 SQ5.We also own a 13 plate Skoda Superb 2.0 diesel which was affected by the VW emissions scandal. we eventually had it modified with no obvious change in power or MPG.
Good to hear that positive feedback
"Mine (65 plate Euro 6) also comes up with ""not affected"" yet it appeared on the dealer system as requiring doing???"
I couldn't find any suitable door rubbing strips for my new Q5. I had previously fitted rubbing strips to my wifes Citigo and they also looked to be a decent fit for the Q5.Helps to prevent getting dinged in tight car parks. I got these from Automotiva on Ebay.https://ibb.co/MGHQwyYhttps://ibb.co/S3kLb9S
"Do these protrude enough to prevent the car being ""dinged"" higher up the panels near the door handles?"
"How is it when you park in the furthest away empty corner in a supermarket car park, when you return there is always someone parked next to you?"
Tell me about it. I went to a stately home (National Trust) one weekday when it was not busy and I parked on the other side of the a very large 10 acre field. Two hours later we came back and found one other car there. Guess where it parked?No prizes for the correct answer.?
They protrude enough where I have placed (right on the line/crease of the doors) them to prevent drivers and passengers door from hitting my door. It is unlikely to help when an adjacent parked cars rear door is opened though.For the money I think it is worthwhile. On the Citigo it has certainly prevented the doors getting dinged.
There is the problem. My singing and dancing X3 xDrive 30d (F25) was dinged several times by people getting out of the rear doors. I am lucky enough to have a friendly guy who fixes these for a living and he removed the creases each time for about 30 quid a go. I was lucky the paint had not been damaged and the work was done such that you could not see where they had been creased.Similarly some 3 years ago he removed a hefty crease on the bonnet of my wife's Seat Ibiza that was damaged when a large heap of wet snow slid off my PV panels.
They are very smart J3.
They look nicer but are they any better than the SQ5 discs?
Couldn’t say for sure but I believe they’re half the price
"Hi all,I'm a few weeks into my SQ5 ownership now.Me and my dad have always had a bit of a laugh doing a best mpg challenge when we share a legnthy journey in a car.I managed to squeeze 58mpg out of 2001 Volvo V70 driving from Herts to Newcastle a few weeks back, compared to my dads meesly 52mpg on the way back.Having been through a few tanks of the premium stuff in the Audi doing a mix of motorway bashing and city start stopping, I've been averaging 21-26mpg a tank.

My best on a long run back from Liverpool to Surrey via Southampton was about 34mpg - car was still new and tight and I was driving sensibly...That is a new shape petrol SQ5 by the way.Long term average sits at 28mpg over 5360 miles. Many on motorways it has to be said. Lowest was a short trip to shop and school run - 11 mpg.....
my about town driving showing 32mpg average.
"Remember that indicated fuel economy is fiction. If you want to see other SQ5's fuel economy, visithttp://www.fuelly.com/car. Just as a data point, my best ever fuel economy was 4.54 L/100 km (= 51.81 MPG US = 62.23 MPG Imp) across 528 miles. On a 3,100 mile round trip with a 7,500 foot elevation difference, I averaged 5.1 L/100 km (= 46.1 MPG US = 55.4 MPG Imp). That's in a 2015 Q5 3.0 TDI."

I've tested my readout against brim to brim fills (subject to the inaccuracies of those if you get it slightly more or less full) - its not a million miles away so I just round the display down to nearest round number and take that as good enough...
"In my specific case, 4.2 L/100 km indicated translated into an actual 4.54 L/100 km. That's 8% more fuel consumed than indicated, which is not trivial. Translated into MPG, here's what you would see:MPG (US): 56 Indicated -- 51.8 actualMPG (Imp): 67.27 Indicated -- 62.23 actualSo obviously, each Q5's indicated fuel economy inaccuracy varies. That inaccuracy might also vary tank to tank."
"I have had five Q5's and the FC's have all been optimistic to varying degrees as follows over the period of my ownership:1. 3.9%2, 4.1%3. 5.8%4. 2.8%5. 1.8%"

"I understand that - it wouldn't be trivial if it mattered but to me it doesn't. I didn't buy it for the economy, I can afford the fuel it uses, I do a check on consumption as I fill it just to check all is ok with car.I used to worry about fuel consumption when I did 40k miles a year in a Merc E220d estate - glad not to be doing that now (or driving that car...)"

I personally do not take any notice of those tests because I fit Michelin. Tyres that are meant for cold weather (snow with mugs of coffee) are supposed to be more effective below +7 degrees centigrade. This does not mean they should not be used above this temperature.

Considering the differences between different makes of cross climate tyres on the market regarding stopping distances, wet and dry performance during cold and hot weather, handling etc etc. If you ever go ahead and buy cross climate tyres, what would influence your descision to purchase a certain make of tyre over another, taking into account the many differences between performance from each manufacturer as shown in the links you posted to the tests done by Auto Express."

It's part of the car and not an expensive extra, just a software update.Only downside is currently it's only the front camera and doesn't support parking mode."
Might be because dash cams are illegal in parts of Europe?
Footage from my BlackVue DR-650GW in the snow last month:
I have Blackvue 2 channel and they work a treat hardwired via the powermagic pro.21
Yes!https://www.clearcar...ash-cam-abroad/Some EU countries where dash cam use is legal:Bosnia and HerzegovinaDenmarkItalyMaltaNetherlandsSerbiaSpainSweden
That is surely a bit of a cop out?Audi can and do supply vehicles to meet the differing regulations in European countries.It would be easy to disable the function for countries where it is illegal to use a dash cam.
Get the part number(s) from the wheel and ask Audi. This assumes that they have not been refurbished and painted/sprayed.
On researching it seems that Audi Avus Silver is the colour i require. Cant remember the code. Such a small stone chip that it wont be seen much anyway.
Chipex make very good colour match touch up kits.

"Hi,I have seen, but yet to test drive a Q5 that I have been to view, 2015 Q5 S-Line 3.0TDI.I am looking for advice, I currently have a BMW 2013 330d M Sport estate.What is the MPG like?Any known faults I should be looking out for?MMI, does that stream audio?Thank you!"
"I ran one for a month whilst my 2.0 litre was in for repair on the AdBlue pump and took careful note of the fuel used. Overall it was around 10-15% worse than my car, but that additional power was quite addictive so I was definitely heavier with my right foot. However if I drove it the way I drove my car then the fuel consumption was pretty similar on a run. I was getting around 37mpg average on the 2.0 litre."
"I don't have a diesel, but I would say...The F31 3 series is not the last word in refinement so regardless of wheels / tyres on the Audi it should be noticeably more refined.SUV are not shaped for best economy and 4wd is a drain on efficiency..."
"Absolutely, the F31 isn't refined from road or wind noise, more so on the large 19"" wheels, but the 3.0 6 cylinder diesel does help!The main thing for me and the wife is a higher driving position, with a more airy feel inside the cabin, with good road and wind noise suppression.Thanks"

2018 SQ5 Each time put drive select into off road mode I get a message Audi pre sense limited. It disappears and does not happen in any other mode. Any info appreciated. Thanks
Hi - can only guess if you were going off road you may encounter hanging branches or other various obstacles which wouldn’t show up on a normal road or flat surface. The sensor may pick up these objects and slam the brakes on ruining your off road enjoyment. I understand the sensor is calibrated towards normal road driving where you could encounter pedestrians on the road or cars stopping suddenly in front of you.

Hello. Am I correct to think that the flat bottom steering wheel is thicker than the round one?Thanks Mark.
"yes,"
Thanks ????
It's also the same wheel that is fitted to other models across the Audi range as I fitted the one from my S3 that I'd had retrimmed in Alcantara. Was a straight swap
Was it straightforward to swap over? Thanks
"Yes, although it takes a little practice to ""pop"" the airbag off from the clips.It helps if you have a wheel to look at and then you can understand the removal a bit easier.You are advised to disconnect the battery but I never have.

"Hi,In the previous four Q5s I've owned the heated seats, when set to their highest setting - three bars, would automatically step down in power if left on full. That is, if turned on full to three bars, they would automatically step down to two bars, then one bar. My current Q5 does not do this and the heated seats have to be turned down manually. This seems to be a step back. Can anyone with a current Q5 confirm that this is the case?Many thanks."

Megs Ultimate Polish. Finish with Megs Fast finish.Rappy
"I use Autoglym Super Resin polish. Used to seal it with their Extra Gloss Protection but now use their High Definition wax. Seems to keep the crap spewed out from a nearby factory at bay, making the car easir to keep clean. Lots of different products to choose from to suit your location. Also depends if your willing to re wax 2 or 3 times a year or pay mega bucks to have the surface sealed but requires a top up once a year according to the manufacturer I checked out. Plenty time on my hands , so I stick to the polish/ wax."
+1 The Autoglym products seem to work fine for me (I did have their Lifeshine applied for delivery) .................
"+1 for AG products especially SRP, easy to apply & remove + keeps my mythos metallic looking great.Even better if you decontaminate surface first with clay."

"Hi all. I am debating whether to change my SQ5 tdi for the new model. One factor is mpg, although in truth my mileage is only around 8000 per year.My current car averages just about 31mpg. Just wondering what I would expect from the new petrol model.Thanks mark."
"I have had my petrol SQ5 for a year and over about 10,000 miles I have averaged about 28 mpg. Probably half my mileage is very short local trips of a few miles each time, and then the rest decent long runs."
That’s great. Thanks for the replies.
Go take one for a test drive and see for yourself. If you only get 31mpg in a diesel SQ you won't be getting anywhere near that in the petrol SQ!
"Hi All,Had the car 1 week, and the rear wiper blade has disappeared... ahhhhhAny ideas what the replacement blade is for a 2018 Q5 ? I cannot find anything on sites (by search via the number plate) and the searches only go up to 2016.thanks"
Ask your Audi dealer. I asked my dealer to replace rear wiper blade at 1st service. I was surprised there was no charge
Disappeared?? Did some scrot nick it??
Yep seems like it
Very sorry to hear this....what a world we live in!? I'm sure Audi will have a replacement in stock.
"Just had full service and fronts at 40% but rears are 75%, that just doesn't seem right.Anyone one else had this issue ?Is it normal ?Also what prices have people paid for disc and pad change?My car is an sq5 plus my16Thanks in advance"
"Of course it's normal, look at the size of your front brakes."
.
Had to replace my rears. I wondered if the rear brakes are applied to limit over speed when on cruise control?
Wheels are stationary when electronic brake is applied.
"IME it's normal for front pads/discs to wear out quicker than the rears, as for how many miles OME should last, like tyres, there'll be variables but I reckon the main one is driving style."
I believe the rear brakes are applied automatically by stability control mechanisms to aid handling etc.I had same issue with a Freelander some years ago where the rear brakes were worn out but fronts were fine.Russ
That would make sense.
"Had my SQ5 in the dealership recently who advised my rear pads were 70% worn and their best price to replace them is £225. I received a quote from a local independent garage who use genuine Audi parts for £140+VATI have had the car since new, now 3.5yrs old and the first time I have been notified about the pads."
"Best to check they have measured it correctly. The first time mine went in (approx 1yr old with 19k on the clock) they told me the rears needed replacing; turned out the tech measured just the pad thickness and had not included the backing plate - when they calculate wear they include both pad and backing plate thicknesses. Since then, another 2 years and another 41k, the rear pads on mine are still acceptable."
How do you go about measuring the pad thickness? What thickness are they new?
I replaced the rear pads on my brothers 3.0tdi last weekend. It took around 20 mins per side and was pretty easy. Quite enjoyed it. He got special low dusk pads. All in all around £55 ????
Do you know which ones? As I hate brake dust getting on the alloys.
Got the car in next week to replace the pan roof frame so told them to check over the pads again as they have no known reason for the wear difference.Mileage is 37kAlso quoted that I needed pads and disc replacing at £531 ????
TRW DTEC - they definitely produce significantly less dust.The default Audi replace discs stance is money making at its finest ????
"Hi All, does anyone know if Audi Finance will accept a new replacement car in the 1st year.. as my insurance company offer new car replacement policy for the first year.Also, thoughts on Alloy Insurance.. especially Diamond cut.. I have read loads of reviews about rusting etc... and perhaps not the greatest thing to put on the car.. any recommendations on alloy insurance that covers Diamond cut.. or not ?"
"1. Why would they not?2. If you kerb wheels, diamond cut is not a good option. Alloy doesn't rust, it oxidises if the coating is damaged. Same would happen with a painted wheel. My nephew and niece are both young and careless and have had diamond cut replaced / repaired under Audi wheel insurance."
"Hi All,Just wondering if anyone has had this done yet to their Q5. Fed up of careless people leaving dings and scrapes on the Q5,Best quote so far has been £499 for front and rear, now see this as an option on configurator.Thanks"
"I have Thinkware front and rear. It has already saved me more than the cost. Whilst parked, my car was damaged by a hit and run driver.

The footage was good enough for the police to identify her and my insurer to claim against her policy.There are reviews fromAudi Universal Traffic Recorder Front and Rearowners on line"
Thanks all. I assume the fit has been done well. Just nervous that will encounter squeaks after the work has been done.Yes definitely thinking of investing as no one has left me notes on my car in two incidents so far. Love to catch them on cam!
Don't leave home without one. Make sure you fit cameras with parking mode function before you park.
"I have a Thinkware Dual Dash Cam F770 like missile, and I wouldn't drive without a dash cam either. But I think dash cams should be like any other option when you config your order, and they should be properly integrated into the car, not an add on to the mirror etc. Should just be a lens built into the back of the mirror housing etc, and configurable from MMI etc."
"Agreed. It is high time manufacturers included a quality dash cam as a standard fitment integrated into the MMI. It would be so much nicer to have a discreet cameraintegral with the mirror. Audi can do that for rain sensor, auto mirror dip and high beam assist. I could easily live without those nice to have options andwould rather a dash cam."
"It would really be nice to integrate my Qvia AR790 WD - 2CH Dash Camerahttps://lukashd.co.u...ch-dash-camera/into the MMI, I can see there would be real benefits in reviewing footage when someone had damaged my car by running into it when it was parked. Although I do have the app on my Android for quick viewing."
Just wondering what peoples thoughts were on fitting these.I'm not sure I like the look of them but can see they make accessing a roof box etc. a bit easier?They are pretty dear to get fitted (£1250). Has anyone got them or have thoughts to share?Thanks Mark
I had them fitted to help my 3 year old daughter get in and out safely. To me they give the car a bit more of a road presence. I had mine supply and fitted for £300.
I got them on my new car and they are handy for the kids but a pain for me as they don't really make a difference to me but its the kids who love it
Do you have photographs of your vehicle with them fitted?

"Not quite the same, but I have just moved from owning a BMW xDrive 30d M Sport (coming up to 5 years old) to a very low mileage 8 month old Q5 SLine TFSI. My considerations were the downwards pressure on prices of older large diesels and the current trend of people looking (not always buying) at cars with more efficient petrol engines.I have found that my 2.0 litre TFSI engine is a lot quieter and pulls very linear during acceleration and my fuel consumption is comparable with my outgoing BMW. My short term average is 34 mpg with the long term of 37 mpg. Although it is early days yet."
"They're quite different.As an owner of a last model sq5, I'd say go for that. I've remapped mine and, as an example, at the weekend I drove from the south coast to Hertfordshire and got an indicated 42 mpg.

"Took the petrol out yesterday. Around town it gave 23mpg - bit disappointing, but not horrendous. It was exceptionally quiet, nippy rather than quick and unfortunately soulless. I guess that euro 6 diesels will be safe for some time to come, but certainly the publicity ain’t great. My local Audi dealer is still selling more diesel than petrol q5’s so it’s all a bit confusing. Thanks for your thoughts."
Just bite the bullet and get a petrol SQ5...
"been attempting to build a new SQ5 but of course the website has shut down any build configurations, so looking at 2018 stock cars which can be had at some considerable discount, but would you buy one!the current fleet of 2018 SQ5 will not meet the latest emission regulations, which is why they are not building any more SQ5`s at the moment, the ""new"" modified engine will have a petrol particulate filter installed which will reduce the engine power by at least 4%, therefore I am assuming Audi are working on raising the engine power of the current SQ5 354PS engine to compensate.I am willing to wait and see what Audi release, with Porsche already announcing an entry level Macan with a 4 cylinder 2 litre engine with around 310PS and even more powerful V6 engines coming as well, will Audi follow suit?with the above in mind I believe that the old stock of new SQ5 models will be lemons and would have to be sold at a loss by Audi to make way for the new ""lower emission engine"" model.Anyone got any additional thoughts?"
If you really want the petrol SQ5 it might be sensible to buy one now before it gets those power sapping emission control add ons. Unless you are a tree hugger?

"If you can live with the poverty spec / money is no object and can afford the horrendous cost of Porsche options, the Macan is a good choice."
"Don't know, the GTS has a decent standard spec but admittedly it's still easy to get into the high 60K bracket."
I originally ordered a Macan GTS - worked out £10k more expensive over 4 years (excluding Porsche tax on servicing and parts) assuming both were worth balloon at end of agreement.To me it wasn't worth the extra. Especially as the colour choices were dull....and I still wasn't 100% happy with the spec but had reached my self imposed cap (65k)
"SteveMcB said:Porsche residuals are better though, after 4 years it will likely be worth over 10k more than the Audi so could actually work out cheaper.Certainly the case comparing 16 plates, Macan GTS start mid 50s, SQ5 start low 30s so if I had paid the extra 13k a nicely specced GTS would have cost me then I'd be about 10k better off now - and have a Porsche.With the facelift coming out soon not so sure how the used prices of Mk1 Macans will stack up against Mk2 Sq5s though.Click to expand...The £10k difference assumed both cars were worth gfv at 4 years old - with Porsche c £4K higher.

Cheapest GTS I can see is a private sale at £53.5K? Reason I picked 2017 is to compare against used petrol SQ5s.Fair enough about the running costs but don't expect there would be a massive difference TBH.

If I understand those figures correctly (which I probably don't?) all I can say is that whoever did the sums doesn't know much about the auto trade, you're looking at £17k minimum between the 2 on a 17 plate and that gap will only get bigger.Click to expand...I am senior enough for people to expect a decent car, not so well paid that I want them to think I earn too much, if you get my drift. I also have a private plate - well, it is my sons and he currently doesn't have a car to put it on. Sort of spells my name which means people can spot my car, discretion to a point therefore important.GFV for audi set by Audi FS. GFV for Porsche set by Porsche. I imagine one is more prudent than other but can't prove either yet!Porsche servicing is fairly expensive by anyone's standards but the courtesy cars are fun!"
"Your sample is far too small to accurately compare residual values Macan v SQ5Have you ever owned a Porsche? ........... those of us who have, find dealer servicing costs expensive, as per the link in my post."
"If you did not feel the petrol SQ5 lacking in performance, then I expect you will be underwhelmed with anything less than the Macan Turbo. I have a C class Merc as a courtesy car and can't wait to give it back."
"been attempting to build a new SQ5 but of course the website has shut down any build configurations, so looking at 2018 stock cars which can be had at some considerable discount, but would you buy one!the current fleet of 2018 SQ5 will not meet the latest emission regulations, which is why they are not building any more SQ5`s at the moment, the ""new"" modified engine will have a petrol particulate filter installed which will reduce the engine power by at least 4%, therefore I am assuming Audi are working on raising the engine power of the current SQ5 354PS engine to compensate.I am willing to wait and see what Audi release, with Porsche already announcing an entry level Macan with a 4 cylinder 2 litre engine with around 310PS and even more powerful V6 engines coming as well, will Audi follow suit?with the above in mind I believe that the old stock of new SQ5 models will be lemons and would have to be sold at a loss by Audi to make way for the new ""lower emission engine"" model.Anyone got any additional thoughts?"
"audiguru said:My 2014 SQ5 is coming up for 4 years old in NOV, need to plan to replace, hence the visit to the Audi dealership, as I mentioned previously Audi have heaps of 2018 model unregistered SQ5 available to purchase.Not too impressed with the new SQ5 coming from the Bi-turbo diesel with huge amounts of torque and approx. 35-40 MPG to a V6 petrol engine that needs to be revved and mid 20 MPG.What does Audi have to offer right now, I cannot build/spec the new car I want, so left with some models in a colour I may or not like, with a spec which may not be exactly what I am after, how long will it be before Audi opens up the website to allow new build orders?I love the SQ5 Bi-turbo, great package all round, the replacement petrol variant is not for me, so need to look at alternative options such as Porsche Macan, Mercedes GLC,etc,Not looking at the Porsche as some kind of status symbol, but merely as an alternative to the current bland Audi SQ5.Hopefully if Audi get their act together quickly and release an upgraded engine to meet the latest emission regulations then I may purchase another, but right now don't have this option.FYI, Audi at asking current buyers to sign disclaimers stating that their current model performance/fuel economy/emissions may change due to planned engine management/software upgrades, not exactly what you want to here after purchasing an ex stock 2018 model.Click to expand...Couldn't get any sense out of Audi, on my way to the dark side, 370 bhp BiTurbo diesel."
"Facelift Macan looks really good, no diesel though ( but it's the most popular Macan so I think they'll rethink that). 2.9 five pot from the Audi RS should be something."
I thought the 2.9 lump was still a V6!
"Still yearning for a SQ5 BiTurbo diesel, wish Audi would defo commit to this model."
"audiguru said:The issues I have with Audi at the moment is that they are not disclosing to potential buyers what they plan to do with the current model SQ5, if you cannot build a new car, and no more new SQ5 are available to order, then part of the Q5 assembly line must be at a standstill for re-tooling or some other reason connected to the SQ5 models.The short stroke 2.9 V6 engine is from the Porsche Panamera which will be fitted to the Macan Turbo S, the longer stoked 3.0 V6 engine will be fitted to the Macan Turbo, Porsche have announced the engine line ups for the New Macan, why cant Audi follow suit and announce the new engine line ups for the SQ5 or the RSQ5?Audi wont develop a brand new engine, they are committed to what is currently available within the VAG group which also includes Porsche, so why all the cloak and dagger stuff!Click to expand...To clear the existing stocks first..?Revised petrol SQ5 will be same engine in slightly different tune to do better in new tests, and with a petrol particulate filter fitted in exhaust..Will there be a diesel SQ5? That might depend on political manoeuvrings.....Will there be an RSQ5 - almost certainly, almost certainly with same 2.9 V6 found in RS4/5...."
"based upon current facts, it appears we wont see the revised SQ5 or indeed the RSQ5 until early 2019 at best!"
"Just been at our local dealer and they have 7 bright, shiny, new SQ5s on the forecourt!"
"There are plenty of unregistered current models around with as much as £6500 off list, but most of the best specced models have gone."
"Hi All, Just taken delivery of my new Q5 S-line after trading in my A6. Love the car and just about sussed out how to use the different tech packs after a bit of trial and error,A couple of questions...1. My last car had adaptive cruise control and did the stop-go thing when in queues, as does the Q5, but the Q5 has traffic jam assist that is also supposed to steer up to 40 MPH. Does anyone know how to activate it rather than the standard stop-go without the steering?2. There is no spare wheel with the car ( i subsequently realised that I should have bought a collapsible spare), but where the spare wheel would normally sit, there is a round plastic insert the same size as a wheel but with some sort of electrical connector attached. What is it?Thanks for any feedback."

Was it a factory order or just bought from stock ?I find it incredible that more than 3 months down the line I still have no idea when I'm getting the vehicleSent from my iPad using Tapatalk
"It was a factory order as there was nothing in stock that had the list of options I wanted. Still got the same discount as buying a stock car, but made all the sweeter by selling my A6 atWebuyanycar.comwho paid nearly £900 more than the part-ex price offered by Liverpool Audi when I placed the order."
"The button on the indicator stalk turns the traffic jam assist mode on and off.If you want to deactivate the system permanently, select the following on the MMIMenu> Car>left control button>Driver assist> Traffic Jam AssistWhen deactivated as above, active lane assist is still controlled by the button and traffic jam assist functions are no longer available. Use same procedure as above to reactivate the system"
Congrats on the new car ????????I find traffic jam assist one of the best features of the car - assuming you travel on a route with traffic that is.You need to have Lane Assist active which is via a button on the indicator stalk from memory. Then when in traffic just turn on the ACC and the car will set the speed to something like 20mph and literally move along and keep in lane - if you take your hands off the wheel for more than a certain period of time the car shouts at you and tells you to put hands back on the wheel.
"Nemo said:This could all be down to Audi retooling as such to make sure they are compliant with the new WLTP regulations.I spoke to Audi CS last week and they said that the order books as such are closed due to this and should reopen in the next couple of weeks.Now I know you've already ordered and potentially should see your car on the tracker at the 'Welcome' stage?

"Same as stated above. Most likely cabin temperature, very similar position to BMW sensor for cabin temp."
"Thanks guys......didn't think of a temp sensor, but this makes sense for controlling the auto climate control system."
Never even noticed I had one lol
"I assumed this was an ambient light sensor so it knows when to dim the sat nav screen. In other cars I've had there's normally two, so the trick of putting your finger over it to test it doesn't work."
Perhaps we should all test this?
I reckon Audi is watching you lol
Lol...you might be right there!!

Ambient light sensor is normally on the exterior (in the rear mirror module).
"Hi guys,I am going to look at a 2013 3.0TDI this weekend with 80k on th clock, full history and recent service and gearbox service too.I currently have a 2013 330d Touring, which for the power/size is great on fuel.My questions are really....How is MPG?What should I be looking,listening and checking for?What's overall reliability like?Many thanks"
"I can't speak for a 3.0TDi as I only have experience of the 2.0TDI but my wife averages the same in her Q5 as I get from my Mercedes C350 (so similar to your 330D) which is 39mpg. Given BMW diesels tend to be very good re MPG you are going to see a reduction when moving to a Q5 3.0Tdi of that there is no doubt. It's a bigger heavier car with more parasitic loses through the drive train than your BMW, so this is perhaps not surprising.Out of interest why are you swapping? Do you need more space"
"Worth noting. BMW 3.0 litre diesels do give excellent fuel consumption figures when in just rear wheel drive only cars, but drop back a little when in a 4 x 4 such as the heavier X3 3.0d. Mine used to give around 35 to 36 mpg overall."
"Search for SteveMak from Canada on this forum, he gets very good MPG out of his 3.0 TDi, but your have to hypermile to achieve. However you drive you will get less MPG compared to your BMW due to the facts already raised above."
Is there a way to set the windows to roll up and the sunroof to close simply by pushing lock on the keyfob?
You can enable it via VAG com I think. You need the cable and the laptop software there's a video on here somewhere.
Maybe my dealer set it up. But my windows close if I keep the lock tab down on my key. They close after the wing mirrors have folded in. I don't have a sun roof so cant comment on that point.
Should be a already available... Go toCar - SettingsWindows (bottom of list - off screan) - Convience OpenSet Front and/or Rear to On.To open when the car is locked just keep pressing thge open botton.To close just keep pressing the lock botton.
I don't seem to have those settings. Do I need to have the software updated? I have a 2009.
You can go into a service and ask that you do so or find someone with vag-com cable and software on this link you instructionshttp://www.audienthusiasts.com/VagComWindow.html
Is it possible to built in any vehicle or 4 wheeler or we can do in some specific vehicles only in which specific parts required for it is already there?
??? What's the question?
joshuatim11strikes again! Noboby understands what the heck he is on about in any of these threads!
Don't think there's an option in the menu on the Mk2 Q5 to close the windows when the locks are activated. The only method I'm aware of is the long press of the key fob locking button.
"Yes, agreed! Becoming an industry standard."
"Thanks for the feedback guys. Yep - if the window is open when you are out of the car and you are locking it, just keep pressing the lock button on the keyfob till the window is fully closed. Even if you don’t see the window open till after you have locked the car and walked away, it will still close with a long press on the keyfob. I would rather the windows close when the car was locked, but I suppose there is some reason for being set up like it is."
If you leave a dog in the car you might want to lock it and leave windows open a bit
"Hi zebbydog - good point but I would have preferred an option in the cars menus where you could have auto window raise active or not. If you are closing the windows with the long press on the keyfob, the window stops closing if you stop pressing the fob. Never mind, that’s something else I’ve found out about the car lol. Cheers"
"On my MK1 SQ5 there are 2 ways to close windows and sunroof.1. Hold lock on the keyfob.2. If you have keyless, keep your finger on the door handle.I think both work in reverse to open all windows (not sure about sunroof). Will test later."
Many thanks. Very informative post. Sorry to hear about your gearbox.
"In the six days you had the new car you would not have been able to do a realistic fuel consumption check. I have done just over 11,000 miles and have averaged a shade over 48mpg (calculated), which is nearly 30% better than my previous Q5's.BTW you can't miss when you are getting low on fuel. The gauge does go red and you get a warning flash up with 60 miles range remaining."
"Indeed, which is why I didn't quote any economy figures. Good to hear though that your Mk2 is better than MK1 and thanks for confirming re the fuel gauge."
Good write up.Thanks.
If the Audi wash is doing the job well - why change or look for another make.
"Mine do.My current screen wash is a green colour, where Audi's is a blue.It's a VAG brand called Quantum."
"Isn't Quantum blue? I generally use Prestone (green), but not sure what I bought last time. I used to like the VW official screen wash. Its quite strong and cuts through most everything with a strong lemon smell."
"Autoglym Ultimate Screen Wash wins for me, good on performance not so on price.presently on good deal at Halfrauds!- coloured pink if anyone is interested."
"Hi Raphster,Correct.Halfords GreenAudi BlueFound a bargain on Ebay X4 Audi 5 litre bottles of screen wash for £40.Rappy"
Prestone is available at Costco in 5L container -------- much cheapness
Autoglym stuff for me. I wait until Halfords have a deal on then buy in bulk (well about 5-10 bottles at a time)!

Autoglym for me too. As said wait until Halfords have 3 for 2. Also check Halfords online as it’s often cheaper and they will price match there website
So my £2 for 5L Carplan ready mixed screenwash doesn't make the list ????Ahh well needs must at the time and I'm going to be honest - it's been fine ☺

"I see the new 2.0tfsi has gone away from 8 speed auto back to s-tronic.

My sq5 has the 8 speed auto which is all round great.I was thinking that next time I might downsize and go with the 2.0tfsi, but am disappointed to see it's now stronic.I was wondering whether it is a new gereration stronic in the new q5. Also any real world comments of what it's like for round town.Thanks mark."
Hi Moss2000 I do a lot of town driving and find it really smooth. I tend to keep it out of dynamic mode while in town as lift off can be a bit quick in busy streets ( my heavy foot I guess ). Overall I’m happy with the smoothness of the changes and to be honest I don’t feel any of them unless I kick down to overtake and feel the push in the back. Very happy with it.
Thanks - I think I’ll arrange a test drive ????
The Q5 2.0TDI & TFSI always have had the 7 speed S tronic gearbox. The SQ5 and the new 3.0TDI have the 8 speed tiptronic gearbox.
"Not quite right. The facelift 2.0tfsi from 2013 got the 8 speed auto. Before 2013, they did indeed have the stronic. From 2013 the 2.0tsfi and sq5 had the 8 speed slush box."
"Confirmed, I had the 2013 petrol in Sydney and it had the 8 speed box. My 2014 diesel in the UK has the 7 speed box."

"Hi Noel74. It takes around 16 to 20 days depending on sea and weather conditions to reach Emden. Previous deliveries were via Jacksonville in Florida and Davisville in Rhode Island. Did you get an update saying the ship had left Veracruz ? Once my car had left Veracruz, the next update told me it was on a ship to the UK. Some cars can be in Emden for a matter of days before shipping to the UK. Others can be waiting for weeks waiting on a ship. It surely cannot be long now before you get the update telling you it’s on a ship for the UK. Others didn’t get any updates and got a call from the dealers telling them the car had arrived. Best of luck - hope you get your car soon."
Mine says left San Jose beginning of Jan and so far no change
"Yep- it seems it’s still a bit of a lottery as to when you get your car. It also seems their tracking info hasn’t improved since last year. I actually tracked my ship from Veracruz and knew when it arrived in Emden. After hearing nothing for around six weeks, when I asked the dealer to try and track my car, he told me it must still be at sea as it hasn’t arrived in Emden yet!! A few days later I got an update telling me it was on a ship to the UK. So you see that things can get pretty mixed up with the Audi tracker."

Just checked myaudi and it says car is in panel shop.12th Feb was my build date but looks like it has started earlier.How long does it take from panel shop to finished car?
Audi Tracker has now updated to say the car is on its way to the UK. I don't know if this is because it is Germany or if it physically loaded onto a boat.Potentially going from a late March delivery to telling the dealer to hold onto until the new registration number.

You should get an update when the car leaves the port of Veracruz. You can then track the ship using one of the ship tracking apps out there. And yes- your car will visit all those other ports before arriving in the UK
I can't remember but isn't this status when it's left Germany?
Mine has now moved to 39 (on way to UK)Yesterday it said 38 which I believe is arrived at EmdenMy audi also states on way to UK which matches 39 using the GUI version as suggested above

In theory within a week car the car is built and in Quality Control...Usually you find the car is allocated the build week which from memory is the Sunday or Monday date but usually the tracker begins to update a couple of days before and you'll find that the car is actually entering quality control on the date they'd given you for Build to start

My dealer said he wouldn't know what port of where the car is. Said my tracker is better than his! LolNot very helpful...
This seems very odd from your dealer.Mine has been happy to show me there official tracker and from day one it has shown my car coming into Grimsby.It shows the vessels being used and the ones it will be booked on in the future.The Dealer tracker is the most unto date and informative system.
My Q5 landed at Grimsby on Saturday 24th.Status stayed on 39 which is on a ship heading for UK.Status changed this morning to 40 and arrived in UK so its a couple of days behind.Screen shots from dealer shows that transport to dealer was arranged yesterday on Monday 26th.It will be interesting to see how long the Port to Dealer shuffle takes.
Spoke with my dealer today as it has now been 9 days since landing in the UK and 7 days since there transfer request was put in.I am scheduled to be loaded and delivered tomorrow arriving at the dealership at 15:00.Requested to go in tomorrow and sort paperwork and organise pick up day.Happy days.

Got a call from my dealer saying my car arrived in Emden last Friday. Hopefully will be on a ship to the UK. Not sure which port it will be going into.
Emden ETA for CIEM CISERO now Friday 4th April @ 18:00 (UTC+2).Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk Pro
"So dealer is near Reading, so I'm guessing Sheerness. Although he did say it would be another 3 weeks till the car comes. Not sure how long it sits at the port in U.K."
@Mjr2004 your timeline is interesting. My QC to left factory gap was only 7 days. Hoping my shipping times match yours!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Well they didn't do much QC with mine but it was there for ages. I think by now they will have sped up the QC time. Once it leaves the factory I think the times should be fairly accurate.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

It appears that they do some checking at Emden. Easter will definitely have slowed things a bit.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Just checked my Audi and it says on a ship to the UK! Hopefully not long now.

"Nice, if things go quickly you could have your car within a week to 10 days.Which is the nearest port to your dealer?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
Sheerness would be the nearest to the dealer. A ship arrived from Emden early evening yesterday. Checked my tracker and it still says on a ship to the uk. Might take a little while to update.
Easter may slow things down a bit. Still a great result so far given that you were a Week 7 build.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
I would think if not next weekend the weekend after it should be at he dealer. Seems the logistics have improved with the Q5 now.Where's you car right now? Have you tracked the ship down to Emden?

Exciting times! Are you swapping a previous car for the Q5?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
No not swapping. I sold my BMW 3 series back in Jan. Was on PCP. Got a good price for it from a local independent dealer. Got enough equity back for the deposit on the Q5.Family getting bigger = more practical car.Received the registration for the car yesterday as well.
Just to update. Car still not at dealers since landing in U.K. On 31 March. Still hopeful it will be there in the next few days so I can pick up on at the weekend.
Up to a couple of weeks seems a normal lead time. Dealer saying anything?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Dealer said last we he was hopeful it would be with him within 10 days. 10days is tomorrow. Today just said it isn't here yet. You would think they know when the cars are due to arrive off a transporter.
"mxnrg said:You're fortunate to have got a ride in a car with air. I found the car on standard springs in comfort to be a bit too hard so good to hear your opinion on air. I did 50/50 between dynamic and comfort on my drive, didn't give it to full beans but was very impressed.Dealers and Audi UK say they can only track the cars from when they are checked-in in Emden. They did say they can name the ship from Emden to the UK. Good plan to ignore it for now, as I'm 4 weeks since leaving the factory I'm getting more keen!4-5 times per video on YouTube for me!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk ProClick to expand...I take it from this that you've added air suspension to yours? I know some are not bothered for this, but to it makes it a hugely adaptive car - serenely smooth cruiser in Comfort mode and great fun in Dynamic mode. It doesn't have the driving dynamics of the Macan but this to me was a one trick pony - it excelled at it, Granted, but it needs to be driven fast. The SQ5 with air means you can have the best of both worlds. I think you will be genuinely very pleased with it."

Car still not arrived at dealer after arriving in Sheerness 2 weeks ago. Saying it should be here sometime next week. There's a backlog on delivery in the U.K. now apparently!

I've got the reg details. Got that over a week ago. Just logistical issues at the moment.
"mxnrg said:So my month of analysis has yielded the below. My car left the factory in Mexico on March 12th and arrived in Germany on April 12th.

Good news. Car arrived at the dealer today. Will be collecting at the weekend!Finally the wait is over!!It seems the turnaround is quite quick from emden to U.K. But a lottery once on our shores to get to the dealer.

What I did notice was there isn't many shops to Sheerness as say to Grimsby. Myaudi didn't update for me even though the car was on its way to Sheerness. Every chance it's on it's way.

All new Audi deliveries are now halted due to a technical issue with the phone box option. They need to do a technical fix and won't hand cars over.Was due to collect on Sunday. I'm awaiting the next steps.
"Possibly explains why my dealer has not called me back this week...Real bummer for you, any estimates for the fix?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
Back on for collecting tomorrow. Apparently there's a licensing issue with the amplifier that connects your phone to the cars Ariel. The fix is that they are removing them from the cars until further notice.

Great news. Don't forget the pics tomorrow ????
"So despite my be effort to try just forget about my car, which left the factory on 28 March, I have been messing on the Marine Traffic website and can see that 3 ships are currently in transit between Mexico and Emden. I have set up a Fleet and now get email updates on their progress. Sad, I know. Plus have now idea whether my car is on any of them, so just keeping fingers crossed."
"You are as sad as me, probably quite sad ???? I was the same as you with the transatlantic RoRo's before my car got to Emden. I now track all ships from Emden to Sheerness, there have been 4 in the 9 days since my car got to Germany and not a sniff of my car being on any of them. Not knowing why it's been sitting in Emden 9 days is annoying me...Status 38 is good, 39 would be better!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
I use Findship pro which gives you the ships details and destinations if you click on the ships icon. I thought Marine Traffic did the same. My car was in Veracruz for around 3 weeks before being shipped. Haven’t you had an update from Audi telling you the car is on its way and has left Veracruz ?
"I called my dealer to see if they can get any more info at all on this. Someone is looking into it for me. I was expecting July delivery, so any of these vessels are well ahead of expectation. But, my current car will need new tyres if it is still to be July, whereas I might be able to get it back to VW without replacing them if its sooner. I expected the cost of the new tyres so it would be a bonus if I can afford it.@Avicov - where are the pics ?!?"
Hi all. Sorry been busy driving the new car! It's been great so far.Silly question but how do I post a picture here? Can't seem an option to do it!

Very nice. Are you pleased with it ? I was toying with this colour but in the end went for Navarro Blue as it reminded my of my very first Audi. I do like the look of your colour.
Yes very happy. So smooth to drive and very refined. It's my first Audi so had to go with Daytona. I saw a Navarro on Sunday when I picked mine up and it looked very nice in the sun.

"Hi Steve, I got caught into the trap of tracking every ship from Mexico to Emden !! Had to give it a break this week whilst I wait for it to be shipped to the UK.You may be aware, but status will not change from '30' until your car arrives in Emden, so there is little way of knowing which ship your car is on. Some seem to have been able to find out from their dealer, but most seem to say there's no way of knowing. So your car could be anywhere between the factory and Emden !!"
"Hey Rus,Thanks for the info.So really, I'm waiting for a '36'? I may try to find out from the dealer, but I'm sure once I have a definite ship name, I'll be tracking it 24/7! Trying to be adult, and patient, about this, but you know...Any news yours? Hopefully not still stuck in Emden?"
"Steve. I am still in Emden. I was though really lucky leaving Veracruz so have to look at it the round.Mine did go to status 36, but this is rare.

My SA is calling me on Tuesday. They haven't given any indication yet how long it might be from here.I wonder if the Audi Phone Box issue worked in my favour. I haven't specced it and if cars with it are being held in Emden then I might have jumped up the queue.
I reckon you are onto something regarding not having Audi Phone Box and your car getting shipped to the UK without abnormal delay.

I ordered in mid-December with a 5.5 month estimate.

So that is 2 months after build...Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Awesome you're so close! I guess a week tops?Apparently ours is at 'check point 8'?!? And they're say upto 6 weeks to arrive in Germany ????. Here's hoping the trade winds work in my favour!!Our build date was 23rd April so I guess they're coming through a bit quicker these days. Could be the WLTP rush!
Fantastic and that's a nice surprise for you. Perfect timing for the return of your old car.

So I thought the whole point of having the factory in Mexico was was quick delivery to USA? Thought they would just be rolling them across the border by the truck load as soon as they come out of the factory. But they still go on ships to the USA? So it must be mostly for the really cheap labour.
I think the cars headed to the west coast end up in trains from San Jose Chiapa. However the ones headed East are on the boats out of Veracruz. It was always about the cheap labour...Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Car at the dealers and picking up on Monday afternoon. Happy days. I will do a full run down of my build and delivery schedule when I am at my laptop.
Mine was finally delivered on the 18th May so hopefully I'll collect mine in the next week or so!

"Yeah I spoke to Audi UK today also, they pretty much said its still in Emden waiting and there is nothing else they can tell me. They told me to contact the Audi centre I ordered it from to see if there is anything they can do. I guess she meant in terms of a loan car until mine arrives etc."
Looks like ours got on a boat last night and is on its way now ????
If Emden is full to capacity- why don’t Audi get their act together and acquire extra shiping. Just another load of bullshit from Audi

Hilooking at getting a new pressure washer - deals on Karcher K2 & K4 out there but is the K4 worth the extra?Probably get a snow foam lance and do both cars on a Saturday - will the K2 handle that with some patio cleaning in between?If anyone has these models I would appreciatte feedback - thanks!!
I've got a K4 and PA snow foam lance from Polished Bliss. Both aren't cheap but do a great job...
"What is the hose length, aim for a hose of 10 metres so you don't have to move the washer or risk it tipping over by overstretching.Nilfisk also get great reviews and are reported to be built with better components."
"For patio cleaning with a Karcher get a Dirtblaster lance, wickedly effective though ultimately buggers the top surface of the slabs...especially cheap ones...."
Thanks - looks like they come with 4m/6m hose max - both deals I have seen come with the dirtblaster lance.Still comparing the deals that are arround out there but will need to get it before the Q5 arrives - latest date was the 12th....................
Nilfisk all the way better than the rest out there on the Market for price. We only have to change out lance o rings as we disconnect it all the time great machine.
"4m hose would be useless on a car the size of the Q5 unless you want to keep moving the machine which is a pain. 6m still too short in my opinion but depends on where you are setting the machine. Mine has 10m hose whch when fully extended lets me work right round the car without pulling hard on it. Also look carefully at the materials in the hose, the Karchers tend to come with a plastic type hose which can split very easily, I went through a few of these before replacing with a proper rubber hose which is loads better.The Patio cleaners are the job for slabs, keeps a lot of the spray better contained."
I have a K2 with the snowfoam lance and a 6m extention hose giving 10m in all.I have the dirtbuster lance as well likethisone
Thanks guys - hose extension/Nilfisk research added to list of things to research while awaiting the Q5..............
Also in the market for a pressure washer (sorry for the hijack by the way) as I need to give the patio a blast.What wattage would you guys recommend?This seems like a good deal with all of the accessories included. 1650w sufficient you reckon or should I go for the new 2100w version which is double the price?http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/7420449.htm

No issues with using a power washer on new (or even old) paintwork?
Providing you don't use the washer in one spot for too long or on peeling paint you'll be fine.

I suspect that this may have been down to the Autoglym paint protection."
"I got a Nilfisk a year or so ago due to all the positive comments. The pressure is nothing to write home about (maybe I got a cheap model) and the patio tool broke on the first use after about five minutes....

"The old Karchers are made of better stuff than the new ones. Mine is easily 10 years old, going well, was £400 when I bought it so it was not a budget machine.If you buy a new pressure washer for £100 you really can't expect a lot in terms of performance or longevity."
Getting a loan of a Karcher this week-end not sure what model it is but hopefully help me decide which way to go....
"You can buy longer hoses for the Karcher washers, I have a 9m on mine. Park the pressure washer at the front of the car and easily gets round without pulling on it.MT"
Hilooking at getting a new pressure washer - deals on Karcher K2 & K4 out there but is the K4 worth the extra?Probably get a snow foam lance and do both cars on a Saturday - will the K2 handle that with some patio cleaning in between?If anyone has these models I would appreciatte feedback - thanks!!
I think lidl are doing a deal on a jet washer at the moment - not sure about the quality. May be worth a look? This link may also be of interest.http://www.karcheroutlet.co.uk/
Nilfisk P150 is my weapon of choice .Comes with 10m Armored Hose.Never buy Karcher again had 2 one was free replacement.
"Cleanstore.co.ukalways have some pretty decent deals on Pressure Washers, worth a look."
"I need to replace my Karcher as water started leaking out from underneath at the week end. I always keep it in the house over winter as my previous washer was buggered by the frost one year, so its not that. Disappointing as its not that old."
Spotted the Lidl's one this morning - £89.99 I believe. I didn't have a close look as I was in a hurry.

I think that was March last year.
Ordered a Karcher K5 from Costco - Home & Car package with foam lance etc - as I wasn't impressed with the K2 and the hose was too short.Thanks for the comments and sorry for not being about much - enjoying the car too much plus busy at work with the financial year end...............
Agreed. I have seen cheaper karcher models die especially during prolonged use like cleaning patios so I opted for a model up from what I required but it is a fair age now and not missed a beat but again it want cheap. I a big believer in you get what you pay for.
Bloody predictive texting makes it look like I skipped school for a few years!
Next problem is which snow foam to get? Halfords only have Demon Wash from Car Plan - might be my quick fix...
This Snow Foam had good reviewshttp://www.theultimatefinish.co.uk/snow-foam/ultimate-snow-foam-5-litres.aspx
Thanks - will try the Halfords one out first (just because I can get it quick) plus I think the K5 package has a car wash bottle with it so between the two should make a good job.
i have a K4 only niggle is hose is too short always shifting the pressure washer while doing the cars i have the karcher foam lance seems to work fine but i haven't tried any others so cant comparealso wish they did a anti twist hose too
K5 comes with 8m hose - hopefully will be long enough - will let you know how it goes after the week-end.
"THe plastic hose that modern Karchers come with is rubbish, kinks and wears too easily. Change it for a rubber type hose from Ebay, they are much easier to use, don't kink and you could buy a longer length."
"Resurrecting an old thread. My baby Karcher 2.35 after years of good service has finally gone up in smoke (literally).So I'm after a cheap replacement, that I can use with all my Karcher accessories and PA Snow foam Lance.I like the look of the K4, but I don't like the price! Also looking at K2 and Nilfisk equivalents (C110 etc), but I would need an adapter to use my existing accessories and snow foam lance.Suggestions for a good bang for buck?"
"If the adaptor's not too expensive I'd go Nilfisk, mine is quite a few years old now and it's still going strong. I had Karchers before but they didn't last me and were noisier.Amazon quite often have deals, I needed a new hose and lance but instead ended up buying a c120 for £60 delivered. The tools fit the bigger unit and the compact will come in handy for cleaning the moss off the house roof."
That's a good price for a C120! Amazon had a C110 for £59 the other day but I didn't bite.

"Today some bugger dented my drivers door in Tesco, quite badly..........grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr and I park out of the way.Called out Dentmaster to get the dent out, and when he saw what car it was he sucked in hard (as normal), and said ""did you know the side windows are double glazed on these Q5s"", so I had a look and they do consist of two layers of glass with membrane in between.Trouble is they cannot ""lean"" against the glass to get the dent out of the door as they normally do, due to how thin each piece of glass is, (2 pieces of glass plus the membrane is obviously as thick as a normal window so is only 40% the thickness of a normal window).So he spent 2 hours sucking the dent out with adhesive suckers, dent is gone now but £100 lighter in the pocket.."
I thought it was just the v6 version that had double glazing? At least on the mk1 that’s what I was lead to believe.

I read a report yesterday suggesting that the new Continental winter contact TS850 might be suitable for all year UK use.I think tyre manufacturers should put some effort into providing an all year solution for the UK. They seem to be able to sort things for other larger markets leaving us to compromise time and time again.
Just a thought. Stopping quickly is obviously good. But if the vehicle behind you has summer tyres on then there is a greater risk of a rear collision.
But then you are not to blame for road accidents. Guilt borne by the driver who hit your vehicle rear
Would it be this one.http://wheelworldreviews.co.uk/features/winter-tyres-could-you-use-them-all-year-round/
Well Quattro and Snow and Ive tyres have performed brilliantly this morning. As sure footed as a mountain goat!
"I had a huge argument with Spinjun last year, told him to go back to his motherland of Beirut, shame he didn't heed my advice!"
"Kramer said:I've been driving the A8 quattro (on summers) all weekend and got home last night at 1am with no problems at all. I had to go down side roads which had deep snow and ice and the car handled it without even seeing the ESP light. Personally I think that winter tyres are great HOWEVER they are a huge pain to fit every year and store plus a significant cost. Winters are useless with less than 4mm tread so you may not get a huge about of life out of them. All together this is a pain which is not really worthwhile for the 1 week of snow we usually get in most of the UK IMO unless you do a load of driving and really need your car working (i.e for work or if you have a baby on the way or something).If you are an experienced driver with quattro you can drive safely on summers. Some of the 2 wheel drive German cars need winter tyres just to move in the snow (like my A5 did) so this would be a must. Last night the side roads were peppered with BMW and Mercs who obviously had given up and ditched the car.If the weather continues like this I think we will see more ""all season"" tyres being offered. I would consider all season next time on my car but there is no way I am shelling out for separate winters. I am very impressed with the Audi Quattro and I felt safe most of the time (breaking is a little more delicate). As long as you are sensible and keep well below the speed limit with lots of room ahead of you the car will be fine.Click to expand...Totally agree with you Kramer. The reason I switched to the Q5 was due to getting stuck in the snow 2-3 years ago and 2 years ago having an accident costing me my NCB and nearly a £1k hike in insurance premiums (also live in a high theft risk area). I'm lucky in that I have a mate with a garage who can store and fit my tyres. As you say its probably the Quattro that does most the work but for me I'd rather be safe than sorry...Hows the A8 treating you?"
"I managed to get the ESP light to come on a few times down an untreated road this weekend. I am of the opinion that you need to ""explore"" what your car can do in a controlled environment so you get to know it better to help you handle those tricky moments.It's the first time I have driven a 4wd in the snow and ice and I was impressed with the difference."
"Exactly Ransman, was so tempted to find an empty car park this morning but had to get to work!"
I did the ESP off test in a car park at the weekend and it was interesting so i used the other half of the carpark with ESP on and the difference was very obvious when braking!car and nut driver were both safe as i waited til it was empty to do it and made sure i stayed clear of kerbs!ESP off is better for snow and ice
"I understand Land Rover offer ""free"" off- road courses if you are interested in one of their vehicles. If Audi offered the same I would take them up on it (as long as it wasn't my car)."
"I've done the LR stage 1 and 2 course. I got the first one free and i paid for the second. Anyone can pay and do there courses. The techniques they will teach you can be applied to any vehicle as most of the latest LR/RR's don't have the extra diff locks fitted as they are a cost option that most people won't pay for lol.So i think it is worth going and doing a 2 day course. There are a few places around the UK to choose from, but the best is definitely Eastnor Castle."

"Frankly speaking, incase of such accident, I'd prefer to have rear of the car destroyed than front. Unless it is totalled, it gives you chance to keep untouched engine, front suspension and steering. It is definitely easer to properly repair rear part."
"I have Goodyear Wranglers fitted to an old 4x4 which are marked, ""all weather"" and perform well in the snow. Probably not a great road tyre for the Q5 but I am surprised there are not more all weather tyres available - perhaps compromise is too significant?"
My compromise of all season tyres is definitely better than being on summer rubber.I just dropped my car off at the dealer to change the tow bar and fix the latest fault. Got a lift back in an A6 which was extremely twitchy on the route I had just driven down with no problem. We were harassed by a clown in an X3 who thinks he is invincible!
"jamiekip said:Winter tyres give you options in this scenario. Lets face it, non of us jump to an emergency stop without immediately looking in your rear view mirror to see what's next in line. With winters you could slow and take evasive action to get out of the way. Summers you're a passanger with no option but to ride out the slide and pray. I've had to do this in bad conditions and I drove away with no damange to my car, whlist the car behind has had an accident.As for getting the life out of winter tyres. I run them on my TTRS from November to March/April and I'm on my 3rd season with a set of Michelin Pilot Alpin PA3's. They have 7mm of life on them still all round and when the snow isn't here I drive the car like I normally would, and when temps exceed there operating window, the car is great fun, allowing power slides out of corners at sensible speeds. I'd expected them to die quickly, but they'ree lasting incredibly well.I'm an ambassador for winter tyres now, will recommend them to anyone in a heart beat, and although the cost is initially hard to stomach, they pay for themselves over time as your summer tyres have a longer life tenure, my summers will need changing for the first time in April.I'm still debating whether to get a Q5, but my worry with these cars on snow/ice is tha yes quattro will get you going, but trying to haul speed off 2 tonnes quickly will not be easy on summer tyres.It's a preference thing though, but I guess my point is, there isn't an excuse not to use them, as costs even out over time and most garages will store your winters/summers for you.Click to expand...Hi Jamie,Good to see you on here. What winters did you have on the TT RS? I considered it a few times but never got around to it, however I will probably go this route with the SQ5..Cheers,Mark........Ahh I see now, Alpins."

I'd subscribe to the theory that they have masses of excess production capacity except that there is still a 2-3 month lead time for allocation of factory build slots. I'd guess this is due to the fact that any order placed now will be a MY2019 car by definition due to the ordering backlog...Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
Isn't switch over around Wk 22?
"Well they are obviously selling now - having only seen a few in the 7 months I have had mine I saw 2 18 plates on the M25 today (between j12 and 20, 2pm to 3pm), a grey one on 20s and a black (looking) one on 21s I think..."
"Spoke to my dealer today re the SQ5 (keen to get me in one for a test drive - though I suspect it won't be anywhere near as much fun as the RSQ3) and asked why the configurator was reporting such and neither he, nor the dealer knew.

"I would love a diesel SQ5 as I love the low down torque of the diesel, personally I would never consider a petrol version."
"I have driven diesels most of my life it seems - including 5 and 6 cylinder from BMW, Audi, Merc, Volvo and Alfa. Can't say I miss any of them when I am driving my petrol SQ5. Low down torque or extended rev range and a silky smooth aural delight..."
How do you cope with the fuel costs?
"Having had two diesel SQ5s and now a bonkers quick RSQ3 for a couple of years (2.5 5cyl petrol - 340PS), which is, I believe a little more thirsty than the current SQ5 there isn't actually a great deal of difference because petrol is cheaper. My SQs averaged (real world, calculated at the pumps, not read off the DIS 38-39 MPG), the RS on the same roads will do 31 MPG. Factor in that petrol is cheaper plus none of that Adblue crap and it's very close."
"I reckon it costs me about a tenner a week more in fuel than previous car - 28mpg versus 37mpg, 11 to 12k a year. In the scheme of the depreciation that's nothing. The range is probably more of a ball ache as 400 miles per tank is about it....compared to 600 plus on the bigger tank in the previous car - and I hate stopping for fuel mid journey!"
"It's a different type of car - better tech, better refinement but not as hard core. Probably not as much fun. But pretty good all the same if you are in the mood (or late!)"

"I wouldn't mind the Lambo - saw one being delivered to a dealers the other day, left hand drive. That would rule it out (along with price and running costs!)"
"andy947 said:Its limited availability for a number of reasons.First, they are introducing a diesel one. Its not confirmed whether there will still be a petrol option or not.Second, they are trying to catch up with production, to meet customer expectations they will be prioritising customer orders over stock/showroom cars.Its is not possible to order any SQ5 at the moment, and even spec amending existing ones is near impossible.i was close to pulling the trigger on a spec amendable one last week, went away for the weekend, then they shut it all down, so can no longer get the car i want.......Click to expand...And you know this how?

"I have been lurking for a few months whilst looking for a new car and pulled the trigger on a new SQ5 last month (currently in transit from the factory).

I have also not taken my 2.0 tdi Q5 on a 63 plate to be remapped or what ever they do to them. I no longer trust Audi.The out come of this is I also do not let them service it as I can't trust them not to do the update. It's a sad state when a maker of great cars can on longer be trusted.
"After my dealership changed the master brake cylinder as part of trying to fix the brake pedal noise, I noticed that the mpg I was achieving on a regular journey I take had dropped from 38 to 34 mpg in my petrol Q5. Another update ? Has shown 38 in eco mode since I got the car last May."
Apparently Audi had till the 2nd of February to come up with a fix. I have heard nothing.
Thanks but I will stick with my petrol car. The fuel cost difference is insignificant for the mileage I do and the sound of the petrol V6 is worth it....
"Just as a data point, depending on your driving style, driving distance, and fuel costs, the savings could be substantial. I usedFuelly.comto determine real-world fuel economy for the 2.0L petrol (gasoline) Q5, and used the most optimistic numbers, and compared that to my actual fuel economy. My calculations show I save about 36.3% 39.7% in fuel cost per mile, which translates into a savings of about CAD$765 to $886 per year. That's due to a combination of much better fuel economy, and lower pump prices for fuel."
"Not the same in the UK -petrol is slightly cheaper than diesel. But I have calculated that I would save about £10 a week by having diesel - after about 25 years of diesel cars with only sporadic petrol motors, I am happy to spend the £10 a week extra for the aural pleasure and smoothness of the petrol."
How much is a litre of diesel and petrol over in Canada ? Prices vary around the UK but in my area diesel is around £1.19 (2.08 CD) a litre and petrol around £1.18 a litre (2.06 CD)

The sat nav controls are from a pre facelift car. The front is obviously facelift. Run a mile lol ????
You should phone them up and tell them the car was written off and tell them it’s a mix of parts. Or you could go for a test drive and see what happens when you try the paddles lol. Maybe the radio will change stations or the windscreen washers will spray lol. Or maybe a call to trading standards is required.

"CountJunkula said:Hi guys,I'm putting this up here partly because I'm curious as to what you guys think but also as a flag to any potential buyers.This car came up for sale around a month ago. It looked like a bargain and was priced £1000 cheaper than it is now.It's a 2012 2.0 TDI S-Line with only 50k on the clock. LG12CMZWhen I first called the dealer I was told it was a stolen recovered and had come ""straight from the insurance"". There was only one photo on the listing. The fact that it had ""never been damaged"" was appealing and I was ready to buy it.I then noticed that the picture on the listing was the same picture as I'd seen in another advert so I called again to check. The guy told me that the picture I had seen was not the actual car but it looked the same...He gave me the Reg plate of the actual car and said pics would follow.I checked the Reg and it came up as an early 2012 model. At the time I was only looking for a facelift car, I was looking at other (late) 2012 cars that were newer than this one and they were pre-facelift so I was confused as to how this (early) 2012 was a facelift.The dealer said he was 'pretty sure' that it was a facelift but had not actually seen the car yet. The next day he sent me an iPhone photo of the car looking dirty and parked up on a side street with the matching reg - and it was indeed a facelift.I then noticed that the steering wheel had the auto paddleshift, but the car was a manual? Alarm bells again?I made an appointment to view the car to check it out myself. On the morning of the viewing I was told they were having problems starting the car and I wouldn't be able to see it that day. The following day I was told the car was on its way to an Audi specialist to get the issue sorted.A week later I called again and was told the car problem still hadn't been resolved but should be ready in a few days.By this time I had seen another car I was interested in so didn't want to wait around for this one if it was a lemon.I did a HPI check on the car that same day and it noted that the car was written off CAT D in 2015, so it hadn't come ""straight from the insurance"" as I had been told days earlier?I checked out some of the mot history and one of them mentioned it failed an mot for wheel bolts missing in some of the wheels and had something up with the steering rack.Either way I had now lost all interest in the car and forgotten about it, but a few days ago I noticed it appear on autotrader again but this time for £14,880 and looking mint, not the £13,880 it was advertised for a few weeks back.Here is the advert, what do you guys think?https://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201803094425888Notice the paddles on the steering wheel but it's a manual? Something about the chrome trim on the front bumper doesn't look the same as other similar cars?I'm guessing it was a pre-facelift, either crashed or stolen and stripped in 2015 and repaired with facelift parts, including a facelift steering wheel from an auto car. I might be 100% wrong but something doesn't add up.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...It had done 48k miles by October 2016 so not many since then. Does it have a FSH and a MOT from October 2017? Or was it off road in repair?The dealer has some other car dealing business that have been dissolved.Your gut instinct seems to be operating well.

"I'm not sure about the service history tbh, the google reviews for the dealer aren't great either."
Facelift cars have silver buttons which are grouped in a different way.
Mine is a facelift but has the same buttons at this one. I think the silver buttons come with the MMI High option rather than the facelift/preSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Have they changed the advert? As the car is listed as a Cat D.
"No it was always listed as a Cat D, but the seller told me it was an undamaged stolen recovered and that it had just come direct from the insurance, this was 3 weeks ago.When I did a HPI it showed it was Cat D in 2015.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Cat D is only uneconomical repair, cosmetic, not structural, and the lowest category of 'write off', usually down to repair cost (main dealer labour charges at £120+vat p/hour mounts up) against value of vehicle , personally I wouldn't buy one but if it's cheap and has been repaired properly - why not?"
"Fair doos, not disagreeing Countjunkula, but he's a second hand car dealer, bullsxxt........................it's in their DNA. At least he wasn't hiding the catD."
There's enough other ones out there for sale... I'd run a mile from this one!! Everything is indeed a bit fishy with it.
About a month ago I purchased an approved Audi Q5. I understand they serviced it as part of the deal. Is there a way I can check that as Audi do not have services books. Thanks.
What does the instrument service indicator say.
"Register your car on MyAudi (mobile app available too) and you can see both the main services and additional work. It does make suggestions too i.e. sunroof service, but somehow misses that the current car Audi needs spark plugs every 20,000 miles (£200 a set plus labour and only available from Audi - yikes!)."
Where did you see that?
"Hi Missile, long time no speak!Yeah, the 5 pot 340PS RSQ3 needs plugs every 20,000 miles - it is, without doubt the best Audi I've ever owned by some distance but now nearing the end of it's warranty - so the extend warranty or replace conundrum, pondering a Q5 again..."
"This is the first 4x4 I've ever had and I love it for the most part.It feels noticeably quicker than our 3.0TDi A6 and it's great to drive on the motorway.But I can't help feel a bit sick when I'm driving it around town - especially somewhere unfamiliar when you're checking your mirrors every two seconds.I *think* it's down to this. The fact that it's a shorter car than the A6, means you need to really swivel your head to look in the mirrors, but it could be that it's more wallowy than the A6 and I haven't got used to it yet.Anyone else get this?NB - my daughter's also said she feels a bit more sick in it."
"Hi Kell - I felt exactly the same the first time I drove my S-Line. I started to feel a bit sickly and my head was slightly dizzy. It passed after a week, and I put it down to mixture of nerves and excitement brought on by driving a brand new car and my first SUV. The way the car has a slight hesitation when taking off then gets up to speed can make a weak stomach react. My wife commented on how it feels like being pushed when on a swing when she was younger ( I don’t do swings now lol ). Hopefully these feelings will pass for you and the family. Maybe the car is rolling slightly more in bends than what you have been used to as well. Stick with it and enjoy your car."
Your an Audi drive so therefor exempt from checking the mirrors.
I thought that was bmw drivers í ½í¸
You’re also sitting in a more upright position than in a saloon car. Make sure the air intake is not set to interior recirculating too and check the rear seat area heating (3 zone heating system) is not set too high in the back.
RS4 or you will kick yourself.
So you are going petrol next time? Can't say I blame you - although an extra 15k plus for RS strikes me as hard to justify now it is only a V6 the same...
"Having had the RS6 I looked closely when the latest RS4 arrived at my dealers as was interested in one.But for some reason after having had a test drive of the car, it was a little underwhelming.I no longer ""need the speed"", but I want engine noise and kerb appeal, the new RS4 sounded flat and I need it to look a little meaner.Nothing like a V8 (or V10) pulling away with sports exhaust."
New tyres needed and am being quoted £894 fitted for 4 x Pirelli P Zero 255 / 40 / 21 inclusive of wheel balancing and old tyre disposal.Seems pretty reasonable??

"Car is showing 26k miles @ 2 years old last month but, that includes 4k miles done on a separate set of winter wheels and tyres, ie. about 22k miles completed on the original Pirelli P Zero's with 3mm left on the fronts and 5mm on the rears.We've just rotated these front to back today to squeeze another 1500 miles or so, and will look to fit these new ones (just ordered) towards the end of May."

"Hi. Just looking at car in Scotland and asked them to send me the spec sheet and it has the suspension description as ""suspension range 248"". Any idea what that is? I think I attached the document. Doing via iPad so little difficultThanks"
This is the attachment
"Don't know what the numbers actually mean but AFAIK the Mk1 SQ5 didn't have any suspension options like air, adaptive or mag. It's very much 'take it or leave it', ie slightly lower/firmer springs than a standard Q5, probably different shocks as well.IMO it's a nice setup and sits well on the 21s.Quick squint at this post makes me think it's probably something to do with upgrading the wheels from 20s to 21s?http://www.audi-sport.net/xf/threads/new-member-sq5-ordered.235956/"

"Yesterday, I drove my Mk2 Q5 500 miles down through France, with 4 hours at night on the motorway, during which time I was quite often 'flashed' by oncoming traffic indicating that my dipped LED headlights were dazzling them. As far as I'm aware, the UK specced LED headlights do not have any method of adjusting them for right hand driving, plus they have automatic range adjustment for differing vehicle loadings to prevent dazzling, so I'm puzzled??!!I understand that LED lights are supposed to be brighter than Xenons and halogens, but as this is the first car I've had with LEDs, I was wondering if anyone has experienced similar with their LED headlights whilst driving in the UK or abroad?"
We drove to Italy in my mates A6 with LED headlamps - it defo has a setting to change them to driving on the right.... Check in the CAR part of the menu?
"I have the same car, the LED standard lights are not handed...............as told to me by 2 Audi reps.Also get flashed all the time in the UK, must say I prefer the Xenons in my Caravelle which give a Larger, Wider beam."
"Thanks for this info, and I tend to agree that I preferred the Xenons on my previous A3 saloon, but this didn't have the LED dynamic rear indicators, which I really like on my Q5!"
Beam pattern on LEDs is not specific to hand of drive like Xenons.Agree LEDs are bloody bright!. Mrs Rappys Mini has them & they are super bright compared to my Xenons.Rappy
"Can't say that I'm all that impressed with the LED lights on my Q5. I find that the high frequency light tends to make road signs, traffic cones or anything else fluorescent glow incredibly brightly but the light seems to get absorbed and not reflected by other objects, e.g.cyclists! They are incredibly bight to look at but a disappointment in lighting the way! I also get flashed but that's often because in twilight you can hardly tell the difference between dipped and full beam and the little blue indicator is easily missed."
"This is exactly what I experienced during my journey, and found the depth of light on full beam lacking when compared to my previous Xenons......trouble is, there's not much we can do about the LEDs!!"
"I agree with AllanG and geoff3, especially in the wet, on dip beam the light seems to disappear. Driving down the M5 in heavy rain and spray in traffic on Thursday before Easter I was wondering if the lights were on at all!Full beam is pretty good but can create dazzle from some of the bigger road signs."
Do the issues people have described apply to Matrix LED or the 'standard' LED headlights?Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk Pro
I'm guessing LEDs. Not matrix LEDS. Heard nothing but great reviews about matrix. My next car will have these.Rappy.
"Mine are the standard Sline LED headlights, not the Matrix ones."
My A6 with LED headlamps definitely has the adjustment setting in the car part of the menu as stated by Badbaz.I would be surprised if LED's on the Q5 were not handed if this can be adjusted on the A6.Steve
"Just checked all the settings in the Car and Vehicle sections of the MMI menu, and there is definitely not any left/right hand driving adjustment setting for the LED headlights.....more's the pity, as this option was available for the Xenons on my A3 saloon menu!Oh well, just have to keep thinking all the cars that flash me, know me...haha!!"
"EXACTLY..........Xenons were better for seeing objects, and signs did not blind me as they do with LEDs."
Im sure my Q5 has an adjustment in the car menu.21
"Can you check this for definite, please.....and can you confirm your Q5 is a Mk2 model?Many thanks!"
Only thing in the handbook........Your vehicle is equipped with an automatic head light range control system that reduces glare for oncoming traffic if the vehicle load changes.The headlight range adjusts automatically .
"Yep, I saw this when I was looking if there was a headlight adjustment option in the handbook. IMHO, the auto range control isn't very effective!!"
Anybody noticed a drop off in fuel consumption recently? I have done a couple of trips in the last few days and the FC is showing much poorer figures than I would have expected. I guess various anti-freezing agents are added to diesel at this time of the year but can that be the reason? I will be filling up from a different garage next time to check out that variable.
Yes. The winter additives make a significant difference to fuel consumption.

"Keep in mind this is from Loughborough University. Who knows how well they're hooked into the automotive industry, or who (if anyone) is knocking down their door to get at this new technology? A university's ""two years until production"" could be dramatically different than a car company telling you what it takes from ""proof of concept"" to ""on the road"", having passed emissions certification.Regardless, I drive a 3.0 TDI, and I love it. I'm hopeful that this technology, or something else, can make a massive reduction in diesel NOx emissions."
"Having owned many Audi's over the years and having now seen 4 different 2017 q5's the build quality looks quite good, fingers crossed that ours will be just as good."
Do cars being built in Germany get built by using different screwdrivers?
"No they don't, but my wife in September purchased her 3rd TT Roadster - on the surface her motor looked OK, but looking closely you could see were Audi had cut corners with insulation etc, faults with the roof, door seals, alloy wheel damaged, door wouldn't close properly etc hence the reference to quality."
"TT is not built in Germany.. but german cars are not the best built from a quality point of view.I'd say you can alway get an unlucky car regardless of brand. Those question will take time to be answered, but it comes down to engineering not assembly in more cases.German engineering has not kept paced with the perceived view pimped by marketing.."
"Sadly, I have to agree with you, Audi has great marketing, smart show rooms that look the part. Their track record on reliability is not brilliant - just look at the car surveys. Having said that I still love Audis, having driven nothing else for 14 years (including my missus). We always look at other brands when changing but still come back to Audi. To be fair to Audi they have always been good at dealing with warranty issues that we have had even when the car has just been out of warranty."

Hi allCould people share their experiences of using a third party Tacham approved car trackers please? Live in a neighbourhood with high rates of car burglaries and thinking of getting a tracker. Not sure if I should go for a Cat5 or Cat6 device. Any suggestions much appreciated. Thanks.

"Trackers are marmite...some people love them,, some people hate them.It made sense from an insurance perspective to have one fitted on the SQ5. Live in South London."

Guess their making that much off the pcp overall that they can afford to lose on the few of us that settle. The dealer said to me you'd be surprised at the amount of people that say they are going to settle and then never do so we take a gamble.​​Also working in the industry every day I see people given huge repair bills for damage and mileage penaties to hand back their vehicles if their not taking another car. I'm afraid I don't fancy being held to ransom or anyone telling me how many miles I can drive. Must say Audi aren't anywhere near as bad as merc when giving vehicles back though.​​Personally I think the whole pcp thing is just creating a bubble, a nation of debt, it basically allows people to drive cars that they cant really afford, everyday I see people distraught and even in tears because they've maxed out on their monthy payment and cant afford other things, 50k cars with part worn tyres barely legal.

I have challenged dealers to prove this to me with the facts and this had never happened. Pcp's do get people into cars they normally would not be able to afford. If customers are happy with this then fair enough. I appreciate that I am in a fortunate position not to rely on Pcp's."
"cruiser said:Cant comment on the above examples but when I use my own q5 as an example ive saved thousands by buying outright. Granted I've kept it 5 years but no matter which way round I do the math PCP is poor value. I'm guessing that's why the dealers don't want to sell you a car anymore they even lose interest when you tell them you don't want pcp.I did however buy my A5 on pcp using the above method, got 3k knocked off and then settled 48 hours later. Guess their making that much off the pcp overall that they can afford to lose on the few of us that settle. The dealer said to me you'd be surprised at the amount of people that say they are going to settle and then never do so we take a gamble.Also working in the industry every day I see people given huge repair bills for damage and mileage penaties to hand back their vehicles if their not taking another car. I'm afraid I don't fancy being held to ransom or anyone telling me how many miles I can drive. Must say Audi aren't anywhere near as bad as merc when giving vehicles back though.Personally I think the whole pcp thing is just creating a bubble, a nation of debt, it basically allows people to drive cars that they cant really afford, everyday I see people distraught and even in tears because they've maxed out on their monthy payment and cant afford other things, 50k cars with part worn tyres barely legal.

That all makes sense to me and has been our position but we are prepared to cancel within the 14 day period to gain a further discount.

"Helisupp said:Apologies if we are going ""off thread"" a bit here, but my sister is blinded by PCP as are many others in my street.I am 59, been retired for 9 years and have always lived within my means, buying the biggest house that we could afford and having 2 old bangers on the drive for over 20 years. Mortgage was paid off by 40 by overpaying each month and not squandering much money at all.There was no PCP system years ago, and I may have been tempted to get a car that I could not afford to buy because all my friends have new cars........even the apprentices at the local company where I worked arrive in new small cars.Its just that I am unable to get through to my sister (who is 53 and broke) that she is constantly living beyond her means, struggling to get by, yet she is driving a new Mercedes.......FFS. I explained to her that if she just got a small Aygo or similar this time she would be better off, but all her friends have Audi or Mercs, so £399 a month it is.An old fashioned bank manager would not have given her the loan for £399 a month.If money was tight, first thing to go would be the cars and back to an old banger (probably more fun anyway parking anywhere and not caring if its scratched or dented).Click to expand...Have to agree... I think we have created an 'entitlement culture' where everyone expects to get anything they want, without working or saving for it!"

Isn’t PCP the thing to drive the next financial crisis?
Could that then lay dealers open to claims they had mis-sold deals? (No doubt they have themselves covered in the small-print!
"The Bank of England has already started to make warning noises about the level of car finance in the UK - and the fact that not enough due diligence is being done by finance companies to ensure that their victims sorry, customers, are in a position to keep up repayments.My guess is that when the real Brexit shock hits us with job losses, higher interest rates, inflation etc, the car finance industry will implode.I can't understand why this country never seems to learn by past mistakes..."
"Hi Folks,We are buying our fifth Q5 but first Mk2. The dealer is trying to persuade us to take out a PCP deal just to gain a further £1000 contribution from Audi. PCP deals are an anathema to us but apparently we can cancel the contract within 14 days and pay-off the agreement without penalty.Does anyone know if this is the case or am I missing something?Many thanks."

"Don't much like the sound of a sub prime car loan crash but I do like the sound of a 'cheap' RS6 - picked up an Italian exotic a few days ago, the owner also had a nice RS6 performance, IMHO a much more desirable car than the fancy 'Fiat.'"
About the original post Audi just offered me the same deal £1500 off if I take PCP. Then pay it off the next day for a £50 cancellation fee. Seams to good to be true why not just give me the discount and let me pay cash which would save Audi the cancellation penalty from the finance company??
"Hi Greasemonger,I went through that very process today with the intention to cancel tomorrow! Don't understand it but it gained a further discount - crazy!"
So there’s no Dodgy dealing or small print to catch you out.
"Apparently not and the T's and C's state that ""I have the right to withdraw from the agreement without giving any reason"". There will be a nominal amount of interest for the few days it is running. I had the T's and C's checked out prior to signing up. Dealers must get enough folk to sign up to PCP's that don't cancel to make their money I suppose."
"What sort of price are you ending up paying off what would be the final retail price by using the PCP deal and then settling shortly after? Has anyone here tried carwow or tried various dealers to see if the deal varies dealer to dealer?One of my friends when he bought a new Yamaha R1 motorbike called what must have been half the dealers in the country asking what the best deal they would do for a sale was, and he found someone near Preston that came out cheapest so used them."
I have tried car wow for comparisons (but never bought from them) and the discounts offered vary from dealer to dealer. Also individual dealers will offer different part exchange prices (if required).As I have said I have not bought from them so can only comment on the initial price comparisons.
Currently DTD is offering 15% off on new Q5s.
"It may seem like semantics, but just to be clear do not CANCEL the finance, just call them and PAY IT OFF/SETTLE it. They are different things with different outcomes. I've had the same situation with a Golf a few years ago, got extra contribution and 2 years servicing by taking VW finance, paid it off a week later and kept the extras.Cheers"

"Hello I’ve just been quoted £460 for the first service on my sq5 diesel. I thought first inspection was basically an oil change. My car has 11000 miles. Seems ott, is it? Thanks Mark."
My car popped up at 7000 miles as it was based on date rather than millage. Went back to staler and they reset and put on flexi service
Seems a bit extended for my liking but my first service isn't due 'till 18K?
Yes it’s 2 years old so due by time.

"Some on here have been 'allowed' to supply their own oil, Costco have a £5 off deal on Castrol oils including Edge 5w-30, think thats the one we use (they've also got 0w-30), which brings it in at under £30 for 4L."
Just had first major and only service at 18600 (SQ5 Plus)Topped the scales at £1500 as I also had 4x new tyres at £247 (they matched best price I had quoted elsewhere) and halfed tracking cost.Ouch !
I paid £490 for the first ever service on my 2016 2.0L TDi at Camberley Audi.I'm sure I paid about £290 on my 2013 2.0L TDi in 2014.
"Mine's going in for it's first service at the end of the month, roughly £390 - £300 if I take my own oil."
"The only reason I ever take my cars to a dealer, is for the dealer history when it comes to re-sell. It's a shame people are so bothered. They're massively overpriced and I'd rather use an independent mechanic or two who I get to know and trust, whose business is built on their reputation and not the badge on their garage.Anything I can do independent like brake pads, tyres, air con, etc then I will. If you're close enough to stevenage and still need your tyres sorting, then N&C Tyres & Exhausts Ltd have sorted the tyres on several of my cars. Nice chap who runs it, mobile service and always good on price.​"
Does anyone use a fuel additive in their diesel Q5 or more specifically SQ5 diesel?If so what do you use?
"Long time ago when I drove a Triumph Spitfire I used to add a little Castrol R, but only for that wonderful smell."
"My last 2 cars both Audi A4 and my current Q5 I always would fill them with BP Ultimate. I pay 7p a litre more than BPs regular diesel, but never had a problem with any of my vehicles no black smoke. Always run smoothly. Even when traveling in France I always try and get some of the premium grade diesels."
I've not used anything in mine and use a variety of fuels; mainly BP (ordinary) or local Tesco's. Runs fine and I get a reasonable mpg for such a car..................
Stick a to main brand fuel and run Ultimate/V-Power every few tanks. This will suffice for keeping things for coking up too badly. Same applies to (T)FSI petrol engines. I wouldn't suggest running an SQ5 on anything other than a premium higher octane fuel.Additives aren't worth the money and on older engines dislodging build up can cause blockages and damage elsewhere.
"Thanks for all the feedback guys. Guess I will stick to the occasional Shell diesel VPower fill-up.I have used Miller's in the past on a VAG diesel engine, not sure how beneficial it was."
I see that that drive the deal are advertising 15% discount off the Q5.
"I worked out that I only got 8%.Plus paint protection package (not worth much), floormats.Cash purchase no PCP contribution."
"Wow, you didn't see those discounts on the 1st Gen Q5!"
"...and they'll throw in a characteristic clang ????In all seriousness that's a healthy discount so soon after launch. Either they are having issues shifting them or the competition is better priced in the first place, or they could well be overpriced..."
Or the market is very flat and they are having to work hard... heard of discounts of over 8% on the brand new not even delivered X3 M40i....Sizeable discounts on most other parts of the Volkswagen group so Audi have to follow or be out of line...
Completely agree Isleaiw!I don't understand why people keep putting the new Q5 down! Go and drive one and you'll realise it's light years ahead of the Mk1 (which is in effect now 10 years old)!
DTD was offering 10-12% on 2018 Q5 before it’s official launch.

I've gone for Replacement Vehicle withGapinsurance.co.ukwhich is Frank Pickles.Which as someone posted above I believe to be better as if I compare the price of my car when I bought it almost 2yrs ago vs price now - the car now is something like £2.5-3k more in price.

"SteveMak said:Just as a data point, Audi's factory wheel are pretty good. When I shopped for 3rd party winter wheels of similar quality, and whose style I liked, I found the price difference to be in the single digit percentage. Yeah, I could save 8% by getting 3rd-party wheels, or I could take advantage of an Audi winter tire package (with wheels). I went the Audi route when I bought by car, and included the Winter Tire Package (in February). I also financed the car and winter tires through Audi at a great deal rather than having to pay for the winters out of pocket, lump-sum.If you do go 3rd party, you will not void your car warranty, providing your wheels and tires do not interfere with the car's brake and suspension components, and the car's bodywork.Many Thanks Stevemak,When I bought my first Q5 I negotiated an extra set of Audi alloys for my winter tyres included in the deal for free!However, with this order they weren't so biddable and were asking 3K! ....

I get GAP insurance to a point however one thing I can't get my head around.Say you have anew Q5 on a 4 year PCP deal and then after 3 months ownership it's stolen.Your insurance company pays you the market value and then with GAP company they pay you the difference between the market value and what you paid? I think that's correct.Once you get that money are you then meant to pay off Audi the remaining finance amount and then you have to go and sort out a new car deal? Or does Audi get you a new car and null your current finance deal as it's been stolen?As I understand you can't clear or pay off the car till halfway through the contract period?Hope that makes sense what I'm saying!
"You would need to check specific GAP wording, they are not all the same. Ask your provider to explain.Most will pay the insurance as if you were voluntarily terminating. You may be entitled to any balance.You can voluntarily terminate your PCP at any time.You can hand the car back only after you have paid 50% of the balance due, not when 50% through the term.A further complication is many insurer's will provide a new car if your is stolen or written off within the first 12 months"

Just because you have a 4wd when the going gets tuff without the correct shoes it's pointless.
"I agree that winter tyres will give the best grip but the quattro (torsen) is a big step up, traction wise, from 2WD on the same tyres. I've seen that video before, it's not a proper 4 wheel drive, the guy himself says that the front wheels have already lost grip before the rears kick in, which kind of defeats the purpose of the test IMO."

"Snow chains cannot be fitted to the new Q5 with the wheels that are supplied (18""). Audi told me that if I need to use snow chains then I need to buy a new set of alloy wheels of a different size! (the track rod clearance is only 10mm)I bought this Q5 thinking it was a truly versatile mountain worthy vehicle and capable of being driven to mountain locations safely in all conditions.However, if you decide to take the car on a skiing trip to Scotland you will not be able to attach snow chains when the conditions dictate.

"Scotland was an example, but we often ski in the Alps where conditions are much worse and chains mandatory above a certain altiude. I agree winter tyres are good but how many people go to that trouble for a holiday."
Snow chains are not mandatory in Austria (or Germany) if you have winter tyres fitted; see:https://www.bmvit.gv.at/en/presse/aktuell/nvm/2015/tyres.html

I lived on the Austrian border for 11 years. The police can stop all cars in bad weather and you put on chains or cannot proceed further. Even with 4x4 and winter tyres. Happened to me a couple of times when skiing. Doesn't mean they are mandatory just means they won't allow you to continue without them which is a bit of a problem when leaving a ski area.Sent from my SM-G900FD using Tapatalk
When you're stuck in the ski car park for the night you'll be able to feel quite smug knowing you didn't carry chains because they're not mandatory. The locals all carry them out of common sense. A Q5 cannot descend an icy road any better than a 2 wheel drive car. That's why the police allow 4x4s to go up the mountain but sometimes enforce chains to go down.Sent from my SM-G900FD using Tapatalk
"'Actual' versus 'local' laws? Ditto France.If the local Gendarme standing in the lay-by thinks your vehicle can cope with the wintry conditions ahead (be it with winter tyres, socks, chains etc). he'll wave you on (occasionally with a smile).If he thinks not, then I'm afraid Monsieur or Madame, the frowning's with you: You'll be going no further. Simples.BTW - best car ever for really snowy conditions? 4WD Fiat Panda with winter tyres.Worst ever? BMW X5 on 335 width summer tyres. Ha Ha Ha...look at meeeeee.... Oh sh1t ...crunch."

My Boxster on its summer tyres is almost impossible on icy roads any slight bend or uphill .... or, thinking about it, any flat straight... and it's sideways before you know it.Anyway, back to the op, I still cannot see why you couldn't fit chains like my Thule ones - why not?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
All down the the width of tires. My Q5 is worse in snow than my previous A4 quattro simply because the winter wheels/ tires are wider. Sporty wide profiles are terrible in snow even with winter tires. Hence why those Pandas work so well in snow.Sent from my SM-G900FD using Tapatalk

"I had spikes spiders on a vRS Octavia Estate many years ago - worked quite well. I've driven to the Alps 15-20 times. Winter tyres are mandatory, carrying chains or some form of attachment highly recommended. It's a hefty fine in some places in the Alps if you aren't carrying chains. I have only ever needed to use them once, ironically the Spiders which took about 2 minutes to fit.Your Audi dealer is talking out of his arse if he thinks chains won't fit.Looking forward to hitting the Alps this year in an A6 Allroad with a proper sized boot."

"I always used standard Michelin chains on my previous A4 Allroad but for the new Q5 the clearance from the track rod at the top of the tyre is only 10mm and most chains are 12 to 16mm overall depth, so not possible.I fully agree coming down the hill is far more onerous than climbing up it, so chains are required when the going gets tough.The chains advice came from Audi UK head office (not a local dealer) so it's company wide policy advice. Buy new wheels was the advice."

"My first set of tyres (P zero's) lasted around 15k, I had to replace all 4 as they had worn fairly evenly. Am now at 22k and they seem to be wearing at a similar rate, i.e. half tread depth gone. Not great really to have to change every 15k and much worse than any other car I have owned."
Ill be happy with 15-20k that should be around 3 years for the miles I do! that's the car nearly a year old and just hit 7000miles Apart from a chunk out the wall protector tyres look good. Do people rotate front to back or is the wear even enough?
"I checked mine the other day and the wear looks pretty even all round so not going to bother rotating them. I'm only on 11k but there's still plenty of life left in them, actually quite pleased with that as I'd read a few horror stories about the Pirelli's longevity."

"I have 20 inch rims. I just passed 26000 miles and have 4mm left on the front and 5mm on the rears - so at a push I would guess I would get 28000, but I am going to change them all soon."
You must wear feather light shoes
I just changed my P zero’s with 25000 miles on them with 3mm of tread left.
Hah that's nothing I got 40K out of my P Zeros.
I am surprised I got 25K the way I drive.
Recall including Q5https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/audi-recalls-127-million-cars-worldwide/ar-BBHeMwg?li=AAnZ9Ug
"This might be worth a read through as who trusts Audi to perform this task, not sure I would.https://www.audiworld.com/forums/q5-sq5-mki-8r-discussion-129/auxiliary-heater-recall-2936151/"
"FYI, Q5s equipped with the optional auxiliary electric heater (might be included in a package) can shut if off using the MMI. There are two settings: (1) Automatic and (2) Off.I found that it stays on when unnecessary if left in the auto position, thereby needlessly consuming more fuel when engine heat could provide the warming rather than the electric heater. So I leave it set to OFF, unless the car is seriously cold and I want to warm up the cabin quickly. It'll stay in the OFF position until I get this recall resolved."
"The first recall for the auxiliary electric heater was addressed entirely via software. This new recall is for a faulty connector, which could result in shorting out or fire. Two separate issues. Two separate recalls (which could be done at the same time, if you did not tend to the first)."
"SM if you read through the posts of the link I posted above they say that many items have to be removed from deep in under the dash to get to this item to be replaced, would trust Audi to return you a squeak free dash after this. I think I'll wait until they have done a few and hear what other owners have to say ......Happy Christmas to one and all ......"

"Hi guys- while we are on the subject of driving in snow and on ice. As I am new to an automatic and the quattro system. If I was going to drive through snow covered side roads and/ or farm tracks etc, would I put the drive select to *off road* or leave it say in comfort mode. I know the drive is set up for FWD as standard and engages all wheels when slip or loss of traction is detected. So what happens when the car is in off road mode ? Are all wheels permanently driving till off road mode is cancelled ? Or does going to off road mode only alter the suspension set up and the quattro system just keeps switching from 2 to 4 wheel drive as required no matter what drive option you have selected. ?"
Winter tyres do offer improved grip on ice. Audi produced a very impressivevideoto demonstrate this
No tyres will save you on black ice you’ll still slide just not as far maybe.
Squeezing your bum cheeks in really tight and smiling like Wallace from Wallace and Gromit usually takes a few feet off the stopping distance if you hit black ice lol. No offence intended to rapport25. Just started early with the xmas spirit- or two

Really? I suspect the love affair with the diesel is waning due to the press scares and the improving economy / performance balance of petrols.After 2 days driving a 530d M Sport over the weekend - one of the best diesels available - I was so happy getting back into my petrol car.
A few other Audi forums (different models) (and VW forums) have had notices from users saying that Google Earth / Google Streetview will be discontinued as of 31/12/17Anyone know if this affects the SQ5 / Q5 vehicles as well?

Following :But I agree with ransman they can't just stop a service that has been paid for surelySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Not heard anything from the stealers or Audi for our A3 or SQ5??
Audi will be discontinuing google earth from December 2020 for MY19 and below models. I think this info is on myaudi.
I can't find it on myaudi
"Navigation & online servicesOnline services are subject to change at any time. Google Earth™ features will not be available after December 2020 for Model Year 2018 and previous Model Year vehicles. ""Google Earth"" is a trademark of Google Inc.The above is from another site ( discussed in USA site)."
I found no similar info on any other Audi site. Could it be just regional limitation? We have already seen a lot of discrepancies on services/features availability in different regions/countries...
"Go to Audi USA. Select Q5. Select view key info under virtual cockpit. Not Q5 specific, applicable to all MY18 and before.Could be regional."
"This is maybe another silly question but again seems wrong to me.In an auto car like the SQ5 you come to a stop with auto handbrake on. Car goes on to auto stop as auto handbrake applies, I then take foot off the brake as car is on autohold and engine stopped, once I take foot off brakes it immediately starts again as it I am ready to drive off.Am I doing something wrong?"
Nothing that you are doing is wrong. As soon as you take your foot off the brake the engine will start even if HHA is engaged and/or the handbrake. It is designed like that. If you select park and remove footbrake engine will stay off.
All seems right to me.
Yes its right if you put the car in park but how often do you do that. I would tend to use autohold if its just a short stop in traffic. In that situation then start stop doesn't work.
"Yeah, its pretty annoying. It would be much better if the engine restarted once you hit the accelerator or something."
If you brake very gently then HHA will come on and Stop/Start won't initiate....
Or just press the over ride button a disabled the fiction all together a real pain if you ask me I would disable it permanently if I could as the amount of fuel and admissions you are saving must be minimal and the extra wear and tear on the starter motor must drastically reduce the life of the part
Stop / Start function is THE most annoying feature on the car.Normal procedure here is key into ignition and then immediately disable the bl00dy thing.

"Brn7yI'm in the shire for another week yet if anyone needs programmingI am installing a tow bar and require the configuration for the electrics to work, tow bar only ordered today."
i know what you are saying it seems like each system is contradicting each other but a necessary evil if you know what i mean. i find myself rushing to take my foot of the brake at junctions before the stop start applies but missing the timing and lurching forward - just takes practice or a quick press of the button.not seamless integration but i like having both options
Liked the idea of stop start but in practise find I'm not stopped long enough for it to make any difference and often find I'm trying to coast up to traffic to prevent it engaging. I switch it off as soon as I get into the car now as it's more of an inconvenience than anything else.
"thats easy - its only engaged if you press full on the brake, you just use light pressure when stopping and it will not turn off the engine."
Coasting up to traffic is a better solution from an economy perspective than using the brakes and having the car stop/start.
Yeah tried that but found myself snatching at the brakes while slowing down as I wasn't applying enough pressure to stop since I was trying to prevent stop start engaging and was getting a bit closer than I would like to the cars in front. Brake pressure modulation isn't my thing. Better drivers probably have no issue with it but it's easier for me to just turn it off.

"I've found it to b as SM ,says ,it only cuts in wen I apply a heavier pressure on the brake,I mussed to how it works and have no problems with it"

Yes just push the button when you start up and it will be off for whole journey. Shame it doesn't have a disable in the MMI menu.
"Off the top of my head, don't they quote figures of 0.4 litres saved per 100km as average?"
Thanks guys.I'm new to Audi (got a 2016 Q5 in January) and have had the engine cut-out on me on many occasions when slowing down at which point I get a warning that the Auto Stop/Start disengages. Over the last 7 months Its been to my dealership a couple of times and I have in touch with Audi UK but to no avail. The Audi technician stated he had one previous case but there was no faulty component and no Audi solution - so any advice is much appreciated and the Forum really works for me.
"I bought a carista only so I could disable start/stop (well, technically, it remembers the previous setting, which is *OFF*, when you start the engine).Well worth £20 and I'm sure I've saved a ton of wear and tear on the engine, starter and battery..."
"I'm trying to decide which version to buy, I love the more updated interior of the new car, and after a 24 hour test drive I think it is a fabulous car all round, except that I want everything it offers but with a whisper quite mode if that makes sense.

Really? I have the same car and can't hear the exhaust - except on start up or in sport mode with my foot down (when of course it is because I want to!) on a long motorway journey it is quiet and refined....Doesn't the BiTDi have the sound channelled through the speakers so you can hear the fake exhaust more?
I like the throaty rumble the SQ5 makes. If you don't go for the 3.0TDI it is nearly as quick and much more refined.

"The BiTdi lump as good as it is has some serious issues surrounding the intake flap and the intake manifold, the way the EGR woks cokes up the intake really bad and its a big job to strip it all down and clean it when it does get to the point the intake flap sticks, once this happens it throws the car into limp mode and its either clean parts or replace parts to resolve.I am not aware of the V6 petrol lump having the same issues and with the newer interior and exterior styling I would be going new SQ5 all day long."

I was considering changing to Macan diesel but dpf problems seemed quite common.Wouldn't normally change after 10 months but work mileage changed so GTS started to cost fortune in fuel so decided to get out with reasonable loss.

Based on fuel costing around 110-15 pence/l over 3 years the difference in fuel costs for my SQ compared to a car doing mid 20's is less than a grand, in 3 years..

"The other factor for me choosing petrol was the current swing away from diesels becoming more noticeable in the press etc, and I think it will only get worse.Also, in 2020 I believe the shipping industry is having to change from their current cheap and nasty fuel and will switch to diesel, which will probably mean an increase in diesel pricing."

"Previous comments are great points and on the money regarding the limited competition against the diesel SQ. I do still think the petrol SQ is the best of the current bunch of similar sized performance SUV's considering engine performance, interior quality and technology. Macan is a great car but so outdated already internally. Compare it to other competitors and it's like looking at a 10 year old car."
"SteveMcB said:Also ( I'm led to believe) it's being discounted already which is unusual for a brand new model and will impact on residuals, so although it's cheaper to buy than a decent Macan GTS I suspect the depreciation will be a lot more, ie the GTS could actually work out cheaper in the long run?Bottom line though is they're all great cars, if you're happy with what you're driving all is good and I wouldn't criticise anyone's choice, we all have different needs/budgets.33;Click to expand...I looked at the GTS and got prices - I reckoned about £7k extra over 4 years for not dissimilarly specced cars for the GTS although the financing was different as GTS was done via Clydesdale and it's not a GFV.

cheaper diy option is making a pouch using the foil paper.
I bought a pouch (ok it was eBay) and it didn't work
Keyless entry only.Rappy.
"Sorry. Unless I'm missing something?????.This topic is about keyless entry cars. If your car does not have it you are safe.How will the signal booster allow the thief to gain entry, if you don't have keyless entry?.Rappy."
Keyless only.. Tricks the car into thinking the key is very close and opens it. Remote locking needs the fob button to be pressed and unless someone has copied your fob these are pretty safe.
Agree. I thought I had missed something.Thanks for confirming.Rappy.
There seems to be a spate of burglaries to steal the car keys. Some don't lock our doors during the day whilst at home and many of us keep our keys near the door.
"Seems to be a fine line between making it difficult to steal without taking the unnecessary steps of concealing the keys at night. Personally, if someone comes into my home then they had better be ready to take some pain back.. I value my car but if a man's family is put at risk.....Unfortunately these scumbags are often tooled up ready."
Oh thought the keyless start may still transmit some short distant signals.It makes sense it's only for keyless entry.
Me too. Great product
I always leave my keys in the kitchen (not keyless) generally if their coming for my car they can have it. House has alarm n cctv if they enter then they usually be after something specificIf keys upstairs that's where theyll come and I want them as far away from my kids as poss.Got my car insurance and gap so car can be replaced.

That's ridiculous...have they given you any reasons at all? Emden Quality Control still?
Ransman - When was your build date? Mine was week 11 and reached dealer on 25th May.
"stevew said:If all that info is true, then I think your car will hold the record for delivery time from order!!!!Are you sure your car actually left on a ship on 19th May or was it a case that it just left the factory? When Audi UK say it is 'in transit from the factory', the car still needs to reach the port, be released to ship and then actually leave the port!Turnaround time in Emden seems to differ greatly. Mine took around a week, others 7 weeks or longer I think.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...Well my YourAudi account said that it was on it's way on the 19th May 2017, and I had a look at vehicle carriers that were leaving for the ports mentioned on YourAudi account, so I guessed it was that vehicle carrier and have followed it for the past week or so. I could be wrong and have a longer wait but the dealer said it was on it's way and it takes 15 weeks from leaving Mexico, so I have sort of filled the blanks myself due to lack of information from Audi.Can't believe that others have to wait even longer, I honestly don't know how everyone is coping ha ha"
"Build week commencing 6th April, then in quality control until 30th May, then left factory 31st May heading to the port, hope you have better luck with Audi UK customer service who rung to update me today (did not know what the status of my vehicle was, I told her) all they could advise was an estimated delivery of July or August."
"Nemo said:Hey Chad, yup you'll see a few threads here with regards these delays but other than a few issues I don't think there's a single owner on here who isn't loving their car right now...That's quick...3 weeks on from ordering and yet to hear about an order number - think someone had posted Audi stopped 'processing orders' whilst they caught up. They also delayed launch of MY18 cars to at least week 28 when rest of Audi range converted as normal on week 22.I thought this only recently changed for MY18 cars which aren't even being built yet...Make sure you also get a refund for these packs and just pay for rear camera.

Maybe nip in to the local Audi centre and speak to them, see what the situation is."
LOL
Build week 9 - dealer is investigating.
The considerable delays sound to me like Germany are dismantling and rebuilding every single Mexican built Q5!

"Hi ChazAudi199155-- the ship 'Viking Qeen' arrived in Emden from Veracruz/Jacksonville/Davisville on the 4th June. The next ship due into Emden from Veracruz/Jacksonville/Davisville is the 'Adriatic Highway' on or around the 13th June. Updates can be 3-5 days out, and ships have been taking 16-19 days to arrive in Emden from Veracruz. I would think given your departure date that your car would have been on the Viking Qeen and is now in Emden. How long it spends in Emden seems to be a bit of a lottery judging by some other delivery times to dealers from Emden quoted in this forum. I waited six weeks before it was put on a ship for Tyne, others have been shifted within 7-10 days. Best of luck for a speedy delivery to the dealers."
"I ordered mid January and dealer placed order on Jan 27. Initial build schedule was for week of May 8th, but finally car build was completed on May 29. And I do have Top View cameras specced - no changes to my order were insisted on me. So I hardly believe timing given by dealer is reasonable. Frankly speaking my first thought is that you were cheated; possibly they offered you a car build for someone else (with different specification, so no Top View cameras), who revoked order (fast build time)..."
What are 'Top-View' camera's?
"4 cameras mounted in front, rear and under side mirrors. Images from all 4 are combined on MMI screen giving impression of viewing the car from the top. This is whatChazAudi199155was referring to as 360 degrees parking cameras. At lest this is the name under which these are marketed in Poland."
Used to be called TopView here originally as well but recently changed to 360 Cameras like other manufactures ????????
"Ah OK, now I get ya.Any good?"
"Works fine, but you have to change the view on the camera/screen which makes it a pain..Kinda like drive select, its a toy you use once, then Meh.. done that."
"So it seems that every so many, a car is chosen for 100% top to bottom inspection. Guess whose has been picked!Still no firm date but the salesman was told it might even be August! He has requested a loan Q5 for me and he should have an answer by the end of the week and I can then make up my mind between keeping the current one until the new one eventually arrives or swapping into the loaner. The decision isn't as straightforward as it seems as I would have to fit a temporary set of hand controls to drive it and I am planning a road trip of around 1,000 miles in late July and I would not really want to do it on those controls if I can avoid it."
"At least, on the plus side, it ""should"" be right when it eventually arrives!"
"That's why I put ""should"" in inverted commas"
"Well I turned down the loaner as I was told it would be a current Q5. TBH I am not sure he knew what he was talking about as he referred to it as being an old model Q5 but a Sport - I think he was confused but I didn't see it worth taking the risk so I opted to stay with my current car.I know see that ""YourAudi"" tracker has my car showing as being in the UK. That was almost guaranteed to happen after I had just filled the tank!"
So hopefully driving next week
Not holding my breath. The salesman said he would have about ten days warning of it leaving Germany!!!! Left hand/right hand springs to mind.

"Ordered 1st week in Jan........still waiting. Dealer info next to zero. If i didn't really want it, i'd cancel the order."
"Things seem to be getting worse instead of better since Audi moved to Mexico. They know if they tell potential customers how long their car may take, the customer is likely to walk out the showroom. The only way to beat the wait is try to get an ex demo with decent spec. But as most customers want a fresh new car it's not an ideal alternative. Are the delivery times for Merc,BMW or Jag etc any better ? This hassle of not being able to track your car and little or no info from the dealerships leading up to eventuall delivery, certainly took the shine off getting my new car. The niggles and faults that arrived with it didn't help either."

"I had same issue with my dealer, in the end I just spoke to Audi CS, in the end I was updating my dealer with regular updates! Once they have you order they aren't that bothered."
Audi better sort themselves out as the new BMW X3 is coming...http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bmw/x3/90843/new-2017-bmw-x3-suv-details-prices-and-pics
Gutted they have proper decent interior door handles on the new X3 instead of the plastic ones on the Q5!
"Picked the new car up last Thursday and, guess what, the air conditioning has failed. Taking it back in tomorrow.Fuller report on everything in due course."
So the aircon needs regassing and Audi have just changed the spec so the garage have to order more in - taking it back on Wednesday.I was told there is a recall on the rear head rests associated with excess material being used and potentially blocking the runners. Whilst mine move OK it still has to have the check done and that damages the runners which then need to be replaced. I might leave that to be done later and insist on a loaner.Sounds like the salesman is getting me a free boot liner for today's trouble.
"Skiman said:Audi are really p-----g a lot of people off with this car. The list of faults grows every other week. My latest quality grumble is that although I have had the car only a couple of months, due to the cheap and thin car mats supplied, I already have a 'dent' in the main carpet below the mat where my heel sits at the accelerator. Another example of cost cutting it seems. I am going to look for mats which have a more solid rubberised heel area or put something below the mat like a section of thin plastic sheet to spread the weight over a bigger area. Also in the boot, the removable floor cover is showing signs of fraying. And the most I have had in there were a couple of shopping bags twice a week tight against the rear seat held in place with a stretchy luggage cable hooked to either side.I like my car and the way it drives etc, but once the new BMW X3 is in the showrooms, I will be paying them a visit to compare the interior fiinish and materials used (especially the door facings)Click to expand...When I negotiated the deal on my Q5, once I was happy with the figures I said to the sales guy if you throw in a set of premium car mats I will shake on the deal now which he duly did. They are much better. The original mats will be used during the muddy winter months. If others are thinking of a new Q5 I would try this tactic, I would be amazed if the dealer is prepared to loose a sale for the price of a set of mats."
"I guess it's down to personal taste, really don't like rubber mats though I do acknowledge they are practical."

Random question for this thread - how long was the gap between order moving to stage 3 (I.e locked) and in to build Stage 4?In the past it's between 3-4 weeks but looking at the post within here it's been 10days and 2 weeks to go to our Q5 build it's still in 'Order Received' stage
"Hi Nemo-- when I ordered my car back in November 16 I was told the 'lock' stage when you cannot change the specs you ordered, went from 6 weeks to 10 weeks because the car was being built in Mexico. Don't know if that timeline still applies in light of delivery problems being encountered by fellow members. It seems things run smoothly from ordering through to the start of collating equipment, then through the body shop / paint / assembly onto build date. It was around 10 days from gathering 'parts' to going through the build process which ended in my allocated build date. The way things are going, there seems to be no viable reason why some orders are taking longer than others to complete after being ordered around the same time."

"Hi Nemo - the build date I got was the date the car was completed, rather than the date the build would statt. Around 10 days before my build date I started getting updates in the 'your Audi' factory tracker telling me it was in the body shop then paint shop etc etc till it was moved through to Q/A the day after my build."
Hi Hatter55 welcome to the forum. My car was one of the early batches and was in Emden for 6 weeks supposedly getting extra quality checks before being transported to Tyne. It took 4 days after the ship docked in Tyne for my car to arrive at the dealers. Some members had their cars within 10-14 days from arrival in Emden. There seems to be no positive timescale or information in place as to how cars are handled once in Emden. What was the name of the ship as I cannot see any vessels moored in Emden that arrived from Mexico.
"Hatter55 said:Hello, i'm new to the forum and have been reading the thread regarding waiting times for new Q5 orders. There's been some great advice so thank you for that.I placed my order at the end of March and the car got built by end of May which was lucky. However since 7 June its been stuck on ""Left San Jose"" and Status 30 stage which means its in transit to Emden. However Audi kindly gave me the cargo ship its one and upon tracking has shown its been moored at Emden for over a week. The dealership had even less information than me but they are saying the car could take up to 22 weeks for inspection and transport. I've never heard anyone waiting that long once it arrived in Emden.Has there been any further updates about the expected time from Emden to UK please?ThanksClick to expand...Hi, you're on a very similar timeline to our original order. Bad news about status 30 is that it's left the factory but is still waiting to get onto a ship. Ours is at the same point with no estimated arrival date other than the standard upto 12 weeks response.It's a long time to wait but hopefully be worth it once it arrives."
Audi just tell customers anything to get them off their backs. They haven't a clue where your car is and would rather spin you a story than admit their failings. You will be have a better idea of a timescale once you get your update telling you it has left Mexico for the UK via Jacksonville and Davisville.
"I achieved a healthy discount plus rubber mats front and rear + load liner without needing to push very hard. In my opinion, rubber mats are the only way to go and I've never paid for them! This car will spend a great deal on time in the mountains and on the coast."

The YourAudi tracker is not very reliable, so don't read to much into it. Mine is on the drive and still showing as in transit to the UK."
"Keep in mind the tracker is designed for European manufacture. 'Left the factory' usually means en route to Emden by train from Germany, Hungary or Spain which takes a few days at most. Unfortunately for the Q5 this single step covers the train from San Jose to Veracruzanda trans-Gulf/Atlantic shipment to Emden with several calls at US ports (plus secondary QC) giving the impression of no change in status for weeks."
"Just as an update, my car - ordered mid March, built circa 20th May - has now moved to status 38 on that 'behind the scenes' tracker. Ithinkthis means that it's at the dock in Germany awaiting a ship to the UK. I suspect from what Justanhonestman and others have said that once it's actually on the ship, the 'Your Audi' tracker will at last update to show that the car is on its way to the UK.At least it seems to be on the right continent now, which is progress!DH"
"Build starts in 2 weeks so effectively 10 days time and the order still hasn't been locked on the tracker - let's see what happens.Maybe the 2.0TFSI engine issue Justanhonestman man posted about in the VED section is going to be an issue, who knows ????‍♂"
"Hi Nemo -- as SteveMcB and christuffleyQ5 wrote - the cars are based on their emissions when registered and nothing happened after deiselgate. The band that the 2.0 ltr tfsi petrol is in covers CO2 emissions from 151-170. As the figure for this engine is 157, they have a bit to play with before it would jump a band. So your car should not be affected. Hopfully you don't wait too long for your car."
Hi My Q5 status just updated to show in transit. How long does it take from this point to arriving in the UK?
"Hi Dermu-- that's a question that could be answered many times from different people. There does not seem to be any fixed timescale or logic once the car leaves Mexico. If your car is on a ship and has left Mexico, it takes around 16-20 days to arrive in Emden (depending on sea conditions and weather). After that it's anybody's guess. My car was stuck in Emden for 6 weeks before shipping to the UK. Other people got their car within a couple of weeks of it arriving in Emden. If you read back some of the previous posts you will see what other members of the forum went through before getting their car. Hope you don't have to wait too long."
"Hi Dermu My car showed left Mexico, but did not change to on its way to UK until it left Emden, It was in Ebden for just a few days before arriving in UK"
Up to 12 weeks!!! Wow! This Mexico is thing really isn't panning out particularly well for Audi.
Woh. That's way too long wait. Any options for a courtesy car?
"stevew said:Agreed Chaz, I was getting the hump with it all and because they're so vague it makes it worse!I can say with a lot of confidence that your car isn't in Emden yet though mate (sorry!)Have you tried the 'other tracker' that gives you the codes?Not sure if this works but there is a post from yapstar in the discussion 'Got my brand spank Q5' where he gives a link to it and it provides a little bit more info.

My cars build date was 16th of this month but was built early. Took literally 4 days to quality control and 3 days from quality control to show in transit. So from what I see they are building ahead of projected build dates but there may be a logistic issue which is causing delays
My car was ordered in Feb and showed as in transit from Mexico on 20th April then didn't show as arrived in Emden until end of June.It then moved quite quickly to being shipped to the U.K. within a few days.I've been offered the car for collection or delivery from the 27th July and am collecting from the dealer on 31st July.
Hopefully it should be here soon Nemo
"Hi Nemo - they really want to get rid of this tracker system till they have something in place that actually works and can give the customer the information they require. But of course they don't want to highlight any delays in production or logistical problems and delays at the ports etc. It's so frustrating for the customer, but hang in there."
We had even less information when waiting for our F Pace. The dealers seemingly have no idea where the car is until it turns up on a trailer. It arrived almost a month early with zero warning!
Great news! Is your build week this week (31?)Mine was last week and looking at background tracker went in to QC on Monday 24th and left factory on 2/8 so in theory over a week in QC - never know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
Yes was scheduled for this week (31) since the beginning of June. Pleased it's not a Friday afternoon car and hopefully it will pass through the next stage as quickly as yours......Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

Ahhh now another tracker to watch....What was your build week and do you know if your car is still at status 30 or has it moved along in the background audi tracker?
Mine was built on week 29. Have not checked on the background tracker as of yet.
My car is still in quality control (3 weeks and counting). Does anyone know the usual duration? The dealer says that audi U.K. are stating it can take up to 24 weeks to get from build to delivery!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Hi, mine was delivered fairly quickly from arriving in Emden then getting to the dealers. It supposedly had lots of checks and inspections in Mexico, Emden and a PDI at the dealers but I'm now a bit sceptical. After having the car for a week and putting 200 miles on the clock I checked the tyre pressures, they should be 33psi, they were 36, 38, 39 and 46. If something as basic as this was missed then perhaps we are all being fed a load of B. S. about the reason for delayed deliveries."
"Yep-- the dealers are more or less in the same position as the customer regarding tracking info. Once you get your update that the car has left Mexico, you at least know it's heading your way and you can track it to Emden. Hope it doesn't take to long for you. Cheers"
And this is why I try to buy stock cars - have cancelled two cars previously when the delays become intolerable. It also stops me getting too carried away ticking options boxes for things that I will never use but sound good at the time....
"Mjr2004 said:thanks for the insight. I'm not particularly patient and the dealer is being optimistic but cautious. I just want to know when to sell my car....

Comment from the dealer is:I have called Audi UK this morning because the last time I heard anything about the shipping times they were stating 12 weeks from the build to get through all the different quality checks , which I think I mentioned in a previous email, however this morning they are saying it can be up to 24 weeks.I would like to think the car would come through sooner than this however I can only feedback the information I have been given and keep tracking the progress and as we go through the process we will be able to be more accurate.Im sorry this will not be information you would have like to have heard and my apologies that there may be a delayed delivery date, however it is still early days and we may very well find the car will be through for November as originally planned.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...My dealers have been getting Q5s quicker than expected - don't ask me though what they expect vs how quick they arrive but they'd said they'd seen an improvement...Ours left factory whenever I posted the screenshot (2-3 weeks ago) was build week 30 I think (24th July) and still on status 30 on the background tracker when I checked earlier this week.To be honest so busy with work don't get time to check ????"
Had an email today from the dealership. My car will be ready for collection within 2 weeks from today. My build week was 29.

"I would try for a refund on the options that you paid for that have become standard fitment now. They may just say you got the car you ordered according to what the spec was at the time.

My car has arrived in the UK. Not sure how much longer till I can pick up the car. Tbh it's been quicker than originally imagined. I know for some people it's taking longer.
"Mine arrived at the dealers within 10 days of landing in the UK, 2 days later I collected it. Good luck."
Yup same car is in Uk dealers think they'll have by the end of this week so let's see.As you say it's come much sooner than expected - ordered sometime in May and let's say delivery by end of next week so 4months? Not bad given all the early signs that were saying 9months just after we ordered

Still think it could be a tracker delay.On our the once the status was 'Order Received' the tracker never updated until it had left the factory if I remember correctly.My guess is that it's a tracker delay rather than anything untoward.Speaking to the dealers last week they were pretty honest and said they have actually no accurate idea where a car is until it reaches Germany. The tracking at Mexico side is really really poor. They were also surprised at the speed at which the Q5s were arriving. They had been told expect up to 24 weeks from BW for the car to get to you but this hasn't been the case recently.Fingers crossed it is just a tracker delay - have you checked the background tracker at all? ????????Click to expand...Hi Nemo.thanks for the reassurance. Yes, background tracker says the same. I don't mind waiting but I am wanting to know when to sell my BMW.I'm imagining the tracker saying it's still at the factory and the dealer phoning one morning to say, we've got your car now, come and pick it up at the weekend......Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"You can tell dealer, that is not convenient and agree a date to pick up............................. If you can resist"
????????????
Am now Status 30! 6 weeks in quality control. Not sure if that is a good or a bad thing!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Picked mine up on the weekend. So far so good no problems. Feels alot lighter than the old Q5 which I also used to own before this. MPG is miles better. And no break servo problem hope it stays that way! Good luck to those waiting.
Glad you're liking it and that its trouble free. What model and spec did you get?
I bought the sports trim with the addition of 19inch rims and privacy Windows in ibis white. Wanted to spec it below 40k.
"Still no sign of my TFSI S Line (all I know is that it's somewhere between the factory and Emden) , but I have got a loan new Q5 with only 300 miles on the clock. First impressions of the TDI are positive. Refined, comfortable, easy to manoeuvre and good power on the motorway. Negatives would be power delay when setting off and standard sat nav. Overall very impressed and it's quite effortless to drive.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"I am pleased to report that my diesel S line, ordered on 12 June, was delivered to me on Friday, 6 October. I was worried that, since it has quite a few extras, it was especially vulnerable to delay, but am pleasantly surprised. Very impressed with the car so far. Only gripe, didn't know it came with roof bars, so I had bought a set in readiness."
"Pleased your new motor has arrived in a pretty quick time frame, hope you continue to enjoy it. Just check your brake pedal to ensure it doesn't make the clanking noise that some of us have experienced."
"Pleased to say there is no ""beer can"" noise from the brakes, it was the first thing I checked in the showroom before I took delivery."
Sorry guys been away from forums for a few days as a little person entered our worlds and it's been a little hectic!Mike congrats on new carJustanhonestman our car doesn't have the illuminated cup holders that I've seen anyway. ????????
Hi Nemo thanks for the reply and congrats to everybody on your new arrival. We will have to start a child seat thread next lol. Cheers
Congrats @nemo on your the new arrival.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Justanhonestman said:Hi MikeWM can you tell us if the cupholders between the front seats are illuminated. The reason I ask is when I placed my order last November illuminated cupholders were part of the extended light package costing £150. When I and others took delivery of our cars, the cupholders were not illuminated. The dealer shrugged this off as a mistake in the configurator. I notice the configurator has stopped listing the cupholders as illuminated in the extended light package, but is listing them as standard fitting on the Q5. So either they are now fitting illuminated cupholders as standard now, or the configurator is still wrong. While in talks with Audi C/S about my brake pedal noise, I complained about the cupholders being listed wrongly. C/S said they will look into this and report back when they phone me to find out if my master brake cylinder replacement has worked.Click to expand...As far as I can see, the cupholders are not illuminated, but it's hard to be certain in daylight, I'll write again if that changes. My car does not have the upgraded illumination package."
Hi guysInteresting thread!! I've checked my Q5 and the cup holders are illuminated. Obviously I wouldn't really care too much if they wasn't as I didn't pay to have it not did i actually know they light up until instead this thread forcing me to pay a little more attention to it. But for those who have paid for them it it's pretty snakey of Audi to rob you like that. FYI I have the basic led interior lighting.
Hi MikeWM thanks for the feedback. It doesn't look like they have started to include illuminated cupholders as standard as their configurator says. The top of the cupholders would have a recessed groove around the circumference of the cupholder which the lighting is positioned into. Gives me ammunition when C/S phone. Cheers.
"I have now checked in the dark and there are definitely no lights around the cupholders. I can feel the grooves you are referring to, but no light coming out of them!"
Hi DermuCan you post a pic. When I contact sales they said it was an error in the online manual. Need to take the guns out.
Q7 don’t have cup holder lighting either.
But the A3 does ...However Dermu says his car doessounds like a Mexican pot luck!You sir can have illuminated cup holdersYou sir a tin can around the brake pedal
"Hi guys-- am I right in saying the mk1 S-line plus model had illuminated cupholders. This would explain why Dermu and his 2014 model have lights and we don't. Ahhh the joys of progress. When I placed my order the extended light package listed the cupholder lighting included in the £150 package. That has now been removed but is still listed as standard fitment in the interior lighting in the configurator, which we all now know is wrong."
Didn’t realise it was MK1.
I've got the 67plate. And yes I'll upload a pic or 2 once I figure out how to.
Dermu - use Tapatalk app as the website is not allowing for any pic uploads.
Hi Dermu sorry for any confusion. Below your posts it reads that you have a 2014 Q5 S- Line Plus but you say you have a 67 plate on.
Dermu what was your build week? Ours was 30 and doesn’t have them.
I was told months ago that it wasn't going to appear on the Q5. Another lie by Audi clearly. At the time managed to get another 1K back from them for the issue.
"Hi Dermu,Any chance you could post pictures? I'm back onto the dealer! Thanks in advance."
That is quite shocking
Coming via the Bermuda Triangle?
"Lost within more like .... Honestly, its just absolutely crazy, if I didn't have the order tracker no one would believe it."

"Hi everyone,I'm in the market for a new SQ5 and was wondering if anyone had any experience comparing 20s and 21s on the new model? I took a 21"" for a tets drive recently and felt like I could feel every little bump, to the extent it didn't feel like a quality ride in any way. I'm used to driving hot hatches with fairly stiff suspension so I was surprised how firm it was.I've been trying to find a 20"" demo but they all seem to have 21s. Can anyone speak to the ride comfort in the 20s?Thanks all!Greg"
"I just took a SQ5 on standard springs and 21"" rims out and decided that I need 20's and air suspension if I buy one...Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk Pro"
"I can only speak from experience of a Mark 1 SQ5 Plus - I have the OEM 21"" wheels for summer use, with a second set of 20"" shod with winter tyres.Country roads around Warwickshire and Northamptonshire are sh1t at the best of times but I would concede that the rise is a little less harsh on the 20's - though to be expected with more tyre wall to dampen things."
Mine is on 20” wheels and I think the ride is just fine.
"Mine is on 21s and std springs and I think the ride is just fine - and I came to it from a Volvo, an A6 on 18s, and a Mini...."
"Hi,My Q5 has a factory rear hitch and I want to use my bike rack with it ... do I need to turn off or change any of the rear sensor settings? Asking because my previous car required you to disable the backup alarms because it thought the rack was something in the way and hit the brakes (a Jeep Grand Cherokee).Thanks!"
Never used my bike rack on the SQ5 but if it's a factory tow bar I don't think you'll need to do anything so long as the bike rack has lights. Once the light bar's plugged in the car will think it's towing something so should automatically switch off the reversing sensors etc.
"In any event, you can manually switch off the reversing sensors."
"No lights on the rack, so I'll turn off the reverse sensors, thanks"
"My previous 09 plate had a windscreen sun visor strip across the top like many other cars. This is missing on my new 67 plate. Any reason, as it was useful, particularly low winter sun days."
I had similar on my 2009 Q5. They stopped doing that sometime before 2013.
"My 2016 66 Plate SQ5 Plus, has the strip. I guessed it was just standard on all Q5's.Very strange!. I'm guessing cost cutting.Rappy"

Hi AllDoes the navigation system show you the speed limit on the mapsI have seen there Is a option for camera recognition o speed signs but assume that is slightly different?Please let me know as I still have the option o edit my order!Thanks
"Yes the speed limit is shown on the central display. I have driven 3 2018 Q5s in the last 2 weeks. 1 loan, 1 mine, 1 other loan and they all show the speed limit on the lower right hand side of the displaySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

"Mine definitely uses the cameras, albeit not perfectly. I was in a 40mph limit then did a u-turn into a 20mph limit side road before returning along the 40mph limit. The cameras picked up the 20 limit and did not correct it until we passed the first 40mph sign some way along the main road."

"Got ads installed, a question. I set it on mms to comfort, switched off engine and checked and found it had returned to dynamic, which it was at before I moved to comfort.Is something wrong with installation?Thanks"
Which guide did you follow? I've just installed it on a friends Sq5 it remembers his last setting which is individual. I did find a couple of variations of the coding in the end I follwed this guide on YouTube.
Thanks for posting this - really easy to follow and worked fine on mine - great to have the exhaust noise on/off at the turn of a knob. I like it/her indoors doesn't!
"My lease is for 6000 miles per year, I could care less about saving a polar bear (your mileage may, ahem, vary)My Jan 2017 SQ5+ is averaging 26MPG after 3,900 miles. Not surprised or unhappy as I bought it for some spirited driving.This is the opposite of the ""I can do 40/50MPG"" threads - what are you seeing in real life while maximising the exhaust noise?"
"I'm averaging about 32mpg according to the trip computer. That's a mix of all types of driving and a love of the loud pedal! Ok mine's not the plus, but I reckon you'll improve a bit on those stats as the engine beds in. Mine is just shy of of 30k and 3.5 yrs old."
"When I had a BMW R1100S motorcycle, I did an experiment in which I rode one tank in a very spirited manner, and another at cruise at 55 MPH. The spirited driving got around 25 MPG (US), while the cruise got over 50 MPG (US). I have not done the same in my Q5, but I would not be surprised to see a huge difference like this."
Were you towing a bus?
"LOL, one of the new petrol Levante's, it does sound quite good though!"
"I would actually call this thread ""badge ofdishonour"" :-(On the other side of the coin, after an 80 mile trip today I had my FC showing 68.4mpg, and my calculations show this it to be within 2%. I did have a tailwind mind you!"
"I searched, but couldn't find a thread already.Who has the highest mileage Q5? Include previously owned vehicles.I ran my 2006 A6 Avant S Line for 4 years and up to 170k miles. Mechanically and cosmetically it was perfect - other than servicing and standard running costs it was imperious. The best and most reliable car I have owned to date. I miss that car!The Q5 I have had for the last 4 weeks I am hoping will achieve similar greatness (in my mind) the early indications are very good."
That's some mileage! Did you end up selling your A6 or scrapping it?
Traded it in at an Audi dealer for £4.5k! Against an A4 Avant which was the car before this Q5. Modern engines and respectful servicing should easily see these kind of figures. I got in a private hire vehicle a few years ago in Birmingham (Merc Estate only 4-5 years old) the driver took delight in telling me his car had over 330k miles on the clock! Looked like new inside leather upholstery all in good condition.I'm hoping to run this Q5 up to a similar levelWe recently bought a VW T4 Camper - people were describing vehicles with 300k miles as 'low mileage' ha ha
My 2004 a4 tdi sport went well until 90k then started to fall apart and by 120k wasn't looking healthy at all. My Q5 at 30k is so so already having suffered the exact same rear wiper failure the a4 suffered from. So 10 years on audi haven't done anything to resolve it. Im not very hopeful the q5 will see a high mileage especially the transmission. My sister in laws kia sorento (apart from terminal rust) outlasted my bmw x3 so premium doesn't = longevity in my analysis.
"Mines is sitting on 86k miles currently, and has had a few things replaced\repaired. Nothing major though!"
That's good to hear! I got mine on 64.5k it's now on 69k in 5 weeks. Running well with no issues.
109K here on a 2.0TDI.........
How long do your tyres last?
"Believe it or not, I had approximately 80K miles out of my first set of tyres (Goodyear Excellence). They were great tyres. I'm not doing so well on the second and current set (Bridgestone).The Bridgestone tyres seems much softer than the Goodyear and are wearing faster - I guess I might see 45K out of these.Another interesting point is the MPG on the Bridgestone's is 10% lower than the Goodyear - I have two sets to rims so I swapped them back and forth to compare."
"80k out of one set of tyres,that surely must b a record on the forum"
"Mine is currently at 50k (hard) miles and not quite 2 years old (2.0 TDi) and it is still feeling like new.Some say that the VAG group diesels get better over 150k miles, and I know of VAG group diesel engines with over 300k miles on them with just regular servicing + consumables.J"
Mine is now up to just under 89k - still no issues - fingers crossed!
22k miles in 19 months - engine is bedded in nicely.
Now on 120K miles and still on the original pads and discs....
"Now on 90k miles.Had a few non mechanical issues torn sun roof wind deflector, sun roof which juddered badly (going in for re greasing on Monday) and some rust on the tailgate - which has been repainted and dealt with under the anti corrosion body warranty.Mechanically it has been spot on."
"I know I new to this forum and to Audi ownership, but thought I would add my 2 cents. I recently purchased a 2010 Q5 3.2L and it has 84K miles on it now and runs and looks brand new. I get a lot of complements on the appearance and everyone is shocked when I tell them it's a 2010 as the say that it looks much newer.I have had many, MANY cars around in my driving life and I really enjoy everything about this vehicle and hopefully it runs well for me for many more years."
Nearly at 130k miles now and still on the original pads and discs.........
"I searched, but couldn't find a thread already.Who has the highest mileage Q5? Include previously owned vehicles.I ran my 2006 A6 Avant S Line for 4 years and up to 170k miles.

"Thats impressive, just replaced all mine at 63k miles!"
Service your car regularly when the light flashes. Change things as and when needed even the littlest of things make sure they are genuine parts. Look after your car and it will look after you. I never chance anything. I've never had a problem with any of my motors.
137K Miles and climbing.........
"Not really gotten a load of KM's on Q5 yet, but the A3 2.0 TDI is running strong at 330k KM's (on average 33k KM's a year) with no more issues than the default replacements that need to be done at certain service intervals, 2 replaced rear wipers and some light bulb replacements."
Now 150K miles now.....
125k just gone for an MOT. Adaptive Cruise control still doesn't work - It's a poor system that seems prone to failure and few Audi dealers have the equipment to set it up. No other issues to report - pads and discs were done about 5k miles ago.Long term average has dipped to 29.7mpg damn that dynamic setting!
"I've never had a car do more than about 30k on pads, and tyres that last 80k miles, WHAT!!! Thats insane, must be driving these cars on carpets!I once bought a Cavalier SRi (in 1988) with 135k miles on the clock, 2 years later I sold it to a garage with nearly 150k on, although running great.... A few months after I sold it I got a knock on the door from the local bobbies asking me to confirm I had owned it, and could I also confirm if the mileage was indeed 69000 miles at the time... Naughty dealer... Those were the days"
130k now and no issues. Re-map has given me a grin ????????
"160,000 Miles......"
"160,000 Miles....."
"1,37,000"
"My old 1998 A4 Avant 1.9TDI Quattro is apparently still going strong. I sold it in 2005 when it had done 120k and the last I heard (several years ago) it was up at about 185k, so probably over the 200k mark by some distance now."
"Well, my Q5 went last week, just shy of 140k. So I'm passing the baton on for this thread. A decent innings and enjoyable ownership. I thought the Q5 was excellent and pretty faultless with the odd exception.But I can definitely see a long term future in this A6 Allroad."
"If anybody wants to know how their previous car is doing. As long as it has the same number plate, you can check a cars MOT on the yougov site. Just google ‘check an mot’ and you should see the yougov site. Tap in the number plate and all the MOT info about failures or passes and milage etc is all there. At first I thought it was a bit of invasion of privacy that your next door neighbour can tell you that your car failed it’s MOT for whatever reason etc. But it was introduced to reduce fraud. So now when you go to look at a car you can check previous history or if the milage is correct and if the car had any advisories that may cost you money before the next MOT. Passes the time when you are sitting in a car park waiting on somebody lol"

"I have just received an email from an Audi dealer featuring deals on new Audis. Interestingly they are offering £3500 off stock s/line Q5's.Personally I think this is a good deal, though I sure others will say they have got more off already."
It's not bad but yes can be better - drive the deal seem to be offering 10% off and have done so for some time.Personally find it strange that a strong seller like the Q5 is attracting 'big' discounts.Personally would much prefer them to not set the false higher price to discount and just have an open and honest clear policy.But then I know us customers wouldn't feel like we are getting a good deal ????
"I'm no accountant but IMHO it does seem a bit daft discounting a model which hovers right around the £40K threshold by 10%, they'd make more money reducing the OTR price by £4K and letting folks spend that on the extras they really want, they'd actually get £40K then instead of 36 - or am I missing something?"
And we would get the normal tax cost not the silly £400 one
"Totally agree with you, thankfully I purchased a stock vehicle in March before the new VED rates applied (though my vehicle was approx £80 below the £40k). In principle I would not pay more than £40k now for a vehicle because of these additional charges. We are all paying a massive amount in VAT to start with.My problem will be replacing my wife's TT Roadster next year as the minimum spec I would want is over £40k. If manufacturers offered lower prices as said we could spec up our vehicles and still be below the £40k. To me it is a no brainer and would save all the hassle on haggling too."

"I appreciate that everyone's view point will vary. I have no problem paying my fair of tax, but when you consider the amount of Vat paid, standard ved then add on an extra £1200 over four years in my opinion it is really taking is taking the p*ss.

"Just as a data point, I have a 2015 Q5 3.0 TDI with a ""meager"" 240 HP (and 428 lb-ft of torque). With 0-62 MPH times under 6.5 seconds, I find it mighty quick. It also excels at uphill highway passing. Baby it, and you get very respectable fuel economy around 5.0 L/100 km (=47 US MPG = 56.5 IMP MPG).I'm no longer caught up in the numbers game."
Not sure what you call a decent spec - my SQ5 petrol was significantly below that (and has HUD)
"Yep, about 8% I think - it was a car in stock in the country, and with the dealer group - so that helped....I think my car specs at about 56 or 57 - it has 21s, pan roof, the fancy lights, b&o, flat bottomed wheel, and a couple of other bits..."

"If the car has sat nav, drive select can be added in a minute or two using vcds."
Thanks Moss2000
"@ Moss2000does activating drive select do anything?i have bought a used 09 Q5 2.0 tdi without drive select, just activating it in vcds wont do anything i assume cause the hardware is not installed?"
ADS works perfectly for me after activation by VCDS.
"does it actually change anything? i have read it does hold higher revs in gear for the gear box, but since we dont have the hardware for the steering or springs those wont do anything?"
"It allows owner to set individual options to suit his preferences. Dynamic engine mode is the setting I prefer to use, makes the car more responsive. I prefer steering as standard. I prefer noise as standard.As you suggest, it does nothing for the ride."
allright. cheers for the reply. will ask someone to activate it when i get hold of vcds.
"Just something to add: After I took delivery of my 2015 Q5, I discovered that the Individual Mode in Audi Drive Select is only available as part of the Navigation package. Without the Nav system, you get a much more primitive MMI (Man-Machine Interface), which excludes the Individual mode, even as a VCDS option. There are a number of non-Nav features bundled into the Nav system. Audi doesn't tell you that."
"On 2017 Q5, has anyone noticed when you unlock the car, sometimes the bumper indicator lights flash, and sometimes the boot lid indicator lights flash, but never both?At night, the corresponding rear red lights come on - ie if the bumper indicator lights flash, the bumper red lights come on; if the boot lid indicator lights flash the boot lid red lights come on.Doesn't seem to be any pattern, seems to be completely random."

Black circles are often goodATS are good for fitting and can fill with Nitrogen
ditto on ATS
"My original tyres (front) are about done at only 15000 miles, which seems low compared to most on here."
"Skidz in Falkirk have a good reputation for price and not marking your wheels,not used them personally but they did my mates mustang at a good price and not a mark on his chrome alloys.I take mine to a wheel refurbisher as their tyre fitting machines are normally best of kit as they wouldnt refurbish wheels and mark them fitting tyres back on would they? And if they did then they could fix it i suppose.Camskill prices are normally best for mail order."
"Think my p zeros lasted 20k on front and 25k on rears,people are quoting a lot less miles than this but maybe they overestimate the sq's handling and throw it round corners."
"I ruined a pair of Dunlops in less than 10k! I guess I'm heavy on the go pedal or something.... I'm on Michellins now on the front which seem ok, they were on the rear initially and I really didn't like how they were driving, so swapped front and back round. I'm not sure if they just took some time to bed in or if it was having more grip on the rear than the front that felt odd. I think I like the Dunlops more but I'm sure I read somewhere that they don't have as much tread as others to start with.National Tyres every time for me, but Asda sometimes have good deals on."
"Thanks I have ordered from them before and couldn't remember the name. Although I had issues with 1 particular tyre from them on last car that might have been from new or just developed (although I can't remember now exactly what the issue was). Anyway so a tiny bit suspicious about where they source their stock from.Also which has best wear rate? Some on here used to say Dunlops, then someone said Dunlops were rubbish Pirellis were better. I've Continentals before on last car, and they were great tyres with very strong sidewall (felt like being on rails around corners) but wasn't impressed with the wear rate."
Have a look on Black Circle. Various brands listed therehttp://www.blackcircles.com/order/tyres/search
"I'd second Black circles, have been using them for a number of years and always use the same local fitter"
I just bought four 255/40/21 conti sport ckntact 5s with delivery miles for £200. Didnt fancy paying another £800 for some stickers on them!
From?
Whats the acceptable tread depth difference in mm between front and rear axle with quattro??
"In the manual it says something like ""avoid using tyres with varying tread depths"" - useful get out clause for Audi??"
I think its 3mm does that sound about right?
Don't know TBH but you'll want to keep them as close as possible or it's going to work the centre diff unnecessarily. My A4 is a quattro so it's always 4 new for it. The Golf gets 2 when and if.
I can get more 255/40/21 conti sport contact 5 conti seals with 6mm at £100 a corner

"That's cheap, could probably get over my conti aversion at that price."
I would probably switch fronts to back then change all 4 at the same time. I was stung before buying part worns and on a car like the SQ I wouldnt even consider it! For the sake of a half price tyre is it worth the risk?
Lug nut torque for Q5/SQ5: 140 Nm
Just had 4 P Zero's fitted at Kwik Fit for £900. That was price matching black circles best. Still not happy with 15k out of a set tho.
"Oponeo doing 21"" Dunlops for £202, cheapest I've seen them for a while."
According to my tyre dealer the prices can fluctuate like the stock market. I managed to get a full set of p zeros supplied and fitted for £830 in May (inc. Nitrogen fill) but I'm not surprised the prices have gone up now. The only comfort is that they seem to be wearing better than the ones on the car from new.
"Have you tried your local dealer. Had 4 x Pirelli Scorpions M and S fitted on my Q5 this time last year to replace the original Bridgestone duellers as I didn't fancy getting stuck up an Alp with High performance summer tyres that should be on an A7!! Nottingham Audi supplied and fitted them for the same price as lowest internet supply only. Took in a printed copy of the internet price and they better than matched it. Excellent service. Just a point, having had many 4x4s over the years, including several Land Rovers, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Volvo XC90 etc this is the first SUV fitted with summer sport tyres, not at least M and S!Take care, Fatlad"
"Maybe luckily, 21"" tyres suitable for the SQ are few, and pretty much all are top quality tyres with no real budget options out there, so all available makes should provide a quality rubber. Biggest disappointment with the original rubber has been wear, as 15k isn't really very good on a car that has been driven pretty conservatively. An occasional blast mostly in a straight line should have guaranteed closer to 20k and many get way more than this. Luckily on the miles I do it's still only a set every 2 years."
How many mm of tread does everyone here go down to before changing tyres? UK minimum limit being 1.6mm.
"I replaced my very soft but grippy pirelli`s with Michelin Latitude sport three, the only 21 inch tyres around that are ""A"" rated in the wet, they live up to their rating.Bought from back circles in Aberdeen, the wheels went in unmarked and returned unmarked, they even washed the wheels as well, great service.only gripe i have with the michelins is the fact that they have no rim protection, but possibly wide enough not to need it."
The 24 thousand dollar question - how much and where from?
"That equals the cheapest I've seen them, about 6 months ago. Up to £190 now but still a decent price."
They seem to fluctuate a lot. That is why I grabbed them. Next day they were £215 each.
"41k! Wow. If you get that from the Dunlopâs too then thereâs something seriously wrong with my driving style! Mind you, looking at youâre fuelly stats, Iâm thinking we might have very different ways of driving our cars! í ½í¸"
What are you guys paying for air on service Audi want £80.00 said it was a special gas.?
Special gas. Save your cash & go to specialist.Last time I paid £55 for a regas.Rappy.
Hi guys - my neighbour got a clean and re gas from Halfords for around £40. Not sure exactly what's involved but as rapport25 says - take it to somebody who is doing this regularly.
I have never found the need to have mine serviced.
Audi did mine for £49.
"Firstly some manners!!Hi all! I'm looking to purchase my first Q5! Just sold my A5 after 3 years and looking out for a 2009/2010 model Q5, still debating whether to go for a 2.0 or a 3.0.I had the multitronic gearbox in the A5 with no problems however all the noise about the S tronic issues is concerning me, especially as it seems to span all the VAG models that use variants of the box and the age/mileage of the cars I'm looking at - 70k miles plus. I know the signs to walk away from, I viewed a 2.0 that had the juddering issue a couple of days ago.I don't particularly want to get a manual, but I'm trying to get an idea of whether the gearbox issue is a inevitable one that's gonna blow up in my face or whether its just that it's more publicised as people only mention issues and never when things are going well?Help!! What do people think?"
"Assuming it's the mechatronic issue you're referring to, my (personal) advice would be:If there's documented evidence that the replacement / remedial work has been undertaken, then you shouldn't have any greater worries than usual over buying a car of that age and mileage.Conversely, if there's no record of the unit having been replaced - simply walk away - as there's a strong probability of future problems with it.Cheers and good luck."
"Thanks, the car im looking at has had the mechatronic and clutch replaced in the last year by Audi which is good. I’m going to see it in the next few days so fingers crossed I should be able to post up a picture soon if all goes well!"
Hi looking to fit four new tyres to the car and at the moment have Bridgestone dueler fitted. Have a price of £199.99 from Kfit which Audi say they will beat. Anything else worth a try im being offered Michelin Latitude sport 3 these are £237 which I would not mind trying. Any thoughts. Thanks Roger.
Sorry forgot to say 255.45R20W
I've had the Michelins on since new and they seem fine (done about 26k on them and they are down to about 4mm all round) ...................
I have just been to my local Audi dealer today and noticed that they had some metal side runners with rubberised anti slip grips on display. They really looked smart and would be a great addition to the car. They were approx £1000 included fitting. I appreciate they are not cheap but really tempted! I wish I had taken a photograph for the forum.
"Justanhonestman said:Hi Skiman - yep they look good as well as having a hefty price. I can get in and out of my car no probs, but my partner really could do with a step up to get into the car easier. BUT ! the downside is, that when you don't need a step to get in and out, you tend to miss the step and get out as normal. When you do this, the back of your trousers/ jeans rub against the edge of the runner and if it's been raining or you have gone through mud, then the back of your trousers will have some of that gunk on them as you rub against the runner on leaving the car. I think it is Range Rover that have an option to have a step that comes out from under the side of the car when the door is opened and returns when the door is closed. Some people like the runners, some don't. I feel it makes the car look lower than it really is. I like the look but would suggest you try getting in and out ( especially out ) before making your decision. CheersClick to expand...You are right about the muck etc, forgot about this problem as I also had this problem with side runners on a land rover discovery many years ago! I have also seen the side runners as you have described on the Range Rover that retract during driving they really are brilliant but if memory serves me right they are over £2k"

Iâd love to see them on the new Q5.Iâve had them fitted on my Q7 and took some getting used to more from the bashing my shin on it í ½í¸However main reason for me was to make it easier for the little ones in getting in and out of the car and seems perfect.Also helpful to stand on and wash the roof of the car í ½í¸The Q5 I canât work out if it needs them for similar reasons or whether the car is actually a good height and therefore doesnât need them.@Â£1k fitted its a good price as arenât they something like Â£950 from factory?Click to expand...Yes They are running boards. I would mainly use them for washing the roof also. I appreciate that a Â£5.99 plastic step would also assist in washing the roof!
Ha yes it would but it becomes slippy ????
Hi guys - I remember reading that Audi didn't recommend fitting side boards if the car had a towbar and sunroof ??? Maybe somebody could explain the logic there. They may have overcome this advice with the new Q5.
"Yep, I wanted all 3 but the configurator said 'no', still not sure why. Think they were around £800 if ordered with the car, probably more from the parts dept."

"Typical Audi, ring up dealer and parts manager tells me Navarra Blue is not available to order as touch up even though paint code exists. Tells me it's a new colour. Ring another dealer, colour ordered in and received within a few days.Now I have the touch up pen and all good."

"I am looking at changing my W205 Mercedes C Class Estate for a 2014/15 3.0TDi Q5.The Merc is an AMG Line model and has a pretty firm ride, a bit too firm for my tastes.That said, I do like the odd bit of spirited driving so I do not want a car that wallows.Has anyone spent time in both an SE on 18"" wheels and an SLine on the usual 20"" rims?If so, what did you think of the ride/handling characteristics?I would be very grateful for any input before I start searching."
"Sport suspension and 20"" wheels are options. If comfort is your priority, I would suggest you avoid both. My old Q5 S Line which had 19"" and standard suspension was very comfortable.I would suggest you take a test drive on your favourite road."
"Good evening,My Q5 is 18 months old now and has only 11k on the clock. I have considered trading in the car as the Mrs wants a TTS however I've been shocked at valuations. I'm concerned more that the Government have caused a mass panic with reference to the 2040 plan to ban diesel and petrol cars. Not quite sure I agree how that will work. However, the media does love to scare! I'd be interested to know whether anyone has recently traded in or has had recent valuations to contradict my fear or support it.I've purposely not been driving my own Q5 to keep mileage low and hope I can reach positive equity at some stage.Be interested to know the forums thoughts.HB"
"Yep, little point paying for a depreciating asset that's not being used, drive it and enjoy it, worrying about what it might be worth in the future isn't going to change what you'll actually get."
"A few hundred pounds here and there due to milage and condition is all you will gain at a trade in. Shop around a few dealers if you are going to sell to get the best deal, but get out and enjoy your car while you have it."
"The main reason for looking at trade in values was due to riding a motorbike into London (Yes I'm brave) and the car is never used. I was quoted 28k which seemed very low and I was told that the dealer has too many Q5's and can't shift them on. In reference to positive equity, what I mean is generally speaking after 2 years the car should start to balance out in a 4 year agreement. I know i'm a bit premature to 2 years but just curious if anyone on the forum has recently PXed to get a rough idea of market value of them currently."
Hi. I recently pxd my 2014 Q5 64 plate @ 16000miles. Would have been coming up to 3 years this November. Bought a new Q5 sports 67 plate which I took delivery of this weekend. I managed to get 5k discount and the difference between my finance and the trade value of the car was 1k. So in total had 6k towards the new Q5. I remember that the trade value offered was 26k. I was hoping for more equity buy tbh rule of thumb is normally up to 2k. I remember when the sales guy was giving me a tutorial on the new tech he mentioned that my old Q5 just sold and that was within minutes of handing my old keys and v5c.
"Cheers Dermu, congrats on new car. Your PX value does make me think mine is unreasonable. I'll hold fire and see what happens."

"Release the brake pedal quickly and listen out for a tinny sound like a beer can, this seem to be prevalent on several cars."
Would be grateful if you could report back as waiting for my vehicle.
"100% agree about the brake pedal. With regards to the unbelievable wait for a factory order, there are loads of very low mileage new model Q5's for sale on autotrader and the Audi UK websites, I would seriously consider one of these rather than wait months for a factory order.Enjoy your test drive, personally love our new Q5 no regrets whatsoever."
"Agree with Skiman, surprised how many low mileage cars on the Audi site."
"Justanhonestman said:Yup -- from experience and waiting on a replacement brake servo being fitted. While out on your test drive bring your foot smartly off the brake pedal after braking and listen out for a tinny 'clang' noise. You will also experience a lag from the gearbox when you take off from a junction or try to enter a roundabout smartly in heavy traffic. It can be unerving at first as you seem to be going nowhere as traffic heads towards you as you creep out into their path. Once you learn to anticipate your move you learn to hit the gas pedal a little earlier than normal. As with any new car it's a learning curve, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a nice drive. Don't want to wait 9 months ? There are lots of low milage and well speced cars out there. The decision is all yours. It's a shame that the clanging brake pedal has spoiled some owners expectations of their new 'luxury' car. This problem should never have got past quality control considering the cars were checked at Mexico and apparently checkedd at Emden before delivery. Enjoy your test drive and make sure it's not a quick end of the road and back job. Enjoy-- I'm sure you will lolClick to expand...Part of Honest Johns review :There's no manual gearbox, instead all models come with the seven-speed S tronic automatic as standard. It provides fast but smooth shifts and while there's still some hesitation at low speeds - for example if you slow down for a roundabout but then ask it to accelerate -"

"4 works for me, ha ha, Enjoy your new Audi."
Well done 370 miles since picking car up yesterday and booked in to local clinic to have smile surgically removed from my face...Engine is infinitely more refined and quiet than the 2.0. Stop/ start instant. Reverse quicker to engage..Is as good on the curves as on the straight. Mpg 38.1 on the DIS over this distance which was mainly motorway 80/90 mph. And some hoofing to hear the exhaust..I love car. Simple. Well worth the change and 4 year wait. Now to sell my old one sadly...
"When I got my Q5 I have to admit I really wanted an SQ.. but just couldn't justify the increase in cost. Now that there are a few used ones appearing on autotrader I've started my search for SQ, but I'm really struggling finding one with a decent spec.They all look great on the outside but on the inside the specs can be very basic - is this generally the case? Perhaps due to the cost of the SQ when new, people just can't spec them highly.My Q5 is specced as per my signature, and I have not yet found a single used SQ with that spec. Maybe I'm just being too picky and just need to decide the few key features I really want... but I've gotten used to many of the toys in the Q5 and would miss them all!"

After removing the vent grille I think it´s a better idea to get a new one. It is broken and not so easy to repair.

I'd agree with this comment. The plastics towards the bottom of the car do get cheaper and i really was not a fan of what they have done with the door coverings. The leather has now been replaced with FAUX Suede/Alacantara regardless of what you order for the seat coverings. Simply cheapen the look of the car. Door closing sound wasn't a reassuring Audi cluck of old either. But i don't know if this was an issue with these two cars or again a design thing.
"Think if I was going to spend north of £60k on a performance petrol engined vehicle the sq5 would be way down the list,whereas at less than £50k my current sq5 is untouched by anything else on the market diesel powered meaning it looks like I will be keeping it in the meantime,glad I specced it up and took the 4th year warranty at purchase.Less power,torque,performance and increased fuel consumption plus an uninspiring design and colour choices means few tdi sq owners will be moving down to the new one I think."

"Thanks to Audi I got the opportunity to goto Germany for play with the new SQ5.I have to say it was great fun, huge jump up on the current model (I cant speak for lower models as i didn't drive them). Very rev free engine which made that car come alive and i was genuinely smiling and enjoying it.

Petrol is the way forward IMO just to address the balance ????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Not sure how that works. I'm sure on the road both would be equal in terms of performance with the petrol being more drivable, more fun (if you like to rev) and the MK2 being a few steps up in terms of place to sit/live.I would seriously urge you to drive one..."
"Certainly the new model SQ5 is not as distinguishable from a standard Q5, or not to the degree the BiTDi is, at least not from what I can see on configurator.. That is maybe intentional though, just a bit dissapointing."
For that sort of money a Macan GTS would be my preferred option.
"Problem with the Macan is useable size. For me, the Q5 just about does the job, I think I would regret going into a Macan, even though I really do like the Turbo's a lot."
"I may go I-pace next. Not enamoured enough by the new sq and don't want to buy a macan because of the ""extras tax"" that I've paid before when buying a Porsche in order to have a reasonable spec. Also, I just can't get on with the new road tax costs. As the current car is not yet 2, fortunately it's not a concern yet anywaySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Agree the Q5 family IS indeed a family SUV, but there are lots that differentiate the old SQ from the rest of it's clan. With the new model, the difference is far more subtle, and I appreciate many will like that 'wolf in sheeps clothing' effect. Just doesn't quite do it for me.I haven't yet driven one, but it looks to me like they have copied Merc cabin, and that is not a good thing. IMO of course,."
"S and RS is just a formula Audi use to ""add"" to a basic spec to and hasn't change forever.S is just chrome look mirrors, grey grill, bigger black brakes, unique wheels, grey valance 4 pipes at the back, full leather seats and sports suspension.Cabin - I'm sure some MK2 owners will comment, but its 4 or 5 steps up on the original.Great place to sit and the bigger higher screen makes so much sense when you use it."
"Wouldn't disagree about the cabin, mine is feeling distinctly aged now when I look at competitors, but despite the useability of the big screen, it looks STUPID!The points about what an 'S' and an 'RS' gets you is point in case. Without those little details the car is no different to the eye. Most sports versions of cars rely on wheels, exhaust and similar little details to differentiate them, I'm not expecting a big bonnet bulge and air intakes."
"But thats the same regardless if its a MK1 or 2 Q5, a TT or an A4,3,5 - always has been that way.Audi dont do different body panels for the versions in the range.Remember photos are flat, but the screen actually works really well - it's at the perfect height, it's of a size that it doesn't wipe out the windscreen or visibility while providing a great deal of info back to the driver. I have an R8 that only has the VC and this 2 screen solution is much better IMO. I really like it."
"I simply meant that the current (old) SQ is easily recognisable and has a more aggressive stance when compared to a standard car, from the 2D pics I don't see that in the new car.. But, clearly I haven't seen it in the flesh, so maybe I will like it when I do..... Time will tell."
If you have the VC in the new Q5 which is a must what's the point of the second screen?
You get more info on the centre screen. I would possible say what's the point of the VC with the centre screen.VC is a good toy and i nice to have.
"Been saying it for a while, but the haters just wanted to hate it due to some pre-conceived notion.It's definitely a step in the right direction and it's much nicer to drive and better performance too."
It has some issues compared to the old model but overall it's a much better car.
It's a real shame they got rid of the centre console that dents just by looking at it ????????

Mine sure does get 'dinked' easily.. I wished I had gone for an alternative trim..
Anyone think the hidden exhausts are a styling adaptation to get us prepared for the electric car era and not needing to see them at the back of a car?
"Strangely there is an aftermarket option for the Tesla, fake twin exhausts ....... go figure !!!https://evobsession....st-system-fail/https://www.ebay.com...3633/bn_1491026"
"The plastic to the lower end of the cabin are much cheaper and more plasticky... if theres such a word.lower trims around the dash, centre console, door. The doors are cheaped out too - fake leather and crappy alcantara inserts.But overall, it's a massive jump on the MK1 in everyway."
"less than £100 for a replacement, but around 2 hours of work to get access to replace it ... was thinking of doing mine which has two big dinks from dropping keys ... even though I have Advanced Key I now use the slot in the dash instead."
"It does seem flimsier than the aluminium trim in my old A4, have you considered wrapping it, some of the 3M carbon fibre sheets look very effective and would also make it a bit more robust, quite a common mod I believe."

Yes I have. Almost bought all the bits to give it a go but to be honest I've stopped noticing the dinks. I'm one of these people who feels more comfortable once the car has a scuff or two and then I can stop worrying.
So they are still fitting clanking brake pedals it seems. Not the news I wanted to hear.
"........sounds a bit like hitting an empty can of salsa, bit much for a 1.5 million Peso car!Cheers"
I was in the Audi showroom a few days ago and had a good look around the new SQ5. Far to expensive for what you get and some bad trim issues. The fake rear silencers are really bad up close also the rear brake calliper looks cheap. Rear side skirts sticks out when the door is open and you can see body work between the rear seats and the door trim.
x3
Seen new sq5 in dealers on saturday and was amazed how much smaller the brake disks were compared to old model?Had good look at it but cant say it looked anything special.
"Yes, petrol TFSI.Rappy"
"1hp more 200nm torque less and 0.3 seconds slower 0-62. As said above I'm happy with the ""old"" SQ5"
Plus less road tax and no stupid iPad afterthought screen
The old SQ5 may become a future classic? .................................... if I should live that long <LOL>
Sorry my bad it's 350 bhp so a little more than mk1 but it's still slower.Popped into Audi this morning to have a look and prefer the original SQ5.The fake exhausts look terrible!The SQ7 is more than likely to be my next choice over the SQ5
X2 James. But do I need 7 seats mmmmm.
"Must be something wrong with yours or maybe your driving,i have no problem getting mine into the low 5's from a standstill,even 5th gear got close when they tried it"
"I remember watching that, if I recall correctly they reckoned that with less fuel in the tank and proper technique it would have hit the quoted time."
I made 0 assertions around Audis stupid pricing model (which you see across the range 50+k for a crappy TT wtf!!)Drive a new Q5...
Glasgow Audi keep calling me wanting me to upgrade. The petrol engine combined with the god awful front grill and rear apron with dreadful plastic exhausts are not doing it for me. I specc'd up an S4 avant which looked good and is essentially the same engine. I'm just not sure I can jump from the current diesel to the petrol. I'll maybe give one a whirl to see how it compares though!I've been eyeing up a Macan too but I think it might suffer from old tech syndrome too. The one with all the tech just now is the RR Velar. It's a proper step up from most other things around.
"Just as an FYI, I used to drive a BMW 328 for ages. 2 years ago, I switched to my current ride, a 2015 Audi Q5 with 3.0 diesel engine. 0-62 mph in about 6.4 sec. That's quicker than my BMW sports car! Plus, the cost per mile is a lot cheaper, I get better MPG, and I have lots more space.Even though my Q5 is not an SQ5, it's plenty quick. It's in muscle car territory. So an SQ5 is obviously still quicker, still better handling, still faster on the top end. SQ drivers: Enjoy! Ya got nothin' to complain about ;-)"
Dogzyboy avoid the RR Velar like the plague. It's essentially an F Pace underneath and I've rejected two of those since last September.
Hey Steve. I used to have a RR Sport V8 supercharged 5.0 with 503bhp. That was a great car but the SQ5 outguns it easily. It's phenomenal. The thinking mans Macan! LOL
"It's frikkin expensive to start with so I would be expecting some serious quality for my cash. You're right though, it's an F-Pace underneath so I guess there's some downsides to that. Thanks for the heads up. í ½í±"

"SteveMcB said:Not naming names but what I find very amusing is that someone who apparently is no longer an SQ5, or any Q owner for that matter, although he/she or the wife did apparently drive one back in the day - but had absolutely nothing good to say about it ( why TF did you buy it in the first place????) has the time or inclination to keep coming back and trolling MK1 SQ5s???Think I'll maybe jump back on my Subaru forum after about 5 years and tell them what crap cars they're driving - actually, maybe not, I don't want them to accuse me of not having a life.PS would have loved to have seen the salesman's face when you were doing the 0-60s in the new 'slow' version, ""of course I'll work the stopwatch, those socks are a bit ripe though""PPS curious to know if the sports diff is worth having on the new one, obviously you'll have tested that to the limits as well,but I do seem to recall you thought it was a waste of time in the plus - having fully tested that one as well, which I thought was odd, you being so scathing of it before it was even released.Personally I wouldn't waste my time testing a car I wasn't interested in buying.Click to expand...Ive been on scoobynet since 2003, mainly had a track scoob, untill 5 years ago, was fun, Now my fun car is a 2014 SQ5 with revo remap, love it."

The dealer seemed to think it won't sell as well as the mk1 but that's just his opinion. Of course the new tech will help but after having a look at it in the flesh I do prefer mine. Ok I'm a few years when I'm ready to change maybe I'll look at it differently but only had mine 9 months.He did mention march delivery for a SQ5 if ordered now! That's a hell of a wait

I rejected two. They are still very much work in progress.My colleague has a new S4 so I've driven the Petrol and Diesel 'S' cars back to back and whilst the Petrol makes a lovely noise and is incredibly smooth it lacks the urgency of the BiTDi unless you wring its neck."
"+1 for the Jag, very unimpressed by the car generally. Looks ok externally from the front, everything else is.. crap! Just my opinion.I spent a considerable time in an S4, and have now placed an order. My experience was the opposite of yours tho. I found it much more eager than my SQ oddly. This isn't to 'dis the SQ, great car, just found the S4 freer revving, grippier and more urgent off the mark and handles better, as you'd expect with a lower COG. In any case, both superb cars just different characteristics."
"Lacks the urgency whilst still out performing the TDi...Maybe it's to do with ""where"" the power is in the rev range and that the diesel runs out of puff at 3500rpm?Jag, great option vs the Audi.Our next SUV will prob be a Jag rather than a german derivative. Just need a decent electric version,New TDI sales confirmed to be down over 20% now."
Really? Personally I wouldn't have the Jag at half price. Jus sayin

"Last week a guy was offered 60K trade in for a top of the 'range' RR. Apparently it cost 110K - 12 months ago!!!!!Yesterday was in a new Cayenne diesel S, 380bhp and 850NM or thereabouts. I drove it without exceeding the speed limit for about 80 miles, including B roads, motorway and right across Edinburgh during peak. Averaged 35mpg which I thought was pretty good. Felt quite pokey, handling was decent in sport plus, very nice interior and sounded good.Too big for my needs but if you're interested in that sector probably quite good value, especially when compared to a RR, start at about 67K, this one was probably nearer 80 though."
Driven back to back the Petrol just didn't feel as fast. I'm sure there's almost nothing in it in reality. I've never owned a diesel car until 9 months ago. The V6 in the F Pace is a rough old Ford unit with a really narrow power band. The VAG unit is leagues ahead.
Absolutely agree on these points.. Sometimes though the lure of advancement is too strong to resist.. I loved my old Mazda RX8 - Terrible in so many ways but deffo had the addictive nature..
Would love to try a 3.0 bitdi. Someone has mentioned it's velvety smooth.
I keep checking YouTube for a mk1 bitdi vs a mk2 tfsi I'd love to see either a track vs or just a straight line drag race!
My dad had a 2000 Integra Type-R ... that was a crazy machine ... but was docile under 5500 rpm until the VTEC did it's valve trickery and it screamed all the way to 8200 rpm! Like you said great fun but where do you get a chance to do this? Certainly not in South West London where I live!!
"Strange comment - might as well just get the 150bhp then, esp in the south west"
"Really, when was this?.I was down Audi yesterday, and talking to the service manager who said the complete opposite.That is why we are getting the RSQ5. In order of quickest..RSQ5SQ5 BiTDISQ5 TSIRappy."

ThanksSnowman.Canyou post any videos or links?. Would be interested to see/ read.But like all diesel owners know. It's the huge mid range shove of torque that really impresses.Roll on the new SQ5 diesel. I keep hearing mixed messages about the actual release date.Rappy.
Interesting......Head of Audi Motorsport states new car is faster than the old one and beats the official 0 - 60 time despite Audi issuing official figures which disagree.Trust him but not the sales or service manager who have nothing to gain by stating the older car is faster.Just my thoughts
"My first post so be gentle...I don't care about 0-60 times. I have just ordered a new SQ5 (a stock car so none of this waiting around - collect 2nd Sept) and I didn't buy it because it would do 60 in 5 secs. I wanted mid size SUV that was refined, reasonably fun, reasonably comfortable and sounded good. I have diesel cars for most of the last 25 years, due to the mileage I covered or other need. Now I don't do the miles and can suffer lower fuel consumption for a silky smooth engine.Horses for courses and all that - loved my A6 3.0 diesel from 2015 but not what I wanted now."

"Not that there seems to be much between them but, if true, this seems a very unusual marketing technique, can't figure out why they'd publish figures stating that the new model is slower than the old one when it's actually faster?"
I agree. And as we all know Audi figures are not that acurate. So even the BiTdi maybe quicker than the claimed figures.Rappy.
"Well maybe he just wasn't really trying (but looked like he was), or my remap made a big difference. But it happened multiple times, as traffic let him catch up each time."
Or maybe he didnt want to race on the public highway... and was making as much headway as those that were driving faster anyway?
Maybe he was just fantasasing about having exhausts?
Ha ha ha. Interesting video. Even Tiff said you could get close to the recorded figure.I'm guessing less fuel would of helped here and gave a more accurate figure.Rappy.
"So the new SQ5 is slower, less torque, and much less MPG in real time driving.ad a good look at one yesterday at an Audi dealership, afraid I wont be rushing out to buy one of these, s mentioned earlier, the fake exhausts are a big mistake from Audi, especially when compared to Porsche Macan at least it looks and sounds like a performance SUV.Maybe the RS version, if we ever see it, will have the signature twin oval exhausts as per the new RS5 and sound a little sportier than the current SQ5, but don't tink I can wait that long, so it will probably be a Macan for me."

I bought one of the new ones, fuel consumption doesnt really bother me but sound and refinement do. I looked at the Macan GTS but a bit too flash for me, way too expensive (despite the famed residuals, about £10k extra cash out over 4 years) and old tech inside - and too small (boot and back seat).The new SQ5 is perfect for me. I dont mind the chrome strip at the back - but then I bought a Golf GTi rather than an R as I couldnt stand the 4 big exhausts on the back of the R, way too ""look at me"" for me. Discrete, refined, fast enough and very comfortable are how I would describe the new car - which is just what I wanted..."

"i had the oil, filter etc done for £167 (they price matched a local dealer)i also think the 'inspection' thing is a load of rubbish (they charge something like £250)When i received mine back from the dealer after the oli change, they had completed an inspection anyway (told me outer,middle,inner tread depths on all tyres etc)"
I think I was around £350 for both the inspection and oil change parts of the service.
Any one around north London/ Hertfordshire sides that can recommend a good Audi main dealer for sq5 first service.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
£247 first inspections oil change oil filter and pollen filter. Free wash and vac @ Audi watford.
Tiny tip:Supply your own oil...around £6 per litre at Asda and others places v. circa £18 a litre at dealership.You'll need about 7-8 litres for a full oil change.See previous threadhere:http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/31497-own-oil/page__fromsearch__1
"My SQ5 was due an inspection service last month. My dealer quoted a price just shy of £470. I asked my local independent Audi specialist for a price. He said the oil didn't need changing (it was changed last year) and the price, using genuine Audi parts, including labour was £90 inc VAT. Needless to say where I took the car! He also rotated the wheels to even out the tyre wear for free. He's an Audi Master Technician who provides fantastic service. They even have access to Audi's service schedule database (they pay Audi a fee for this) to maintain the onlinecservice history."
Can you provide the name of Indy and location?
Just booked into Glasgow Audi (Lookers) @ £452 for first major service (inspection + oil change + complimentary wash and vac!)
thats crazy...my 1st service at 2yr old was £280...if it needs pads and discs get them done privately.
"I'm happy and did pay the Audi price - 4 years and 50K miles servicing with brakes on a £53K car has cost around me £1800.00, or 3%, my feeling is if you can't afford to pay the dealer prices, you shouldn't be running such a car. Surely people shouldn't be scrimping and saving on such costs to run the vehicle"
It isn't a case of scrimping and saving. It is a well known fact that dealers make most of their profits on servicing and not retail sales. I can happily afford to buy and run a SQ5 but am not prepared to fund the vast new showrooms and sales staff who from experience don't know one end of an Audi from another. Just my humble opinion on the matter and I'm sure there will be views to the contrary. I count myself very fortunate that I have access to an excellent award winning independent Audi garage who service the vehicle meticulously and don't issue advisories on things that are fine and don't need replacing.
sorry cant agree...dealers charge twice the labour charge of a decent indy garage and they will get similar quality parts for half the price of a main dealer...once done you wont know the difference but have plenty money left.

I am sure he means gearbox oil change?
No problem - We all live and learn.The Q5 has a torsion differential rather than Haldex. I can't remember ever seeing anyone report issues with the torsion diff.Although a bit of paranoia never hurts....
"Has anyone tried to fit a Macan space master spare wheel to a SQ5 ?When I bought my SQ5+ there were a few collapsible spare wheels about on eBay.

IMHO it would fit. You could correct the offset with a spacer.

"Justanhonestman said:Hi guys- tried to use the sat-nav with the google earth view the other day. A notice came up telling me my trial license had expired and to contact Audi. I had been reading on another forum where somebody with an A4 had contacted customer services about the miserly 3 month trial. He got an extra 12 months free added to his 'trial.So I went to Audi UK's website and a red 'live chat' window opened up on the right hand side of the page. Entered my question into the window asking why Audi only gave a 3month trial considering the cost of the car and saying that I thought it was a yearly trial that was included.The customer services rep asked what I thought of the car and went through a few questions as to why my sat - nav had stopped. I think he thought it was broken rather than an expired license. He asked for my reg number and then confirmed the model and colour etc related to my reg. He said he had driven the same model a few weeks ago and enjoyed it-- of course I agreedHe then asked if it was ok for him to give me a free 12 month extension onto my license which might take around 5 days to activate the system again. Of course I agreed again and thanked him for the kind gesture. So in this case I take back any doubts I had about Audi c/s and gave them 5 stars in the question at the end of the live talk.So if your license has expired recently, it might be worth a shot with their live chat or phone direct to the number he gave me - 0800699888.Be polite and say you didn't expect such a short trial considering the price of the car etc.According to some other forums, Audi were supposed to include a 12 month trial for UK cars without the tech pack. I understand the tech pack gives a 36 month trial.So - give it a go if your license has expired. Audi c/s are my best buds now lolClick to expand...Thank you for this advice, After reading your post yesterday I contacted Audi Customer services via live chat. They said they would give me 12 months connectivity free this was activated earlier today - working great. Top tip thank you justahonestman, very much appreciated."

It may be worth contacting Audi cs and say that you were disappointed to hear that non tech paying customers have had there free connectivity extended - they may extend yours to four years.
"Hi guys-- thanks for the feedback. I don't know if this is just a kind gesture from Audi to keep customers who complain sweet, or if we really should have had 12 months from new. They may just be waiting to see how many complain but say nothing to those that pay for an extension. I still haven't been updated but the guy said it could take 5 days to activate. I originally contacted them through e-mail and they were supposed to reply within two days. After a week I gave up waiting on them replying and tried the live chat. So it seems live chat or the telephone is the way to go with c/s from now on. Cheers guys."
Without the tech pack it's a 3month trial.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
My view is the free extended connectivity is part compensation for the free clanging brake pedal trial also provided by Audi.
Gutted I've been missed out of that trial......Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
I think that the free clanging brake pedal was mistakenly left out of the options list in the configurator. It should have been listed as an audible alarm to tell you that the brakes are now not active -- they could have got another £100 out of us for that option lol.
That's me been activated again -- result.
U.K. With tech get 3 years off the bat
"That sounds expensive, my service was much less........ £284 I think.Audi do a price match, get a quote from your nearest back street garage."
At 38000 miles it needs the gearbox oil and filer change also around £170 mark
For price match use servicing stop - they are doing 50% off at the moment. I don't have an SQ5 but my quote was £155 for a major service.
The SQ does not need the gearbox oil changed apparently but the last quote was £750 as the Pana roof needs a service and some grease at a cost of £165 lol
got ti for £560 in the end not sure if thats good or bad
Was that at D.Turpin Motor Co. IMHO you were ripped off.
Agreed.
"Its booked with Audi for the end of the month what price should i be paying ?its the 2nd service and oil service at 40k ? long life,fuel filter , pollen filter, ect all the things required at 2 years 40 kthat was the best quote i had from 3 stealers ?"
This is the second service i got the first one for £250 with oil
"So you got a good price for the first, why so much for 2nd? Only additional item might be the fuel filter, anything else? How much do they cost?"
fuel and pollen defo not sure of the rest but i will check
"I'm not sure about the new Q5 but my A6 pollen filters are reasonably easy to change. Just remove a few easily access self tapping cross head screws securing the glove box and lower it onto the floor of the passenger footwell. This gives access to a small door secured by a spring clip, open the door and pull out the filters. They are readily available online, I paid about £16 for my last pair."
"What do you mean by ""my car needs a""? Is that a website or?"
"Yep, it is a comparison/quote website: you can find it here -https://mycarneedsa.com/"
"I've now had two reminders about having this service action for my Q5, I'm still undecided whether to have this done. I know this has been discussed on here before but after watching Watchdog over the last two weeks it appears that some people are experiencing problems with their update.So my question is has anyone on here with a Q5 2.0 tdi who have had this update had any problems, or are there any like me who do not want to have it done as I like the way the car runs and are of the opinion that if its not broken why fix it.Dibs"
I've had 2 reminders and a phone call from the audi to have the car booked in for the fix. The most recent letter says that they can arrange for the Audi mobile recognition team to carry out the fix at an address of my convenience. Basically I've read too much negative regarding the fix. Im Therefore not having it done. Anyways there is no legal requirement to have the works done. I don't think that by not having it done will impact the cars value.
"I've had the same letter re. home visit. The problem I now have is my car needs a service and I'm afraid they will do the upgrade without my permission, I've phoned customer services and asked if I can have written confirmation that I've not had this fix done but they have said that they will only make a record on my service record that it has not been completed. So now I have to make up my mind whether to keep my Audi service record or go to a non franchised dealer."
"I had my Tiguan R Line ""fixed"" and the car was completely different. The car seemed to hold back until much higher rpm. It also sounded like a bag of spanners so no don't get the ""fix"" done. Enjoy the car as it is. When you come to trade in they will do the update anyway"
"I too would be concerned that they may do the fix without your authorisation. Perhaps you could give dealer a written instruction: I do not want the ""fix""."
"I do not believe there is a ""fix"" for SQ5?"
I declined the 'fix' when my car went in for a recent MOT. I was asked to sign a fix rejection form basically saying they had offered and I have declined.There is no legal obligation to take the fix - i checked.I'm a firm believer in if it isn't broken don't fix it.....
"In that case I would have to get a solicitor involved, have you thought of getting to press involved ? Who do these people think they are."
From a friend >..... after I had the dieselgate update done to my Q5 the EGR valve failed.I contacted Audi about any customer warranty as VW were offering this and was told no and quoted over £900 for the repair.I then contacted Marc Clubb at North East Motors and he quoted a far more reasonable £614.12. So the car went in and the repair was completed.About 2 weeks ago a letter came thru my door from Audi telling me the were now offering warranty work on the EGR on all cars with the update. So I was straight on the phone to them and was advised to send all my paperwork to them for review.Well yesterday I got a call from Audi saying a cheque was coming my way for £614.12!������������������������������������Could not have been better news in this current time. Just chuffed.������������Click to expand...
A month or so back my sister's A3 packed in a week after the update ( she didn't know they had done it). EGR had failed along with some unspecified exhaust fault ( I'm guessing DPF) but surprisingly it was fixed without argument and she was also given a courtesy car.The guy at Audi more or less admitted that they know the 'fix' is causing problems. I don't think it's a coincidence that VW have stopped hounding me to get my Golf done.
"You are a brave man, I look forward to your observations.Dibs"
Indeed as do I... 15 mile drive from garage showed no difference so will see....Never been described as brave before so quite chuffed... Lol...
I wouldn't bother driving back for the car cleaning kit!!
"Just as a follow up to this, after driving 700 miles since emmisions fix and other upgrade stuff etc am glad to report absolutely no issues. Car runs smooth and no glitches.Maybe I'm lucky or needs more miles but at the moment no complaints.."
I see some people are displaying their Fuelly mpg in their signature. Please could somebody advise how to do that.Many thanks
"Create a Fuelly account.The fuelly web page provides you with HTML code that you use to insert in other websites, possibly as your signature. You have various options you can display (e.g., big, small, with icon or without) as well as displaying your fuel economy using various metrics like L/100k, US MPG, Imp MPG..In the MyAudiQ5 menu bar where you see your name, click it -> My Settings -> Edit Signature tab. This is where you create your signature."
Thanks.It's item 2. I was having problems with - currently still am judging what I can see from my first attempt.Based on my current figures after four fill-ups I am afraid you may need to change your signature line
"Ransman, it took me several attempts and experimentation to get it right."
"You click on the ""Badges"" link underneath the log book section."
Nearly three weeks since the last fill-up so back to more normal driving. Still managed a true 48.4mpg. The fuel computer seems to be averaging around 3% optimistic.
"Ransman: I've updated my signature. Is your 50.9 (Imp) MPG from highway-only driving, or a mix?"
Interestingly my best individual result of 55.6mpg included that two hour queue to get out of the car park but it was followed by a 280 mile drive the next day.
"Ransman, please come back and visit this thread periodically and let us know your MPG for your next few tanks. I'm impressed by the apparent jump in fuel economy, It's significantly better than the posted North American EPA numbers."
Wilco. I suspect it will suffer a bit as we move into the colder weather but it is far better than I thought it would be.Just have to get some little niggles sorted and I will be thoroughly pleased with the new motor.
"Ransman, Which engine do you have? For comparison, my 2015 has a 3.0L V6 TDI, the only diesel that was available in Canada. I would have got the 2.0L TDI if it had been available. The numbers you're seeing are similar to my pure-highway fuel economy while I hypermile (~54 Imp MPG)."
2.0 Tdi - it's in my signature. I suspect that you would beat my numbers easily as the traffic around Bristol can be horrendous although I try to avoid it at peak times whenever possible.
Ransman - those figures are impressive
What are you getting?
Unfortunately mine are mostly short trips. Best so far was 51 mpg on a 22 mile run. Only 1100 miles done. Will be driving over 100 miles this weekend. I am assuming that figures were with AC off.
"Not always, although the 65.4mpg trip it was."
What speed were you driving to get that?
I see some people are displaying their Fuelly mpg in their signature. Please could somebody advise how to do that.Many thanks
"It was ideal conditions: 50 mph, no A/C required, ambient temps in the around 70'F (so oils, lubes, joints, bearings not stiffened up). I believe 50 MPH (1,200 RPM in 8th gear) is the fuel efficiency sweet spot for my engine."
"I guess we are in danger of repeating an earlier thread but, in the UK, HGV's can travel at 56mph so anything slower is acting as a rolling road block which potentially causes lots of problems on a busy motorway. That's why I do not go below 60mph, and will speed up if I see I am slowing things down behind me.Maybe there is less traffic on your highways but 50mph can catch some people out who are approaching from behind."
"As you can tell from my ""location"" below my profile silhouette, I live in North America. Here, multi-lane highways are common, and minimum speeds are posted (they're typically 45 MPH when not posted). And of course, when I'm on a road where passing is not possible or practical, I make sure I'm not a rolling road-block."
"Pleased to hear that - it just wouldn't work over here. When you say multi-lane highways, how many lanes are you talking about?"
"At least 2 lanes in each direction. Around major cities like Toronto, there are areas where you'll have 6 lanes across, in the same direction (not including on and off ramps or merge lanes)."
"Well most of our motorways have three lanes, sometimes four. It was the three lane ones I was referring to so can't see how you wouldn't be holding people up at 50mph on two lanes unless it was very quiet. Are trucks limited to a particular speed?I have driven around Toronto around 40 years ago and, IIRC, there are sections with eight lanes which are split three and five such that you have to filter to the outer lanes when you want to turn off but you quickly get used to it."
Nice to see some other good consumption figures.Incidentally I do not have the graphic you have in the middle of the left hand dial but I have it on a separate screen.
So that's what happened to justanhonestman's Q ????
"Lol - exactly what I was thinking. A little bit of twin- stick here and there, and a good polish. He will never know lol. Now I know why my sound deadening felt was laying in a heap in the boot. My locking wheel nut removal bolt and nut cover removal tool will be lying in the ditch there along with the missing plastic clips that should have held my hoses and cables in place, not to mention the broken light in the kickplate. Mmmmmmmm it's all beginning to make sense now lol"
Ah bugger....wonder where our one is - hopefully wasn't on the back of that lorry...for once I hope the tracker was right in saying it left the factory last week assuming the pic is like today
Hi Nemo-- look on the bright side-- your's may be the one that is still strapped to the lorry above the cab. Hasn't touched the ground - yet ! Lol. Just shows how well those cars are strapped down for transport though.

"That will buff out, bit of paint.. normal transport damage.."
"The Audi warranty on my 2014 Q5 S Line Plus expires soon and I am trying to decide on whether or not to buy an extended warranty. Although I might still be open to persuasion, I think I have already ruled out the Audi own version as it looks quite cheap at first glance but the annual charge starts to rise steeply after the first year and does NOT include any breakdown cover. That leaves my Audi dealer (Inchcape) selling their own version which is provided by Car Care Plan - they will sell a 3 year policy for under £1100 which seems a lot but, like any insurance, might start looking quite cheap if a claim needs to be paid out on an expensive component - it also includes breakdown cover.Has anybody had any experience (either positive or negative) of extended warranty policies in general and the Inchcape / Car Care Plan one in particular?Any early views would be much appreciated as I need to make a decision by the end of this week."
"Got the RAC platinum included with my old A4 cabby when I bought it. I kept it going for about £200 per annum, had a couple of claims, a headlight washer unit, reversing sensors and a servotronic module, they stumped up without any issues.Break down cover would be extra."
"Steve, Thanks for that but I just had a quick look at the RAC website and it look like you can only get their warranty with a car from one of their 'approved dealers'."
"Hey all, I have a Canadian Audi SQ5 2015. When I purchased it I got almost every warranty available including the aftercare appearance package with tire and rim.Someone was driving in front of my wife the other day and smoked the curb, of which a piece broke off and she ran over it. Both passenger side tires have bulges in them but are not leaking.Has anyone used the tire warranty and have any idea if Audi will cover a bulge. There wording in the contract is very vague but leans more towards tire leakage."
"Hi JEvMar-- I didn't take the tyre and wheel protection package when I bought my car. But the salesman went through what it covered with me. From what I remember it covered any puncture repairs and/or damage that required the tyre or wheel to be replaced or repaired. The way the salesman put it over, you were covered just about for anything that happened to your tyres or wheels with a limit on the number of claims you could make within the warranty period. Maybe some other members here have taken out the protection package and could be more specific of what it covers. I take it the UK warranty should be the same as the Canadian one. I would be very wary driving around with bulges in my tyres though. Best of luck."
Thanks for the input. Yeah I'm trying not to drive it but not easy with kids always needing to be everywhere
It comes in 3 stages 1st is the chime which I've had a good fewTimes 2nd is the wheel judder as a reminder then 3rd is full blown emergency stop. I've had the chime and wheel judder when someone has shot across my path joining a motorway but never had it anchor up before.I think there's a lot of variables with the technology and what makes it anchor.

I have had the brakes slam on a couple of times for no apparent reason. I did have the ACC engaged at the time so not sure which system gives the false positives.
I had the rear brake slammed when someone tried to cross the car when reversing
"Hi guys-- just out of curiosity. When the full anchor is activated, is there any indication on the dash showing which side of the car activated the system ? I was too busy looking around with eyes like saucers trying to see what I had hit lol. I thought the Pre Sense City only activated from the beam facing forward at the front of the car behind the rear view mirror. Is the system which activates the brakes when something or somebody is behind the car, linked into the tech pack with the parking aid? I don't have the tech pack and get the normal bleep that increases as you get closer to the car behind when reversing. It changes to constant sound when about a foot from the car behind but doesn't slam the brakes on."
It is part of Pre sense rear and side assist pack.

"Hi guys - yep I'm happy with the milage I'm getting too. Regular 35-38 mpg depending on the areas I'm in. With careful use of the pedal and lifting off to induce coast mode, you can increase your milage. I prefer to keep a record of my fill ups and compare my milage that way, which gives a more accurate figure. But it's fun to see how high you can get that average figure by careful use of the throttle. I've managed over 44 but the photo my partner took is out of focus. I' going to try and upload another photo taken just before I went over the 44."
"Had65mpgshowing along the M4 on Monday just as I reached the M25 from Bristol. Unsurprisingly it then dropped as I was travelling around the M25 but I was still showing 57mpg average after 260 miles, including the return journey back to Bristol. OK, I was driving like Miss Daisey but I was not in a hurry. The long term average is now down around the 50mpg mark after around 450 miles which includes some slow journeys around Bristol. Now awaiting filling up to work out the (in)accuracy of the FC.I am planning a road trip next week so will have more data to share soon"
"My motor (TDI) has done approx 2500m since new, long term average showing 47.6 though more recent journeys on B roads now seem to be averaging 54-57 mpg."
No doubting the better MPG from the diesel but my journey types don't work with a Diesel engine. I guess this is the main reason people get the petrol over the diesel.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Have you calibrated your fuel computer?
It's a valid reason
"I've been using the Efficiency mode recently and get about 5-10% better mileage than with Comfort; 42 mpg on a motorway trip. Efficiency seems to be a bit less soft and smooth than Comfort, but still comfortable.Does anyone know what changes the different settings make to things? - there isn't much info in the handbook."
Hi JP Oxfordshire- the only difference I have picked up on so far is that in Efficiency mode the gears change at lower revs as you progress. In this mode I usually reach gear 7 at around 50-52 mph. In Dynamic mode the gears change at higher rev levels which give you better acceleration by staying in lower gears for longer- but uses more fuel. Not sure how the suspension is adjusted between modes in non air suspension models though. Seems the steering tightens up in dynamic mode too requiring less input providing sharper steering compared to efficiency.
"Must admit I just leave it in 'individual' (everything except gearbox in dynamic) but I'm sure I read that economy/efficiency does something to the aircon as well. Guessing it cycles the compressor out more often so in theory should improve consumption.When we first got the car my wife drove us 40 miles in 'economy' I drove back in 'dynamic', according to the DIS the difference in consumption was next to nothing.Admittedly that was mainly motorway/A class roads and the engine will also have loosened off a bit so things could be different now."
Those figures are good for petrol better than my old 1.6 qashqai manual.I have done only 700 miles and mostly town driving. Will keep an eye on dpf. Best figure is just under 47 mpg for a 20 mile run between 60-70mph. I know it's not even been in period but not expecting any higher figures.
No
"Sorry if this is sort of hijacking the TFSi thread, but it is about fuel consumption after all and the differences with the diesel make an interesting comparison.I couldn't stand the suspense any longer and just filled up to the same point as last time. The car has just under 800 miles on the clock. After 436 miles she took 41 litres, which works out at 48.3mpg and this compares to the OBC showing 50.1mpg so it's only 3.5% out which is less than I have had on some previous Q5's. Pretty good so far!"
"Pretty good, although mpg is important, for me it is the characteristics of the Diesel engine I like e.g. Low down torque etc. My wife's latest TT roadster is petrol, far preferred her previous two diesel versions. If I said this on the TT forum I would be shot down in flames."
I haven't driven a petrol Q5 so it would be interesting to see how it compares some time. For a number of years the diesel decision for me was primarily down to lower depreciation but that may well change in the future. I don't think that we are there yet though.
"Thanks for the different figures, it's good to see the comparisons. To be honest I only bought the petrol due to my lack of mileage and wanting the extra performance. I'll be happy with high 30's on a long run.Sent from my SM-G930F using Tapatalk"

Best I have seen is 65mpg after 100 miles. I do, however, expect the average to drop off a bit as I get back to more normal driving."
Sorry to hijack the thread as well but I recently bought an 8 month old 340ps SQ5 Plus SE for £45k. Has every single extra. Immaculate. Stuck my private plate on it. I'm getting 31.6mpg average (real calculated compared to 34mpg shown on the computer) across a mix of urban and A road driving plus occasional motorway and it will do 0-62 in under 5 seconds. I'm not even trying to be fuel efficient and I'm stunned. This has to be the bargain of the century. I don't understand why everyone isn't driving one!
As they are £45k not a £39k pcp deal. Wouldn't want an old model either lol. Lovely car tho and glad you're enjoying it.Sent from my SM-G930F using Tapatalk
"People seem to be mentioning ""quality issues"" with the new model Q5, what are they? One poster on the forum states that a couple have been returned due to quality issues is this really the case?Are the delays from Mexico/Elden really down to these ""quality issues"". My new Q5 has only had one minor issue, less than my previous Audis, perhaps I have just been lucky.Personally my new Q5 has more than lived up to expectations, though there is still time for future issues to develop I guess.Clearly there appears to be lengthy delays which really is not acceptable. I just wish the reasons were known."
"Skiman, Nemo well said, my mind is also running on overtime. When I eventually get my car hopefully everything will be fine but Audi need to get their act together it the not knowing that the problem. I complained to Audi and a case was raised, they rung back but they have no answers on delivery times, they advised my dealer has direct access the systems, guess what spoke to them and the only info they have is the build week! but they did confirm deal is set in stone and Px price is guaranteed so will keep on driving the Q3 till then, peeved off though as have had 2 punctures this week in same tyre and because they close have got to buy a new tyre and because its a Quattro have to change the other tyre on the axle as well, anyway its only money and you can't take it with you !"
"Nemo said:It was me who posted re a couple of cars being returned as I was told via my dealers...Wouldn't worry too much about that as there's always some cars which will have some problems and people will do one of two things...Return in the first 30days as per consumer law ORAllow the dealer to fix...The issues could be as simple as the clanging break pedal?The only way we will know what issues are occurring with the cars is by others on the forum mentioning them - helps us build a database (never mind Audi) like one of our forum members noticing they didn't have a locking wheel nut key, now not a big issue on collection but a huge issue the day you need it.Quality issues won't be unique to the Q5 it happens across all models and manufacturers (not that they'll ever admit it)The delays look to be (and in Reading between the lines here)Mexico is a new factory and therefore Germany are double checking the cars when they get across.Q5s have always been good selling cars (I remember when we looked at getting one a couple of years back and it was a 6-7 month wait for the SQ5) therefore I presume the 9 months is due to double checks - backlog of cars from Mexico coming in to Germany to next destination.I wouldn't worry too much (the worry is due to all our minds playing overtime working out what's wrong) and remember most people won't be bothered about a small rattle etc etc.My advice...enjoy the cars and enjoy the prolonged exclusivity and admiring looks from us all staring....âºï¸í ½í±í ¼í¿¼Click to expand...Well said, 100% agree."

I feel after looking at the F-Pace, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Evoque etc that I have made the right choice and have enjoyed every drive since I finally received my car.I don't think anybody recently has had major quality issues that stopped them using their car either.I think when little niggles or issues are found, the sense of disappointment is increased because of the experience a lot of us went through with dealers and Audi customer services giving conflicting reasons as to why our cars had not arrived.It didn't help when after being told by the dealers that the delays were due to extra quality checks being carried out, then still finding faults or niggles when you got your car.Did nobody look inside the two opening side pockets in my boot to notice the insulating material laying in a heap on top of the fuses ? Remember - this is a luxury SUV from a major manufacturer costing £40000 plus. I cannot see any means to keep this material in place like sticky pads or velcro etc. Repositioned it myself and hope it stays in place. My locking wheel nut release bolt and wheel nut cover removal tool were missing. Sure - not life threatening but could have stranded me somewhere when needed. Passengers door sill illuminating S-line kickplate not working- again not serious but bloody annoying that this was not picked up either which will require a return visit to the dealer. Then we come to the clanging brake pedal which seems to lack any damping as it returns to its normal position after being pressed. Did nobody hear this or want to hear the clanking ? And according to one member Audi are replacing the brake servo to stop the clanging which implies the brake pedal is not being damped on its return motion. Nobody heard this during the 'extra checks ' ?But we have to take into account that this is a new venture for Audi in Mexico. Thousands of people had to be trained. It all takes time and mistakes will be made till the factory is up and running proper with the workforce settled into their jobs.Most niggles or issues are minor and were missed by the new and unexperienced work force in Mexico. But should not have been missed at Germany.Hopefully delivery times will decrease as problem areas get ironed out . Is there lessons to be learned about ordering the first models in a new range ? Who knows- but I am enjoying my car and putting the delivery issues behind me. For those contemplating ordering and may be concerned by some of the posts in the forum - don't be. Most of the niggles were or are very minor and didn't stop us enjoying the car but were exasperated by the ordeal a lot of us went through when waiting on delivery.The only advice I could give is to agree a part exchange value on your car when ordering - and get it in writing and signed.

"Hi Skiman - thanks for the reply. It's little things like this that get my back up lol.

"I dread to think.My wife's new mk3 Audi TT Roadster, was quite noisey compared to our previous TTR's. On inspection I noticed that several areas in the boot had no or little insulation. I purchased on eBay some self adhesive 10ml automotive sound insulation it cost about a tenner. What a difference it has made. It is just a shame that I had to do this in a premium brand car. If it had been a cheap car then I would not have minded so much. Car manufacturers also seem to be boasting about how much lighter their cars are becoming. I guess this is at the expense of such things as decent sound insulation materials and reducing the quality of other components."

"Exactly, the German manufacturers have been trading on this perceived reputation for years.Look what happened to VW, ""premium German engineering"" and ""cheating"" are not two terms that generally go together."
"Nemo said:It was me who posted re a couple of cars being returned as I was told via my dealers...Wouldn't worry too much about that as there's always some cars which will have some problems and people will do one of two things...Return in the first 30days as per consumer law ORAllow the dealer to fix...The issues could be as simple as the clanging break pedal?Click to expand...Not sure I would describe this problem as 'simple', dealer has had my car for nearly two weeks and yet to find out if it's been resolved..."
Which begs the question is it the brake servo really? As that isn't a 2 week job unless the parts on back issue
"People seem to be mentioning ""quality issues"" with the new model Q5, what are they? One poster on the forum states that a couple have been returned due to quality issues is this really the case?Are the delays from Mexico/Elden really down to these ""quality issues"". My new Q5 has only had one minor issue, less than my previous Audis, perhaps I have just been lucky.Personally my new Q5 has more than lived up to expectations, though there is still time for future issues to develop I guess.Clearly there appears to be lengthy delays which really is not acceptable. I just wish the reasons were known."
"Justanhonestman said:Hi Nemo - it starts to get worrying when we hear more about this problem from other members. I am waiting on feedback from Audi as to what they are going to do with my noisy brake pedal. But even if the part was on back order, there is no reason to keep the car in the garage. Surely they wouldn't strip out a servo before the part had arrived. I think dealers will be in contact with Audi UK reporting this problem and waiting for answers from them as they themselves will be checking out that area on other cars. Is there a recall coming ? Audi will do their utmost to prevent another recall being announced so soon after the emissions hoo ha. Lets hope they find a fast fix with little disruption to customers. Hopefully this is only going to affect early cars. It could end up a costly excercise for Audi when you take into account the cost of these repairs and hire cars etc, not to mention the impact on Audi's already tarnished reputation. It's not spoiling me enjoying the car , but has taken the shine off the initial excitement of receiving my new car- when I eventually got it lol.Click to expand...It took over week to diagnose the problem and even then I think it was on advice from Audi UK. To be fair it is (hopefully was!) an intermittent problem so difficult to find. Ordering and fitting the part only took a couple days though they still have the car for testing. Promised the car for tomorrow afternoon."
"Hi geoff3, good to know and thanks for update.Mailed you asking for details if that is okay. I'm going in tomorrow however my dealer can't see anything on the system as of yet?!They've asked me to recreate it, no doubt it will drive perfectly tomorrow!"
"Got the car back yesterday after having the break servo replaced, only covered 20 miles but so far so good. The break pedal does seem to have a different feel to it (more damped and less play maybe?). It's early days so I'll post when i have covered a couple hundred miles which would be a more reasonable test bearing in mind the intermittent nature of the problem."
"Guess what! Yes The brake clanking has returned I guess replacing the brake servo was a bit of a shot in the dark.Seemed OK for a week or so then ""CLANK' when releasing the brake pedal.My new Q5 is back in the dealers workshop ..."
"Geoff3 Sorry to hear your brake pedal clank has returned, I hope you get a speedy resolution, please keep us informed (and praying my car does not have the same fault when it arrives)"
Sorry to hear this Geoff - really hope for you're sake and everyone else's they find the reason and fix quickly now to firstly get you back on the road and enjoying you're Q and secondly for any others like Jusanthonestman to get the fix reasonably quickly when car is in.Keep us informed ????????
"Hopefully Audi will come up with a fix, my Q5 still making the same clanking noise. Please keep us all posted of progress, thanks."
"I hope so too, it seems to be affecting a small proportion so, fingers crossed, yours will be fine. With a bit of luck the issue should be resolved by then anyway.BTW I have a short video of the problem (about 5 seconds) if anyone would like it ..."
Yes please. Can you post a Youtube link on here?
"Geoff, can you post the link to your video, I might need to show it to my dealer to explain the issue."
"Has anyone got anywhere with getting this issue solved? I have the same problem, car is booked in for later this month, my dealership doesn;t seem to have encountered the issue before"
"Mines been at the dealers for over 4 weeks, it's had 2 servo replacements but the issue still remains. The car has spent over a third of its life in repair. Very disappointed."
It's still there? Jeez feel for you - have you had any further updates or are they waiting to be told what to do next?
"I don't blame the dealer as they've been keeping me updated and are very apologetic about the whole thing, they're reliant on instructions from Audi technical, these haven't been forthcoming. The matter has been escalated to Audi UK Head Office (not customer services as they're just a waste of time). So I continue to wait..............patiently."
"I have mine booked in for a few weeks so will keep you all posted, not looking promising though...."
HelloJust looking to find someone that has had to have their Timing Cover Gasket replaced and what the cost was. Mine is in getting sorted now but they haven't come back with a price yet. I have been told off someone that the engine needs to come out and its a 24 hours for labour cost alone.Hope they are wrong.Any info welcomethanks
Did you not ask for an estimate?
"That's what they are doing now, sorting out a price. It hasn't gone to the stealers, its gone to a German car specialist garage. I've had work done off them before. I just wanted a bit of an idea if someone had already had this done. Maybe someone on here has had there timing chains replaced? or someone knows if the motor has to come out!"

"My 2013 2.0 Tdi Auto SLine Plus, had the software fix yesterday to reverse the cheat device at my local Audi centre.I have not been able to detect any decrease in performance or increase in fuel consumption as of yet. I was however informed by the service advisor, that I will probably notice an increase in the use of Adblue.To compensate me for that, the Adblue tank was topped up, and I was given 5 vouchers for the next 5 top ups which will be carried out for free.Anyone else had anything similar?"
"I can see why turning up Adblue would work without reducing performance but I wonder what they are doing to the older cars without Adblue, that's maybe why there are so many contradictory reports on the results?"
Ultimately this could finish VAG in the long run.

"Anyone in the know about the 2017 VED hike announced in the 2015 budget which will hit hard anyone thinking about buying a car over £40,000 from April 2017?"
This explains it pretty wellhttps://www.carwow.co.uk/news/ved-road-tax-from-2017-0182-2060
Maybe it's time Tesla did an proper SUV?
Yes but because the tesla is over 40 grand you will still get hit with a tax hike!
But Tesla do this thing where by you pay extra to unlock more battery potential. So maybe they can sell it for under £40K initially and then you pay the rest later to unlock the cars full potential in stages/steps until it's 100% unlocked?
The Tesla model X (SUV) starts at £76500.The very fast P100D starts at £121800I am due to test drive one later this month.
"New Audi q5 sline TDI 190ps stronic has rrp on the audi website of 39,405. This is the list price which the ved will apply to. Any additional add ons which take the price over 40k will be subject to higher ved rates."
Hopefully it's based on list price.
"Can't see that being the case, they would lose out on too much revenue, car makers would start listing various models at £39,990 with extras such as steering wheels and doors being available options."
Like buying a porsche?
"A friend of mine has one. Using his mobile to have the car come out of the garage, stop and open the door for you is a really cool trick!"
"Think you're probably right but it seems crazy that just adding a factory towbar will cost so much in tax, there's going to be a few 'poverty specs' rolling off the production line.Subaru used to offer a retrofit prodrive upgrade which was very popular as it was warranty friendly and got round the car going into a higher emissions band, I can see other manufacturers starting to offer a lot more in the way of dealer fit aftermarket upgrades."
It's another not-thought-through-properly policy by a government who clearly do not understand the motor industry (or any industry)This is akin to the stamp duty step system when thatwas first introduced.Where do they get these people who decide such matters from?It's quite clear that the proper way to do 'road tax' is to add a clear percentage on to fuel prices
Osborne the feckin prick!!
"Looking at the new configurator the basic price is quoted as £39,405 and the different models are optional extras"
"Anyone in the know about the 2017 VED hike announced in the 2015 budget which will hit hard anyone thinking about buying a car over £40,000 from April 2017?"
"Correct but the paint is an additional cost of 654 I think which may be considered as an ad on option hence making the total price £40,050. Think the key here is every addional item you add on totals towards the ved banding. It's a b*tch I know!!!!"
"I'm sure VW/Audi can work out a 'cheat' way of getting around this new regulation - something like a 39,999 list price for the q5, then, at the first inspection service (now at 100 miles), you'll be able to select from the following 'dealer fit accessories': s-line pack, SQ5 pack, etc.... Audi will then take your car in and swap it for the car you really wanted, with all the VIN plates magically transfered over...I am a genius!"
"Sounds like the way the prices for a new model are coming out, on other thread, the basic shell will cost more than 39,999.All this from an un-tested new factory, location, personnel.....they should be giving existing owners a free 'trial car'"
But who really thinks that this extra duty will actually be implemented next year as I would have thought by now it would be making headlines in all the press if it was definite?
"i don't think the masses will care too much if people who can afford to buy a +40K car have to pay a few hundred quid extra in road-tax for a few years, i reckon it is set in stone, unless Hammond announces something today in his Autumn Statement?if only it was Richard Hammond and not Philip Hammond doing the Autumn Statement - us motorists would be sorted!"
"Sorry to resurrect this old(ish) tread. Does anybody know what the official definition of a cars 'list price' in the VED context is? I've looked all over the internet, but can't find an answer. I know for sure it's the price of the car with all extras before discounts.....but is it before or after the on the road bits have been added? Or is it the price of the car with otr charges minus the VED, as in some cases, the new VED cost could push a car over the £40k threshold?I've had all the above scenarios given to me by different dealerships. If the industry doesn't know, how the hell are we supposed to?"
AFAIK it goes by the list price so I don't think the VED or first registration fee are included.
The government need to think about it. Would bet their is less 40k plus cars sold than cheaper ones it would be better calculated on miles done.

Direct Gov website states that VED will apply to list price so RRP plus the cost of first registration. All of the dealers who I've spoken to are thick as shit. They don't understand the 2017 VED changes. They are under the assumption that it's based on the road price. I've had to correct I don't like being fogged off with inaccurate information. Just think how many customers the dealers have scared off due to poor knowledge.

I wonder how much he has paid for repairs and maintenance and fuel?
"Anyone in the know about the 2017 VED hike announced in the 2015 budget which will hit hard anyone thinking about buying a car over £40,000 from April 2017?"
"Just copied this from the new Q5/SQ5 price list released today on the Audi site. Answers a lot of questions.Vehicles with a list price exceeding £40,000(including factory installed options, delivery charge, number plates and VAT)will pay an additional £310 plus the standard annual rate for a 5 year period. After the 5 year period only the standard rate will apply."
"So, it seems everything except the first year VED and initial registration charge - i.e., everything that's not a government controlled charge....except VAT. So if VAT goes up and puts the price over £40k we pay extra duty. But on fuel, they put the VAT on after the duty, so more duty = more VAT. We're screwed either way, but were's the logic?"
"Someone has to pay for repairs to House of Crooks, Buck Palace et al"

"2015 3.0 TDI (Dieselgate Edition).LOVEthe engine! No clatter, smoke or smell. Massive torque. Brisk acceleration. And great fuel economy if I'm gentle with it.Where I live, the pump price of diesel has been a little lower than regular unleaded since I got my car, and much cheaper than the premium I'd have to run if I had got a TFSI. Factory in the higher MPG (I keep meticulous records), and my calculations show that I've saved between 36.3% to 39.8% in fuel cost per mile in my two years of ownership."
Don't do many miles so TFSI.
TDI every time for me ....... sorry!
TFSI. Can't be arsed with worrying about DPF. Yes I lose some MPG but let's be honest against the amount of money we have all paid for a Q5 it's small change.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

There are times when I'm doing longer journeys but not guaranteed to be regular.I considered the Diesel engine for most of the reasons people bought one (torque, mpg etc) but had that niggling worry from the las time I owned a diesel and problems galore with the DPF.For me the petrol engine is also a very smooth and powerful engine.

"2.0 TDI. Still a better drive than the 2.0 TFSI which I found lacking in torque, noisier and generally less refined. Lower revving diesel suits the car.Anyone concerned about diesel value dropping can protect themselves somewhat by financing through a PCP scheme."

340ps/700Nm BiTDi. Bought for performance reasons not economy. Love rapid performance without wringing it's neck. Had 10 years of V8 petrol and this motor easily matches that performance. Stonkingly good and with the trick exhaust it sounds awesome too.
Mine's a new model 2.0 TDI. Have to say I'm very impressed with it and the car in general. 5000 kms so far and all is well!

Those figures Justanhonestman are impressive - car goes to build end of the month (though order not yet locked) - keeping fingers crossed all these issues you're all coming across are fixed at factory end now
"Justanhonestman said:Hi Nemo -- I must emphasis I don't drive like this all the time lol Dynamic mode gets activated when the wifes not in the car.

But the 35-38 mpg is a regular figure I achieve on a regular journey I take driving 'normally ' in every day traffic along a mixture of A roads and dual carriageway for about 20 miles and sticking to the speed limits.

"12 weeks longer than normal = very long wait!Really sorry for all those waiting for their vehicles, in all my years dealing with Audi I have never known anything like this before."
"Just logged in and I have this as well, is everyone who has an order getting this information or is it targeted to certain people?"
"Far too late for Audi to have ""fessed up"". Their failure until now has not only been terrible customer relations but inevitabley caused suspicion about precisely what the problems have been. Even now their message is waffle, without any specific detail, but I suppose it would be too damaging to identify the issue.A word of comfort for those still enduring a long wait (as I was until 2 weeks ago): the car is excellent: as promised/expected. And so far everything is working well, as indeed it should!"
Well that's one option.Other could well be supply chain issues.
Still waiting to hear about an order number...longest ever in the Audi's ordered over the years...And we were told delivery would be approx 16 weeks and then saw threads here re delays and asked the question to be told late this year which would be around 8 months
I can see the message despite being told by the dealer that the car had left Germany for the UK approx four weeks ago! I will be on the phone again tomorrow (straight after the Lions match!)
"Doesn't help that we are being bombarded by not one, but 2 different TV ads for the new Audi Q5 (now 'It Thinks...') increasing demand for a car they cannot supply.I think there may be a lack of communication and a lot of head scratching going on at Audi right now."
The issue not being picked up and reported by the motoring press is conspicuous by its absence (unless I've missed something?).
"This mess together with lack of diesel option for SQ5 is really putting me off replacing mine anytime soon or, with another SQ5/Q5 ever .............................."
"I'm not sure that they'd automatically pick it up unless approached?I remember about three years ago when we looked at the Q5 it had a 6 month wait, but was a popular car. I'm sure it's popularity is still high, but Audi have compounded lead times with building them in Mexico. Whilst t speeds it up for the US market (who were used to waiting) it slows it down for us in Europe (who weren't used to extended del times) so if Audi can't work a solution out they'll ultimately lose out.Our current order will be 12 weeks from order to build, build to estimated delivery a further 26 weeks."
"So the ""YourAudi"" feed held at ""Quality Control"" now for over a month. Getting blood out of a stone from Audi this is what I have been told.I have now been passed this information, as per our previous correspondence the lead time from completion of production to delivery to the UK is circa 12 weeks, at present a batch of the new A5's and Q5's have been delayed your vehicle is amongst them. They at this stage have limited information as to the reason and this information is being collated and will be sent over to me. They have advised at this stage they cannot confirm how long the delay will be however all affected vehicle will be given a priority on shipping to reduce any impact on the overall delay time​Other than the fact the A5 and Q5 are not built at the same factory (hence if the above is true then there is a platform problem), anyone have any views (I was aware of the 12 week delay from build to PDI, but this is somthing entirely new).​"
"Sounds like a guarantee that the car would be a ""lemon"" if it stuck at quality control with a bunch of other misfits..."
"Sorry to hear about the lack of information from Audi. Thankfully the Q5 I am getting is a stock car. I am not sure when it arrived in the UK, but according to your Audi the factory in Mexico received the factory order on the 14.11.16. It has been in the U.K. At least two weeks."
"So going by Snowman's map, this is and old style Q5 with the delay yes?Are they giving out delivery dates/ transport times for the newbies from Mexico yet?"
The delay is a new Q5 from Mexico
"Sorry to hear that Wuls, mine wasn't a stock order, it has been built and on a ship somewhere, expected delivery is mid April at the moment. Worrying that there is a delay on yours as the new Q5 is meant to be launching next week.To be honest getting any decent information from Audi UK is painful to say the least. They might have run out of certain parts, components?!"
"My order is not for a Q5, so its coming from a different factory.That said the graphic is still wrong as its coming from Neckarsulm i believe.If a stock new Q5 has already landed (which is not from the demo dealer fleet) then the platform comment doesnt seem valid...!"
"Hi (This is my first post.)I have been waiting for a new Q5 since late January 2017. I was told that it would arrive ""early March"". I was later told it had arrived in Emden mid-Feb. Now no-one at the dealer and no-one at Audi UK has any clue when it will be delivered. Audi personnel in Germany are ""not customer facing"". I really want the car but this is shockingly poor customer service. Does anyone know if they're having quality issues? ie are the cars wrecked or don't work? Does anyone know if Audi look at these posts?"
Well neither the dealer or Audi UK has come with anything more than there is a parts issue.My time of the essence clause in the order kicks in towards end of April and I will be cancelling my order and abandoning Audi for another make. The service is unacceptable and the lack of information is appalling.
"I bought a Q5 last Saturday, it's a dealer stock car and was built on 23/01, the dealer reckons I'll get it in the next 2/3 weeks. In the meantime I've offloaded my A4 in P/EX to them today and theyve loaned me an almost new Q3 until mine arrives. Worrying to hear about these delays, but in my case any delays mean I hang on the the loaner longer so it's in their interest to chase up delivery for me. I was surprised I managed to get one in the colour, spec and options that I wanted, given all the fuss about pre-ordering."
I was surprised that I was also able to get a stock vehicle in the colour I wanted plus the couple of options that I wanted.
"Justanhonestman said:Hi guys-- well my Q5 was built on the 23rd January and I received an update in the 'your Audi' tracker that my car was on it's way to the UK from Mexico on the 24th Feb. The ship that I tracked to Emden arrived on the 10th March. I still haven't taken delivery of my car. Audi says they are receiving further checks in Germany and cannot tell me where it is or how long it will be before delivery. So what's going on once the cars arrive in Germany ? Audi is not telling the truth here. Something has gone wrong either with the standards of the Mexico factory, or a problem has been found with the new model. Six ships have left Veracruz since my ship left in February with another two due in the next few days. All these cars coming into Emden with very little going back out to the UK - were not getting told something here. After the emissions scandal Audi will be trying to keep quiet about further problems with the brand, especially as this is their latest model and could seriously damage sales of their best selling model. It's nearly two months since my car was supposedly offloaded at Emden- where is it Audi ? And what's gone wrong ? It may be time to phone that F Pace dealer I think.Click to expand...My Q5 was build week 5.2.17 and I took delivery on the 28.3.17. Touch wood so far no issues with my car and the build quality seems ok, better than my wife's Audi TT roadster. I would be concerned about why my car has been stuck in Emden for this length of time.If you are thinking about the F Pace I would check out the F Pace forum there seems to be quite a few unhappy customers."
"My Q5 has been showing in transit on the way to the UK since around 21st April and I was in blissful ignorance until reading this...As a new user, I will keep this thread updated with any changes, if anyone else waiting can do the same we can share maybe updates on this thread?To the user suggesting he was going to speak to Jaguar about an F Pace, I would suggest having a look at the F Pace forums, there's a lot of car rejections on there..."
"I suppose with it being a brand new model, brand new plant and workforce teething problems will be inevitable. Audi will obviously want to deliver them in A1 condition but they should be doing more to keep you updated on the reason for the delays as a lack of information inevitably results in negative speculation, which, hopefully, will be totally unfounded.Must admit I thought it a little odd that the cars have to go to Germany for QC checks, it doesn't seem to streamline the process and I would have thought the new multi billion pound plant would have that facility anyway?"

$15 a day!!!!!
"FYI, Audi's system does not accurately report where your vehicle is. Mine showed ""in paint shop"" for 3 weeks, and then overnight, it miraculously passes quality control, was transported to the shipyard, loaded onto the ship, and was on its way from Germany to North America.Sadly, it'll get here when it gets here.Just as an FYI, I ordered my Q5 on Feb 23, 2015 and it was ready for pickup from the dealer on May 26. Made in Germany, delivered to Oakville, Ontario, Canada. That as over 3 months."
"How can they have attracted any real talent at 15 bucks per day, their hearts won't be in it and who can blame them? Doesn't bode well, the robots can't do everything - can they?"
Got an email today - it's on its way to the channel ferry and should be with the dealer shortly (order placed mid Nov and build week 9)
On Audi's website there are approx 140 new model Q5's for sale all registered before 1.4.17 so won't be be liable for increased VED. If I was being messed around waiting for news about the delivery of my motor I would seriously consider one of these. Many are fairly well spec'd and generally reasonably priced (and that's before serious haggling).
"In addition to Skiman's suggestion other Audi dealers may also have brand new stock vehicles (like mine was) which they ordered a while back that you may get sooner, so worth trying that route if you're getting nowhere with your order. You might even end up getting one with exactly the spec you were after, I did."
"Just looking at London dealers within 20 miles of where I live, it's all Diesels. Given expected share of the TFSI in London was estimated to be 40% (due to the new regs etc) it does point towards it being a petrol-related issue being the cause of the delay"
I got my TFSI new Q5 in march. But I had a 2016 build week. No significant delays Then.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Justanhonestman said:Hi Markee68 - welcome to the forum. You may have read some of my other posts about the nightmare I am having trying to find out where my car is and when I will get it. Built on 23/24 th January and its been lost since. You say your car has been on its way to the UK from around 21st April. I take it you mean it left Veracruz around then. Three ships left Veracruz in April. Viking Queen left on 1st April and arrived Emden on the 19th. Splendid Ace left on 10th April and is about to dock after midnight early tomorrow 3rd May. Viking Bravery left on 14th April and is entering the English Channel tonight (2cnd May)---- if you meant your car was on its way from Emden to the UK around the 21st April --- 15th April ship arrived in tyne after a drop off in Grimsby from Emden--- 21st - 26th and 28th April ships arrive in Tyne from Emden---.It was me who mentioned going to see the F Pace lol. It was out of sheer frustration at how I and others are being treated by Audi. I really am near to calling it a day with them. Tight lipped dealers and various reasons for the delays from customer services are creating suspicion as to what's going on or happened to cars from Mexico. I have ordered the petrol engine which makes me think they have found fault after the recent recall concerning the electric coolant pump motor which can overheat with the potential to catch fire as it can get choked up with debris getting in under the bonnet. Anyway- like the emissions scandal, the real reasons for these delays may eventually surface. The longer this goes on, the less excited I am about getting this car. A total shambles from Audi.Click to expand...Hi, thanks for the welcome.I looked up the Volkswagen Group shipping schedule as detailed on other forums and the nearest ship to my shipping date I could find was the Viking Adventure. I've no idea if this is correct as it's all a guessing game, but according to the schedule this is due in Emden on May 18th. I've ordered a diesel by the way."
Hi Markee68 sorry for the delay in answering. If your ship is the Viking Adventure - it left Veracruz on the 8th May and is sitting in Jacksonville right now (16-00 hrs 12th May ) It has been taking between 16 to 19 days for ships to arrive at Emden from Veracruz via Jacksonville/Davisnille. So your ship could arrive at Emden between the 24th and 27th May - if it was on that ship. Athens Highway is due in from Veracruz around 13th May and Columbia Highway is due around 19th May. It's a nail biting experience but stick with it.
"Thanks, no problem at all. I have been tracking the Viking Adventure onvesselfinder.com. I know it's all a guessing game, but it's going to be quite interesting to see if this ships timescales tie in with the YourAudi tracking - does the status change when it arrives in Emden, or just when it gets to the UK?I'm quite relaxed about the wait, looking forward to my third Audi, but I like my current car and it's lease doesn't expire until mid June. Not panicking yet!"
"Justanhonestman said:I received an update in 'your Audi' tracker telling me my car had left Veracruz and on its way to the UK via Jacks/Davis/Emden then onto UK. The next update I got was an actual e-mail telling me my car had been loaded onto a ship heading to the UK. It's no wonder customers get frustrated with the lack of tracking ability for your order. I found the updates I got were about 4-5 days late. So count back a few days from your updates to get a better idea of your position. Crazy stuff and Audi need to look at their tracking system which is just putting customers against the brand before they even get their car. Best of luck. If that is your ship in Jacksonville, it takes around 3-4 days to get to Davisville then 8 to 10 days to get to Emden. As I write this post- its still docked in JacksonvilleClick to expand...Just had a look at vesselfinder this morning and it looks like it's left Jacksonville.As for the YourAudi tracking, if there are offering this facility, at least make sure it's accurate, if it's not accurate I'd personally rather they didn't bother as it just gives misleading information."

"Hi MLBevo_80A unless Audi have got their logistics in order, I would allow a minimum of 12 weeks from build date to delivery.

"Same as mine, went to status 30 (left factory) on 20th April and still the same today. Audi (dealer) can't tell me where the car is, or how long it's going to take, only that it's somewhere between Mexico and Emden. Shocking when you think about it."

"Hi Guys,Been a while since I posted but just sharing a recent experience. Thinking Audi extended warranty is not worth the paper its written on. Extended it for my R8 last month (2013 V10 plus) then noticed after cleaning it the other week was getting moisture in the NSR light cluster, fast forward 2 weeks and the lense bonding is failing to its starting to come away from the main unit. Took it into the dealer 2 weeks ago to then be told today they declined it!!!Spoke to the warranty people direct and they tell me its not covered even though I have ""All Component Cover""!!!Rediculous!!!MT"
How random is that - did they say why it wasn't covered? I'd have thought with it being all component it would've been?I've always had it on previous cars when the option has come up and admittedly have been lucky as the couple of issues that have cropped up have been covered by them.Are they classing lense bonding as wear and tear?
"Yes they are classifying the bonding as a seal (i.e rubber = perishable) which is not the case. Been in contact with them and explained it as evidently the dealers description is the issue and they are going back to the dealer to clarify. Now getting hold of the dealer is proving painful, not returning calls or emails. Getting very fed up with them now, considering I own 3 Audi's (R8, SQ5 & mk3 TT) all purchased in the last 3 years you would think I would be a valued customer. Their arrogance will be their undoing in this case!!If anyone is wondering the dealer in question is Southampton Audi. VERY POOR service so far!MT"

"Hi PRT interesting reading for sure. I read another article on the logistical problems Audi were having to overcome. I also read an article about the port of Veracruz and how because so many manufacturers were using the same port, they could only hold a shipment of cars for 10 to 14 days as there is not enough holding areas for everybody. I feel this move to Mexico was to pander more to the American market to reduce their delivery times tp the USA. Maybe things will smooth out once the plant gets up and running with a fully trained workforce. Surely these long delivery times to the UK cannot continue."
"Hi JustanhonestmanAfter waiting 7,5 weeks in Quality control my car is now on route to the port, hopefully finger cross will not have to wait to long for a ship !"
"Just to compound everyone's misery, Audi have taken the Tracker down for routine service maintenance, just for a couple of days!!!!"
Hi Rubyslad - lets hope it is down to work on improving the way customers can track their cars and make it more accurate and informative. Not being able to track your car from when it left Mexico till it was loaded onto a boat heading to the UK is a waste of time and just creates anger and confusion between customer and dealrship. Even trying to track the ship your car is on is a guess as the updates you receive can be 4 or 5 days behind the actual event.
"Audi Q5 Configurator is also down.Seems you cannot configure a car for a factory order, and you can now not track a factory order either.Audi fail."
"In an attempt to ease your pain in waiting (I waited 3 loooooong months for my 2015 Q5), know that the trackers is not accurate. Your car may appear appear to be ""stuck"" in one location for many days, or even weeks (mine was in the paint shop for 3 weeks), and then suddenly jump through several steps in one go. The best you can do, is try to release the ""is it here yet"" eagerness, breath, relax, etc. Wishing you the best in these long days :-/"
"Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrggggggghhhh!!!!Just as the ship I'm tracking is just around the corner from Emden (not that I know if my car is on there, of course, it's all a guessing game)."
"Hmmm it's been more than a couple of days, doesn't take that long for maintenance. There's more to this I think."
"You can still get status information by logging on to ""Your Audi"" and then click on this:https://www.audi.co.uk/myaudi-public-api/services/v1/ordersEven though tracker is down, just been able to find out my S4 is now on a boat out of Emden."
How can you log in to YourAudi if it's down for maintenance?
When you get to the page telling you it's down for maintenance hit the hyperlink and watch for the results.
"Ahh got you, that worked, thank you."
What's the general consensus on order status 38? Had a few different ideas.... does it means it's about to leave Mexico?

My advice is dont go buying the third party puddle lights. There's been a discussion on one of the forums and they've compared the originals vs 3rd party. Original have some sort of vent to release the heat which some of the 3rd party ones didn't and conversely became very hot.No point risking anything for sake of £60
"How long do you have your doors open for to allow the bulbs to get hot?The lights are LED's - I've never felt the slightest bit of heat off them even when i had them lit and in my hand as I was fitting them.I've had them for years now with no issue (except for cutting out the DAB occasionally when the door opens), and from what I remember there is a timer cut-out anyhow?"
No idea...I don't have them but have read a fair few posts across the forums about the 3rd party logo bulbs ????????
the Audi portal is a bit of a mess for the Q5 - the PriceList is for the MY18's but the Configurator and Brochures are still for the MY17's.you can learn more from the Price List than the brochures or Configurator.my dealer is telling me that if i order now I will get a MY18 car - but i can only order a MY17 car?
The profit margin on these cars must be pretty big but they've got to scrape the dosh together for their multi billion $ fine somewhere I suppose.
"Justanhonestman said:Hi guys- about the price increases. When I ordered my Q5 S-Line last November you could order electric front seats separatly from electric mirrors. Somebody somewhere must have noticed that they run off the same memory module so the two options bacame one. When I ordered my car the electric seats were £700 and the mirrors £250.Now when you tick the electric seats option, another window opens up telling you that the seats must be ordered in conjunction with electric mirrors with memory. So that's £200 extra right away. Seats are now £800 and mirrors £350 Then there was the increase in road tax for cars over £40000. That took the first years tax/showroom tax to £500. In the configurator the picture of the standard S-Line steering wheel does not show the aluminium finishing piece with the S-Line logo. The lighting pack says the cupholders are illuminated along with the doors/footwells etc They are not- I got the extended lighting pack and they still have no lighting whatsoever.If Audi cannot get their configurator right, that attitude of not listening to or caring about their customers must surely filter down to production level. The Q5 prices used to start around £32500 to £37-38000. Now they start around £37500 or there abouts- for what ? That's a helluva price increase for a car that doesn't offer much more than the previous model. An increase in the amount of plastic around the interior, and a nice new front grille made of plastic all being fitted by a low paid workforce, all combine to line Audi's pockets with a fair bit of extra cash.

Completely agree! But it could all 'speed up' in coming months. Issue you have is to get the car from Mexico to Germany is at least a 2-4 week process?Is the SQ made in Mexico? Thought a while back all S/RS models were all made in Germany...but this could have been as all the Audi's were?
"Hi guys - about the pricing of these extras (that annoy me ). Ok the technology pack is to include the virtual cockpit at £1395. When I speced up my car, if you tried to spec the virtual cockpit in the configurator, it says it can only be configured with the addition of the technology back at £1100. Now they say its included !!! With both costing an additional £45 from when I ordered mine. The cost of this car is slowly going up and up with sneaky little price rises being hidden behind announcements that make you think you are getting a good deal. They are in danger of pricing this car above what it's really worth. In fact, I think they already have."
"Don't buy then, but Audi have the dieselgate costs to rake back and now with BREXIT the currency weakness."
"Not sure about that, Audi are practiced at setting up factories outside germany.It could be worse the car could be made in india!!!!!!!!Audi have cut quality IMO on the newer model since the well known troubles and hit to their cashflow. You see it in the Q5 where the door card are covered in cheap alcantara rather than full leather, the door pulls are PVC and the plastics towards the bottom of the car somewhat golf like. Regardless of Audis woes, if the car has issues you should bring it up with the dealer and ensure they correct to your satisfaction or take back the car - don't accept 2nd best."

"Don't get me wrong the MK2 is a huge step up from the MK1 in every way esp in the driving stakes, but the penny pinching has spoilt what could have been an epic winner for Audi.Q5 is not a flagship car in anyway i would recognise.It's Audis volume car for the SUV market."
As far as I know the SQ5 is made alongside the Q5 on the Mexico line. I'll keep an eye on here for SQ5 order/delivery times people are quoting to see the right time to potentially order...Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro

"Just received a mailshot:Drive The Deal currently offering Q5 2.0 Tdi S-line , 5 door, S Tronic for £36,425.This implies a 10% discount available already off the brand new model."
I got the same email. But correct me if I am wrong I think the deal is only for cash purchases and not linked to the audi pcp solutuon product as of yet.
Sign of the times? Most other manufacturer's are offering discounts.
I got 7.5% plus a generous p/e allowance for a stock vehicle. Demonstrators are also appearing on dealer websites with reasonable reductions. When I was looking for a deal some dealers even from the same group wouldn't give any discounts which seemed a bit odd. Any way there loss etc etc.
"Call Clydesdale and get them to do a quote for HP with a balloon, it's not a GFV but an estimate but their rate will put dealer PCPs to shame. You can then order through drivethedeal and Clydesdale will sort out paying the supplying dealer. Job done!Let me know if you need a contact at Clydesdale.Cheers"
It just tells me that list price is artificially inflated to begin with!
Hmmm. Hot sellers usually don't require steep discounts to get them moving.
"I agree, I think manufacturers over inflate their RRP as they know customers expect discounts. If customers are stupid enough not to negotiate hard then that's even more profit for them. Drive the deal has already been mentioned, for example they are advertising a C class Merc with a saving of 34%. This would suggest there are sizable margins for them to play with, even with a weak £."
"In the U.K. There has been record sales for new reg plate registrations in March, this is partly due to vehicle excise duty changes that will make many vehicles more expensive to purchase from April.Many in the motor trade expect sales in the U.K. to decline for the rest of this year, so it will be interesting to see what happens with regard to discounts. I suspect dealers will be under even greater pressure to shift new motors."
"Currently on the look for a Q5 and noticed that both DtD and Broadspeed are 10% off - think Broadspeed came in at 10.7% overall - was shocked if I'm honest that, that was the level they were offering already"
I would say that we shouldn't get too hung up about discounts alone (unless you are not p/exchanging your motor). Some times many dealers give a generous discount but a poor part exchange value or vice a versa depending on what they think the customer wants to hear. It's always going to be about the price to change or monthly payments. In my case got about 7.5% plus a pretty reasonable p/e price for my car. So the overall price to change was a lot better than I had anticipated.
Totally agree...existing car will be sold privately.Will see what dealers can do once driven and spec'd ????????
I ran a new Q5 through CarWow - best i could get was 3.7% discount!
Can someone PM me that email please? I never got it and can only find a few percent discount so far.Thank you.
to compound matters the list price on the new Q5 goes up by £750 shortly as they move towards MY2018 cars
"If I had the time to max the best deal possible I would also have tried to sell my motor privately. Once you sell your motor, if you pardon the pun you will be in the driving seat when negotiating the best deal possible. Hope you enjoy your test drive of the Q5. If you can try to get the car without the sales guy being present as it's hard I think to really evaluate the vehicle with sales staff being present."
"Do you know the date of increase at all? As you get no 'extra' spec for this and the options will no doubt increase in price.I know the tech pack increases to £1,395 but now includes VC and Comfort & Sound Pack you loose the elec seats but get reversing camera I think it was.So if ordered pre increase and car build date post wk22 therefore MY18 can only assume you'd get VC in tech pack and lose elec seats in Comfort pack?"
I've recived a 10% discount today via my dealer to upgrade to the new sports trim line. So basically got 4k off the price. Does anybody know how far into the life of the new Q5 before any sort contributions will be introduced?
"Demru - mind me asking which Dealership this was - if you have a particular sales rep you would like to recommend can you PM me please?I am not finding much discount at all so far, but have a meeting in a couple of weeks with Wimbledon Audi who supplied my previous 2 Q5's, I'd like to go well armed."
"Just received a mailshot:Drive The Deal currently offering Q5 2.0 Tdi S-line , 5 door, S Tronic for £36,425.This implies a 10% discount available already off the brand new model."
"As we enter the era of the 40k VED jump Audi need to be careful pricing their models that can cross over that barrier. My 2013 Q5 was 45k at list price but I got it easily for under 40k through Drive the Deal - nowadays that would fall foul of the premium tax. If they list priced them more honestly so more fully spec'd cars came in under the level, but offered less discounts they could save the customer money, and make more themselves.Audi aren't the worst mind - the discounts on new BMWs are outrageous as evidenced by the drive-the-deal list above. What's the point of listing a car for £45k, get hit with the VED levy and then selling it to people for £33k?!"
I agree with you. It's outrageously pathetic. You would think that these hot shot marketing and finance people at dealership brand would think like you but obviously Not!! You have a really good point.
I've sent you the details.
"Marshall group (Audi Newbury maybe your closest) are keen to do deals at the moment 7% + are achievable, also Carfile are very good and where offering 7.5% discount and you deal direct with the dealer."
Deal all in place for us just need to make the decision on which engine - TFSI or TDI
If lower depreciation is key for you why not ask about GFV for each version on those finance package thingys
That's a good call....????????The car will be with us for 5yrs is think - it's just if they make some silly laws re use of diesel cars that is the factor to consider otherwise diesel would be ordered in a heartbeat
so what is the maximum discount anyone is really managing on a new Q5 purchase?
"There are so many things which can go wrong in the next 5 years. Brexit, another 5 years of that wicked witch and it seems like WWIII is only a heartbeat away. The only certainty is whichever make / model you buy will be worth very little after 5 years.Don't let doom and gloom determine your choices. Your glass is half full, be glad you can afford a new Q5."
"The drop has started to accelerate for SQs thats for sure, I cant really comment on base models.You really need to go on what people are getting offered for them; you just cant get close to what the online valuations are.I guess it all depends how bad you want out... but its not going to get better."
"Trading the car after only 8 months will surely hurt your pocket. However, I do not believe depreciation on your Q5 will be much worse than it would have been on any other Audi.I am perfectly happy with my SQ5. I certainly wouldn't consider swopping it for an S3, but maybe an RS3."
"HB14 said:Good evening everyone,The new Q5 is horrendousI'd be interested to know from other Q5 owners what your thoughts are and whether you have considered the new Q5?RegardsHBClick to expand...Not sure why you are asking what others think about the new Q5 when you appear to have made your mind up. Obviously it's a lot about personal taste but what is it you consider to be horrendous?But, as you have asked, I like it and I have ordered one."
Was offered £26750 for our 14 plate SQ5 with 45000 miles today against an S3.
"It's going to be an expensive exercise anyway you look at it.however, you mention the the new SQ5 being nowhere to be seen, so assuming you're interested in one, why not look at the latest possible current model SQ5, which are depreciating quicker than your S-line Plus.You may get an upgraded vehicle for the minimum crossover money that way."
SQ - IF they ever appear with the restructuring and mass cost cutting currently happening within VAG...All recent Audis have launched with S cars from the start.
"Great replies so far. By know means am I slating those who purchased the new Q5, as for for me it ticks every box with Audi's latest technology. However, for me its more cosmetic. And, as such until the Q5 gets further down I can't see Audi releasing exterior upgrades, wheels, black pack etc. I've not considered the current SQ5 as I was worried about the bridge over but I'll have a look into it."
"S3 is a very different experience to the SQ5, we are lucky enough to have both and I must admit to preferring the S3, Wife and daughter prefer the SQ5. We have the super sports seats and they're very comfortable and fine to do 400 miles in a day in - you'll have to fill up though, 50L tank isn't that large - currently showing 32mpg on the DIS after 26K"
"The only way to save some money is to try and avoid the trade in, i.e (try to) sell yours privately then go cash in hand for next one.Would be a hassle probably, but you could try on here for starters to see if any interest.It seems a lot of people (including me) are happy they've bought the last model of current version, so when it's no longer available new, there should be a decent market for 'nearly new' like yours."
"Where in Surrey are you HB14 ? If your dealer has 50+ cars to sell, maybe it's time for me to buy one"
"Just had a look at Audi's used cars and there are 132 used SQ5's for sale many of which are 2016!! Prices right upto £50,000. What's going on here then???"
"Probably Audi finance rates ( 10.9% I think ) which means it's much cheaper to buy new.I asked about a 190 s-line plus which was £37k a few months ago. £4K down, 48 months, 8k pa and Audi wanted £850 pcm !Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"You can get a NEW factory ordered SE+ in that range, something in the 50k for used example is laughable"
Our Sep '15 which is fully loaded with nearly £7k of options (I know this doesn't flow through) that was £52k new is now getting offers of £32k from WBAC.About to swap from a Tesla Model X so probably going to just break even on the finance
It's certainly the newer SQ cars that are taking the biggest hit.
"To be honest I'm still very much in two minds, The best offer I have had is just under £31k. I'm still contemplating holding in with the car until summer next year however I'm worried I won't even break even on finance."
"Don't go to wbac, dealer margins on SQS are only about £2K at the moment and they are paying well above top CAP.I know nothing about Tesla but am guessing the dealership probably have Audi somewhere on their books as well. They'll just move it to another branch and put a £40k sticker on it."
"Would imagine Audi dealer margins are likely to be around £3-4,000 as if they are based on what I have been offered on mine minus what it costs to 'showroom it up' the ticket price on forecourt will no doubt be around the £40,000 mark."
"WBAC are actually paying above Audi in most cases.As above, Audi have a cost they have to realise for anything they throw on the forecourt."
"Not with me they weren't around £2,000 less."
I'm the other way around...
"Just had mine valued on WBAC out of interest.7 months old, 7,000 miles ( see signature) ......was around £43k on configurator, got 11% discount =£38.2k ishWBAC say £26.8k..About identical to what I got for my 2yr old 14 model when trading in for this one, and still getting the 11% off new.Either WBAC are not receiving too many 2nd hand Q5's, or, the Q5 is dead in the water, yesterdays news."
Wow some scary figures going around. Any Q5 owners out there that have recently traded in? I'd be keen to know if anyone is even in positive equity. If not ill bite the bullet and cut my losses and sell for £31k.
"I really wouldn't use WBAC as a barometer. Any time I've looked at them, their price has been woeful.Best looking at Autotrader for private sales and find what those closest to your spec, year and mileage are selling at. Those at the lower end of the range have probably already advertised at the higher prices and got no bites. I've had most success selling on AT at lowest price +5% or so."
"AT is not going to give you any indication as to what to expect from a trade in, its a resale price.Audi who use CAP and WBAC are the market barometers IMO."
"sj1000 is absolutely correct - trying to sell at less than a year or two is just throwing money away.But to both sj1000 and snow man, my point was absolutely about what you could expect in a private sale rather than a trade sale. It's definitely worth looking at AT to see what you could get for your vehicle privately, especially if it still has a dealer / manufacturer warranty on it."
And the other positives are?
Lol - surely you'd didn't just recently buy a £50K car purely because it was fast?
Its also not aFerrarisuggest we leave it at that......
"Q5 is showing its age, you cant hide that. The current car is behind many of the mercs i tested over the last few weeks."
"Its actually irrelevant what marque it is just that its 10ish year old technology that Audi are expecting you to pay the thick end of £50,000 in order to get from 0-62 in 5.1 seconds. If you take £50,000 and go shopping for another marque with similar spec you will be surprised what you can get that has modern technology driving it. I have no problem with my SQ5 its my second Audi in recent years the first being a Q5 and yes they are fine but lets not fool ourselves into thinking that they are cutting edge as when you buy a SQ5 most people are only interested in how fast it goes otherwise they would buy a Q5, surely? As for those who say they want diesel etc not sure how strong an argument that is nowadays."
"SteveMcB said:Fair enough point re the age thing, but surely it's no worse a car now that it was a year or two back? I ordered mine last November with eyes wide open about likely impact of the new one. I spent much more time mulling this decision over than any other purchase I've ever made, including property, and think that's why I'm still happy.I was a cash buyer so know little of PCPs etc but the thought of basically giving away a car that I was happy with just a few months ago doesn't sit well with me at all.I had a hankering after a Macan recently but another decent run in the SQ (and slap about the head) sorted out that wibble.As far as being behind Merc, I don't know about that, except for a 10 yr old SL I haven't driven any for a while. It genuinely wouldn't matter to me if their residuals are better (are they?) because I just don't like them.Click to expand...I just don't know in terms to resales values, sorry.Worse/better? well the position changes as you compare to other models around at the point in time.It would be fair to say if you had a utopian ""best"" list, the Q5 will have steadily dropped down the list as it aged and or newer (competing) models are released."
"Actually I don't see it as that much of a hit for a car about to end its days. I couldn't hire an SQ5 for £700 a month and got a good discount (nearly £7,000) -had to search it out and discount beats all on-line broker deals- most Mercedes dealers think that if you can afford a Merc then you can afford to pay list. Eh no, I don't think so!! Overall its only costing me £11,000 plus what I got for my car for the new Mercedes but if I was foolish enough to pay full list it would not have been a goer in the first place so taking away the £7,000 from depreciation costs brings it down to around £3,500 and that's fine with me for a new model AMG car."
Strange you should ask my brother bought a new 911 and he let me drive it around for a week or so and it does its job well but in the end I need a load lugger so for the moment it has to be an estate type car but may take his off his hands when it changes it in a couple of years as he's just like me with cars.................. just to add the 911 is well overpriced for what you get better off staying with your SQ5.
"New 911s are very, very nice but the 718 Cayman is much better value IMO - absolutely no use as a load lugger though. Mind you, you could always buy a Macan with the change - nuts!"
"Yes its crazy really and I understand that the 911 is 'The' Iconic sports car but the prices are staggering even Porsche SUVs are silly money, but Porsche get away with it and their 'no discount' policy helps keep used prices high but when buying it hurts that you cannot do a deal which is what I like to do when spending new car money. All in all a car is just a means of transport so I never get too attached to mine and over the years have never kept a car for a long time its just the way I am. In the end its pointless comparing one car with another as they all effectively do the same job but some do it faster or more luxuriously than another but you pays your money you take your choice."
A myth. I got a discount when I bought mine.
"Not been approached like you rifleman, but we stopped by our dealer the other day to look at the new Q5 and the guy who sold us our car said something similar. I got the feeling they're looking for nearly new, low mileage, high value cars for used stock that will still command the lower VED rates that applied pre April 1st. I think they've taken a bit of a hit with orders of £40k+ cars after the VED increase and are looking to help their figures along!.... Just my tuppence worth."
Very valid point indeed. Mine only has 13K on the clock and is still immaculate. I can't see how they are going to give me a good deal given the PCP has only been active for a year.
"Rifleman,I've not been approached, however my dealer knows I have been looking at swapping to something different. I have only 9k but the prices im getting are only just going to cover finance settlement, even with 8k down and a huge discount!"
not good news at all.i was approached by Audi regarding my last Q5 when it was 29 months old telling me it was the best time to sell.my current Q5 is just 13 months old when approached by Audi telling me it is the best time to sell.that's quite a concerning difference in a car's peak value age just because there is a new kid on the block.
If it walks like a duck. Dealers regularly approach everyone on their list and will tell you any BS to get a sale.
"they don't seem bothered about the sale as they warned me they will not be able to deliver any new factory order Q5 before 2018, they just said now is a good time based on the value of my car right now using their Audi Valuation application / tools they use."
"It seems a bit odd that the dealer's trying to persuade you to change so soon, makes me wonder what their angle is but one thing's for sure any deal will be to their benefit and probably not yours?FWIW my opinion is that your current car is a very nice example so, if it still meets your needs, be content with it for at least a couple more years, at least until the new model is more firmly established and we know what effect the new VEL rules are having on the second hand market for cars just the wrong side of £40K, ie new Q5 territory.I plan on keeping mine for a lot longer than that."
"Due to being away with work & flying via Munich. I spotted a new shape Q5 in the airport lobby, being advertised.It was a LHD with S Line badges. It seemed to be Nordic Grey which I love in the RS3 & RS7 & the interior really impressed me. Same seats as my SQ5 plus & rear infotainment screens.A visit to the dealer when I get home.Any ideas when the SQ5 will launch? Also, when will we see a diesel version?Rappy"
"Petrol can't be far away, I'm getting offers to buy 'in stock' items on Carwow, which I can only assume are dealer orders somewhere in the pipeline, no mention of prices though!!Not heard anything about the diesel."
You can order the SQ5 now? Haven't seen one mind but have seen a few of the Q5s on the road and tested the 2.0TDi last week
How was your test-drive?What are the key differences you noticed between the old and the new Q5?
"That's the worrying thing - another £800 increase on Q5s coming in for MY18 build week and no doubt a few of the options will go up at the same time - so in a few days £1k more.I think the premium brands will need to do something sooner rather than later as surely the badge can only go so far...We are trying desperately to get the order confirmed in next few days to miss out on price increase even though a couple of spec items which would've been nice to have we can't yet as Audi U.K. Are slow in bringing them to UK market...Ireland, Germany etc all have them"
Each time there was a price rise on the previous facelifted Q5 the option prices remained the same.
"They've slightly tweaked a couple...Tech Pack - Current £1.1kVirtual C - Current £250MY18 Tech Pack includes VC £1,395Also tweaked Comfort & Sound Pack contents but same price.But yes rest all look the same...have just priced same car as per Saturday on broadspeed just now and it's £1.1k more ????"
"You should be able to haggle with them over the £800 to £1100 price difference, I was surprised how much I was able to knock them down no still got a PX value for my previous car that was almost £3k more than those thieves at WBAC."
"stevew said:Audi CS'Thanks for providing these details, Steve. We've spoken to the Audi Sales Office who've advised it's in transit from the Factory to Emden, this status change took place on 24 March 2017. It will then be transported by ship from Emden to Grimsby. The lead time from logistics is usually around 12 weeks for the vehicle to arrive in the UK. We're happy to keep providing updates if you'd like to check back with us.'Dealer'Great news is that it is built and still showing in transit from factory! I will continue to keep an eye on your new Q5 but it seems to be in that grey area somewhere between Mexico and Germany right now.'Along with the 'yourAudi' tracker showing a ship and the ocean, I assumed just that... the car was on a ship on its way to Germany. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and on a later requested for an update, they said it had 'left port' on 19th April so only from then was it actually moving across the ocean.All very frustrating in this day and age as most of us waiting are. I even asked a few times what ship the car was on but rather than 'it hasn't actually left on a ship yet Mr Williams' I was just told they didn't have that information.Perhaps I'm / we're craving too much information these days and should just wait until the 6 months (advised lead time) from order is up before asking questions?!Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...I don't think in this day and age (particularly with modern technology) it's unrealistic to be be given accurate or honest information about the status of your considerable purchase.

"Great news, for me personally hearing that my vehicle had finally arrived at Emden was the most defining moment that the vehicle was nearly here. Just knowing that the motor had at last travelled across the Atlantic rather than being "" in transit "" for weeks. Hopefully the additional quality control checks under taken won't take too long and you get the long awaited call from the dealer asking when you want to collect it."
"So the vehicle is built in mexico, then travels to germany, leaves germany and is then on its way to you in the UK?What is the wait like in germany - days, weeks or months? Do they carry out quality control checks in germany or is it just passing through there to centralise their entire european supply chain?Your patience of 6 months+ is admirable!"
"This ""Mexico transition"" has always bothered me, from Day 1, and always prevented me from signing up again.Talk about a torturous journey to get a ""German""/ (Mexican) built car, to your driveway??It still has to go through Germany for quality control ??!!I can see why the USA market is not impressed... send the European models back thru Germany ( just incase, to have a little last-minute look)But the ones going into USA direct from Mexico ?? ----Ah, no worries, they'll be fine mate."
Hi guys- my car arrived in Emden on 10th March. I tracked the ship through Jacksonville- Davisville to Emden after being updated that my car was 'on its way' from Mexico. The next update was on the 3rd May telling me my car has been loaded onto a ship heading for the UK (Tyne). The update was around 7 days late as the ship had arrived in Tyne on the 26th April. So from landing in Emden to arriving in Tyne took around 7 weeks. I now have no nails left after biting them down to the nuckles in anticipation. I would think things should improve as time goes on and potential worries about quality are resolved. I think Audi were playing it safe with the first batches of cars to arrive. Mud sticks remember - and that's the last thing Audi needs after the emissions scandal.

Not sure of exact dates as I had kind of given up bothering chasing for details but I do know that the car left the Mexico port on 19th April and arrived in Grimsby yesterday (10th May).It would be interesting to know how long the journey is from Mexico to Emden via the US ports.

True. Expectations will be even higher! Maybe just give up the brand cachet and get decent value on something cheaper.
Hi all just sold my 330d and looking for an SQ5. Are there any issues with the SQ5 to be aware of? Is the Audi warranty a must? Also what are the essential resale options? Have put a wanted ad on the marketplace too.. really like the look of them and needed the bigger boot!Thankyou
"You will be fortunate to find a good one, less than 3 years old for your budget."
"yeah, that was my thoughts too."
Hi All my Q5 is now coming up to 4 years old and I'm thinking of using an independent for the next service.I live in the Upminster/Brentwood area of Essex and was wondering in anyone on this forum had used or could recommend one in my area.Dibs
"If Chelmsford is an option these were good with our BMW,https://www.pmwltd.co.uk"
"When the towbar is out the camera picks up the top of it so the blind spot is quite small, less than 100mm I'd guess."
On my SQ5 you can see the lip on the rear bumper.
"I can't see any bodywork on mine either. I suggest you carry out some trials. Reverse until you get a constant tone, then get out and check how much space you have behind the car."
"thank you all for your feedback so far, my vehicle did not come with a reversing camera so I have the factory reversing camera kit and the xcarlink aftermarket kit.This is with the xcarlink aftermarket rear camera because it also enables fitment of a front camera, DVB-T digital tv and wireless smartphone mirroring.Testing continues, I may end up fitting the genuine audi reversing camera kit after all."
"That picture looks better resolution than mine, if I was you I'd stick with it. Maybe get someone to hold a ruler against the bumper while you check the camera then you'll be able to see exactly how much wiggle room you've got?"
I have genuine camera and cannot see the bumper.
"yeah it's an odd one, some users above say they can and others cannot.thank you all for your feedback, it certainly helps my aftermarket vs factory reversing camera dilemma.the xcarlink allows me to also fit a front camera which will come in handy from time to time."
"Paid a bit more attention today, turns out I can see about 3"" of bumper."
My wife was involved in a minor accident yesterday where someone drove out of a parking space into the side of our q5. It has caused a very minor dent to the body work and the alloy.Insurance company informed but my gut feeling is it's not wirth claiming with an excess of £350.Any ideas on rough cost of a single alloy refurbishment?
"Alloy repair circa £100.If it was 3rd party fault, you should be able to reclaim your excess, however it may affect your next renewal premium."
"^^^^^^what he said. Car insurance is one of the biggest modern day cons. I've had 2 ""claims"" in the last 4 years where people have driven into my parked car (one was on my own drive when the neighbours handbrake failed). Both sorted without issue through the other party's insurance but my premium is now £350 higher as I'm now seen as a higher risk."
"My premium is also increased due to a vandalism and a no fault accident.To be fair, those who have a no fault incident are more likely to have another. Higher risk = higher premium."
"Yep, insurers are assessing risk and base premiums only on that.Repairs - see a garage, they would be the best people to advise you of costs and once you have those you can pick which direction makes more sense."
"If you were considering getting it repaired at your own cost, you should have waited before informing your insurance provider. Now it doesn't matter what you choose to do as that incident will follow you around for next 3/4 years on your insurance record and be passed along even if you change provider, even if you were totally not at fault. It's all about calculation of risks these days."
"Hi all,I have inserted the radio removal keys, the MMI unit comes out a fair way in my Audi SQ5 but nowhere near enough to disconnect the wiring on the back, as if there is still something holding it back. ELSAWIN only mentions inserting the removal keys and pulling the MMI out, no mention of any further steps required.Has anyone else tried to remove this unit and did it just slide out with the radio removal keys or was there anything else holding it in place?Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide."

Try Auto Union trading they trade exclusively in Audis and have got a few well specced new Q5s at discounted prices that dealers struggle to match.

"My bad, it's £37k before discount with £3300 off so around 9% less than list."
I presume they'd take payment from a 3rd party lender that are usually cheaper anyway.
I always think anyone who spends nearly £40K on a car then has to stick a phone in their windscreen for Sat-Nav is mental and hasn't thought their purchase through.Get it integrated and stop messing around with plugging phones into a holder on your windscreen just to navigate anywhere in your gorgeous car - it really does take the icing off the cake.
"Agree 100% with that, I'd never buy a prestige car that doesn't have integrated oem nav even though I rarely use it. Always makes me wonder what else the previous owner had skimped on when it's a used car, possibly unfair of me but that's just me.I almost fell into the trap when looking for my SQ5, saw a stunning car with low miles, very low price and great spec and just presumed nav was fitted as it wasn't mentioned. Turns out it wasn't, the dealer admitted it's sacrilege to not have it these days hence him asking £2k less for the car than most others. He started talking about retrofits but he'd lost my interest by that point!"
"while i agree, some people have a budget be it a hard or soft one and compromises have to be made.."
Fair one - I'd be driving a fully loaded SQ5 - if I could afford it!
i agree 100%...that is true
"I test drove one on Thursday and commented on it in the ""Spotted"" section - very nice."
did you have a Q5 before this one? what made you go for a Petrol over Diesel?
I don't do a lot of long drives. I've had a diesel before (not an Audi I must say) but had issues with the DPF.I was wary of spending £40oddK to have to always be wary of the clearing the DPF out and making sure the engine is warm.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

"Hi Chaps, be interested to know when you ordered? I ordered in late November and not getting delivery until July!!! I was originally told April. Might be to do with the spec. But seemed ages to me."
Wow that really is not good news. The Q5 that I am collecting on Saturday was ordered by the dealer (with just a couple of options) on the 14th November the build week was week 5 and arrived at Emden nearly a fortnight ago. Have you got a build date from my Audi?
Has there been a problem with QC somewhere down the line?I am surprised as I know of others with build week 5 (last week of Jan) that were at emden waiting for UK shipping.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

"christuffleyQ5 said:This is the best bet for tracking buildhttps://www.audi.co.uk/youraudi/youraudi.htmlI am sorry to say this feature is really waste of time from my experience. I agreed to purchase a vehicle from my dealer that they had spec'd approx six weeks ago. The your Audi tracker stated that the factory was gathering the parts to make it. This was not true as i knew the vehicle was actually made and in transit. The status then changed approx 4 weeks ago to state now in transit, and has not changed since. It has said that the vehicle is on route to the U.K. This is not true as it is in the dealers compound and due to be collected on Saturday.Yesterday received an email from your Audi stating the order has been cancelled and the details of tracking then disappeared from their system. I emailed my dealer about this and then received an email from your Audi stating that the build of the car was about to start and to log on to their site. I did and the status changed to vehicle in transit. Not true as I have said collecting car Saturday.So don't hold your breath on the accuracy.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand..."

In the New Year we experienced further delays which were finally resolved when we had to place a new order for your Q5 as we were unable to modify any existing builds. As you have noted from tracking your order Audi finally accepted it on February 23[sup]rd[/sup]As you know the production has now been moved to Mexico and I can only assume that this switch created the difficulties we experiencedIt isn't a great start as you've said and can entirely understand you being unhappy and disappointedI'll give you a call later todayClick to expand...I have heard of the term ""quota"" used before regarding when dealers are allocated build slots from the manufacturer. I am surprised that the delay was this long though. I think the least the dealer should have done was to advise you earlier of the pending delay.There does appear to have been logistic issues with vehicles from Mexico, with modern technology this should not happen.

Actually it is sport trim upwards that should have LED lighting in the cupholder section (if any one can check to see if they have it that would be appreciated) I've raised this with the dealer and Audi UK.If Mexico QA have missed this... what else have they forgotten!???

Thanks Snow Man is that from the latest Q5? Yes I've double checked and definitely not there on mine.
"I've been offered a 'plug and drive' monitor from Admiral where I have to keep it in car for 3 months for them to assess if I can qualify for a renewal discount of up to 20%.Has anyone had any experience of these?

I was thinking that as I'm due the new Q very soon, it might be the best period to have this black box as I would be a bit more careful with new car to begin with?!I'm probably more concerned about if and who they can potentially share this data with.Any opinions and experience much appreciated.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"If it's a 20% discount of their renewal price I wouldn't bother. Insurance companies almost always bump up insurance premiums after year 1 for no reason, preferring to entice new customers with savings and sting loyal customers with increased premiums for no reason. I have moved my insurance every year for many years now as my insurer always wants to sting me in year 2, expecting (as I am sure many do) that I will just auto renew."
"Like mentioned before by others I never go with the same insurance company 2 years in succession,every renewal there is always 1 company who are willing to ""buy"" your business due to falling profits or something similar.No faffing about now with proof of ncd or anything as its all on a database so apart from setting up a new direct debit or payment recipient thats it really,normally take great pleasure when my existing company call me to ask why I havent renewed yet and I tell them they should of gave me a better renewal quote as they have not had to pay out for the premium they got last year.I hate car insurance companies as much as ppi companies!"

"As it happens we use similar devices to compare/record how our drivers behave, not in the UK by the way! This is not my idea, but they are rewarded for not accelerating hard, not braking hard etc. It is sold as a way to ensure they drive carefully as th roads here are very dangerous, but is also to do with cost efficiencies so that our fleet of vehicles suffer less hard driving. There may also be some incentives when it comes to insuring a large fleet of cars and drivers."
"Insurance companies can go jump, there is no way I'm having a black box in my car! Anyone can drive like an angel for 3 months... Only be interested if the reduction % was a lot more significant like +50%."
"Exactly what I mean,why do they have to be asked (and normally will) to knock it down the the lowest competitor,they did nothing for you the previous 12 months apart from take the payment from you so why cant they check who is the lowest at renewal and match/beat it?Too busy sending out stupid bloody meerkats and sponsoring sporting events with my cash!"
I've had my insurance with insure the box for 7 years. Every renewal is cheaper. And they have worked out cheaper overall. The blackbox fitted acts as a tracker and the only real setback is that I can't drive under 3rd party cover on another car. But that's minor as I don't really need to drive other people's cars. I still check anuualy on price comparison websites to see that the premiums are for my renewal but ITB beats them every year.
"Hi all, just wondering how many of you (if any at all) have had a Q5 on a PCP deal on the old model for the full term and if so what was the deal come trade in time?For me to hit my monthly figure I want to pay out, I'd have to put £4000 down as a deposit, am I likely to see any of that again or would they want another £4000 for the next one?I understand nobody can predict the future, just looking at what people have found in the past!Thanks."
"Would say official depreciation figures are your best indicator rather than anecdotal evidence from people on here, although both are subject to a lot of error!At the end of the day PCP is borrowing money, so if you pay as big a deposit as you can afford, and as much every month as you can afford - you'll pay less interest irrespective of the final outcome, which is most in most cases a good thing."

As far as I know you can't cast anything to MMI?
It's not casting as such. The Audi Smartphone Interface that is standard on the new Q5 will allow you to extended the functionality of the phone to the centre screen.https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/auto/
@Snow Man - Is it really possible to tell much of a difference between theleatherette and real leather in the twin leather arrangement given that I'd prefer a pano roof?

Finally when is / when was the price increase?
"Great photos! Usually go for Daytona Grey, but fancied a change and went for Navarra Blue.With regards to spec, consideration for me was whether I was looking to keep long term, in the end I couldn't keep it under £40K without compromising. In the end specced the sunroof and virtual cockpit regardless of road tax etc.Bizarrely my build week was 6 then moved to 4. As I check status of order, it is now in transit! Dealer says it will know take up to 12 weeks to deliver. Will keep you updated on progress."
I thought the new Q5's for Europe were still being built in Germany?
"They have completely move all production to Mexico and India (some in China too)This for me is a problem, you are paying a premium and Audi have put a large mark-up on the MK2 prices even though its much cheaper to produce. Then you have the ultra quattro which on the lower models basically mean you are FWD now..They lost my business in this drive to make customer pay for their dieselgate mess.https://www.autoevol...ris-110108.htmlhttp://www.audi.com/...ose-chiapa.html"
ah..... assuming there are going to be some teething problems regarding QA coming out of a new factory????is it just the Q5/SQ5's that are being produced from the Mexico plant?
I'm not aware of any other models being made in mexico right now.The new A5/S5 is Germany still.
"It was on the ""to consider"" list, but the release dates and changes made the Q5 a no no for me.Too much is a compromise now, engines, spec, options cost, plastic leather!!!, the ultra tech on lower models (not that id go lower) and then the huge cost uplift.Look at the good cars you can get for the same money...And its not just the Q5, but this is the vent on here. Audi have gone stupid on the pricing of cars. 60k for a TT are you trying to ******* without lube!!!! its a TT."
What did you go for in the end.
"Hi Snow Man, I thought you ordered in the end? Like everything down to personal choice and budget. Regardless as long as you are happy, that's the main thing.Agree production in Mexico was a question mark when ordering, but all MK2 Q5's will be coming out of Mexico so no choice really.With regards to alternatives, considered GLC, X3, and F-Pace but settled for Audi, worst case will change out a few years down the line."
"That's the dealers line they are using at the moment, up to 12 weeks for delivery. I'm hoping they are being conservative, however to be honest they have no idea on how long it takes from Mexico.I'm hoping they come good, delivering and getting it registered in March and driving in April (official release date) I'm sure the dealer would love it for new reg targets in March."
"I've gone back to petrol too, the TDi just didn't do it for me and the performance fell short.Plus I got bored of the faults with the BiTi engine (sticking in the manifold thing).The SQ is not going, i just decided to try a lease for a year see how it works out and then i'll look to offload the SQ.I went RS7 performance."
"The bitdi has a lot of fans, including me, if a diesel SQ doesn't appear it would probably be good for residuals."
"Went for Midnight Blue... sort of best of two worlds; Navarra and Manhattan ;-)My dealer said it might be up to 4 months to get the car, so 12 weeks sounds very appealing to meThere are 2 full leader options; milano for all trim levels and feinnappa for s-line, though you need to pay extra :-( Personally I went for alcantara... and almost everything you can pack in.... but in Poland there is no upcharge related to car price, but rather to engine size."

It's interesting how the 40k limit is going to really change buyers going forward...Enjoy.
"Most purchasers of new vehicles, change at or before 3 years. Will an extra £930 VED really have an impact on those who can afford to buy a £40,000 vehicle?"
£930? Isn't it £310 extra for the 1st five years at standard rateand£800 or £1200 (compared to whatever it is right now) extra for the first year?
"I agree, but just look at the few that have ordered Q5s they've all mentioned the 40k limit and spec'n to avoid it.People just dont like tax..https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/534511/ved-reform-briefing-for-motor-industry.pdf"

The crooks in suits are adept at finding new ways to lighten our pockets
"It doesn't make sense to me either. Why does the government make tax rules so convoluted?On re-reading that poorly written guide: It appears those who purchase a 40K+ vehicle and change it before 3rd year VED, will ""only"" be penalised by an extra £310.I was never very good at maths <LOL>"
"The way i read it is this...Assumption CO2 is 180 - so first reg is £800, then the 2nd year (for 5 years) would be standard rate of £140 + £310, so £450/year for 5 years.So it has the potential to kill the resale value of cars..."
What that document does not cover is the situation of someone buying a used car registered after April 17 that originally cost over the £40k but paid under £40k for it. Does the used car buyer have the £310 liability for the reminder of the 5 year term even though he paid less than the tax introduction figure? I for one would be really pi##ed off if that were the case.
"Yes, same as now really, who ever owns the car is responsible for paying the tax regardless of how many previous keepers it's had."
"Agree with above, DVLA will hold the tax record and will just send the bill linked to the car for the full 5 years.."
"Have to say, after much deliberation and having looked at several internal and external photos, I'm finding the new shape Q5 somewhat, drab and uninspiring. Maybe it'll grow on me but I'm 99% sure my next car will not be a Q5 and may not even be an Audi. The last 10 years of class leading styling seems to be waning, or maybe I'm just getting old!"
"When you see it in the metal you will like it... Looks better than the current version, but you will clearly be able to see the brother/sister resemblance.Audi are firmly evolutionary, not revolutionary when it comes to design."
Perhaps not ............ due to another crazy aspect of those ill conceived new rules.A £40+K car (e.g. an SQ5) registered before 31st March will continue to pay VED at the old rate and thus after 5+ years VED will be more expensive than one registered after 31st March.
"Yep its only NEW cars from now forward.But resale values will start drop (for the cars impacted), people will be unwilling to pay as those new cars get older and older."
"Financially it doesn't really make a lot of difference to the savvy second hand purchaser.For example:purchases a 4+ year old SQ5 registered before 31st March & keep it for 4+ years, VED 4 X £270 = £1080purchases a 4+ year old SQ5 registered after 31st March & keep it for 4+ years, VED 2 X £450 + 2 X £140 = £1180"
But if you keep it for 2... double the cost..
"This is what I'm hoping for, but I have my doubts whenever I look at the new Q7 in the metal.Always reminds me of some angular, boxy, 80's estate car.Maybe the Q5 won't have the same effect, due to it being shorter in length, but not holding my breath."
What happens if dealer registers and taxes a 40k+ demo and you buy it when its 2 months old?Obviously they pay the initial big penalty of first year tax and because ved is non transferable do you then pay 5 years @€310+£140?That probably will bring an end to pre reg deals and demos probably being kept for whole of 1st year by dealers possibly??
My build week was week 3 in January 2017. My 'your Audi' tracker updated on the 24th Feb to tell me it was on its way to the UK. Still no sign of my car with the dealer now saying all Q5's coming from Mexico are taken back to the original Q5 factory in Germany for further 'quality checks' before being taken back to Emden to be shipped to the UK. There is something going on that customers are not being told. Has Mexican build quality turned out not as expected ? Why further checks at the original factory in Germany ? And still the dealer cannot tell me where my car is or when it is expected in the UK. I will keep members posted of my progress - or lack of it.
Sorry to hear of the delays you are experiencing. My vehicle had a build week of week 5 (early Feb). Thankfully I took delivery of it 2 weeks ago. Not sure why there is no accurate info about where it is. My dealer was initially vague about where it was prior to collection but was eventually able to say precisely where it was. Thankfully build quality seems good and no real issues with it.Hope you motor arrives soon it is well worth the wait.
"I bought a dealer stock car that was built on 24/01, it arrived at Grimsby yesterday and the dealer's advised me it'll be with them within the next 10 days. Not heard anything untoward about mexican build quality but was told that all Q5s are QC'd in Germany after leaving Mexico and then sent on to the customer."

"Indicated mpg, and the engine is the 2.0 litre 190ps diesel."
"In date order, the DIS on the four Q5's I have owned have been optimistic by the following amounts; 3.9%, 4.1%, 5.8%, and the latest one 2.8%."
Even if the DIS is out by say 5% I don't think I will be concerned by just 2 mpg! As long I have a reasonable idea of fuel consumption that's good enough for me.
"I have the 2.0TDI on 19"" wheels and the ride is fine and if you mean caravan by your snide 'shed' remark then yes it it makes a great tow car too!"
But how do you know it's not 20% out unless you check?
I am going by the % figures quoted by you in your earlier posts as a guideline. Incidentally just filled up for the first time today and it would sugggest that that the DIS is slightly under recording the true figure by 1.255556678889 % approximately!

"Just as a data point, during my last fill-up, my DIS indicated 6.4 L/100 km while the actual consumption was 6.71 L/100 km. The DIS understated consumption by a non-trivial 4.62%.Even more importantly, the DIS's optimistic reading is not off by the same percentage each time. That's why I trust real fuel economy numbers only, and not the DIS. As far as I'm concerned, when people report indicated fuel economy, I see that as fiction."
Rounding to 11 significant figures - how inaccurate
"Not really - my calculator didn't have any more digits, otherwise I would have been a little more accurate. That's why I did say approximate."

I've also got the 2017 Q5 in Navarra blue. Its a beautiful colour and i am so glad i chose this over the Daytona Grey. Ive had it for just over a week and its lovely throughout
do you have to have the side skirt at the bottom of it in that colour?

"cruicd said:I too was unconvinced by the grey coloured sill appendages attached to the Sport model I inspected today, very obvious on a black car, and am encouraged to see that the S line vehicle is not so afflicted. If they had been aluminium as on the previous A6 Allroad I would have been more impressed but they seem to be silvery-grey plastic which i suspect will start to look scruffy when they have been exposed to road debris thrown up by the wheels. The faux exhaust trim in silvery plastic was also a bit of a retrograde step in my opinion compared to the polished stainless steel exhaust tips fitted previously. If Skoda can fit proper polished stainless steel exhaust tips to it's 4x4 Superb why is Audi hiding the exhaust under the car and putting unconvincing bits of exhaust shaped plastic on the valance?Looking @ the S-Line photo it looks as though the the rear valance panel flares out as on the mark 1 & 1.5 model so wondering if someone @ Milton Keynes has given consideration to supplying S-Line compatible mud flaps this time around. Difficult to see if the side skirt will affect front flap fitment and the salesman I met today was very honest stating that he had no idea mud flaps were even available for any Q5 model.Overall I like the car but one other thing, apart from the stick on information screen, that let it down inside was the hard plastic door pull which felt cheap compared the stitched leather covering on my car and the padded soft touch plastic of A4 & A6s I have owned before. The salesman thought that S line models might softer trim on the door pull but did not have a vehicle on site to look at to confirm this.We discussed the new Road Fund Licence fee for vehicles > £40k but I guess one just swallows this if one likes the car unless you can do without leather & metallic paint.Click to expand...I have the SLINE.

I have a 2 Q5 s line plus that will be 3 years old in July and am looking to change for a new one.However the dealer I did the deal through has come back with a very low value for my car- this month it is just over the GFV for July set 3 years ago but they are suggesting no new car until September it will then be under GFV.How is this possible when the whole purpose of PCP is you have some residual to put down as a deposit ( it is under mileage and in immaculate condition) and the value they have give in around 5 K under the same spec cars they are selling on the audi website currently.?It is one affected by the emissions fiasco so I wondered if this is why and is there anyone else who has had this and been able to secure a higher value?Its the first time doing PCP and they positioned it at sale time that you wouldn't definitely have a higher value than the GFV when changing over or I would not have gone with PCP.Any advice welcome?
"I'd be extremely peed off as well, If you've met with the terms re condition/mileage of the car etc how can they renege on the original deal? Guaranteed future value should mean what it says, current market value shouldn't come into it?"
"Sorry but I really don't see that. Because of our original estimated higher mileage we had to pay a substantial deposit (£4k) and then higher monthly payments (£306 pm); at the end of 3 years we came in substantially under mileage and with a car in better overall condition than estimated at the start, and are then told sorry despite paying out oodles of cash up front and in the intervening 36 months your car isn't worth as much as we said would be aminimumfuture value. Absolute con."
surely a lower GFV is better when you trade it in and the car is worth more than they reckon and you come away with more equity to use as a deposit for a new one?that's what i did last time - low GFV - car was worth a lot more after 3yrs - used the equity to buy new Q5.if it was worth less than GFV i would have no equity and no new Q5.

"All depends on the change/option added/removed, but its never a new order. You will have the same order number on SLiSome options are on delayed release and if you selected one of those then it causes a replan at the factory and a new BW.Remember the dealer can not influence the build date and removing the change made is no guarantee you will get moved forward either...A tip from me would be: you can ""ask"" the dealer to simulate a change and look what the impact will be before you do anything..."
"Thanks Snow Man, that's good to know. Fingers crossed it will be good news."
"Good news, build has been confirmed for 23rd Jan now!"
"Hi Snow Man, just wondering how you can see the estimated delivery date (10th March?)Thanks in advance."
"My build date has now gone back to w/c 3rd April.The dealer had given me a price on my car assuming March delivery and I had specced the new one to meet my budget based on that p/x price. If they cannot honour that price then the deal may be off.Still, it's not as though I am slumming it in my current car so it won't be a disaster."
"I very much doubt they will try to change deal financially, based on their own delivery dates changing"
When I placed the order in November they anticipated a delivery in March so we are now talking a three month shift to that date based on anticipated transit times post build.
"Oh I thought it was only a month difference.Anyway, I still don't believe they will change the deal you've signed up for, even though your own car is probably depreciating £4-500 per month."
"Tax is separate, they do have something in the Ts and Cs about it...I cant see Audi paying it - they will keep the car price, but the OTR will change. (is my guess)."
"The dealer had thought only one month for delivery post build not three.I spoke to him today and he confirmed that it is still build week 7 (some confusion as they placed an order for me in advance of me confirming the spec I wanted) and they think three months for delivery is ""very much the worst case"". Still, at least he knows my position."
"They will do that with the price of the car, but normally you will see a comment in the T&Cs around on road costs or VAT..You need to check with your dealer ""if"" the cost is over 40k as that will add too.Basic diesel now is about £165, vs £200, then the uplift for £40k+ is another £310 on top"
Ouch!
"Having purchased several new Audis, I have never been asked for a deposit.Many dealers will absorb minor cost variations. I would be very surprised if any will swallow an extra £310 VED, when a £40+ car delivery goes from pre to post VED increase."
"Depends on the car re deposit in my experience. I did have to pay deposits for the R8s, dealer wasn't bothered with the SQ.Also think it makes a difference on how you intend to pay for the car too."
Just had a message from the dealer - the car is being built next week.

"I always pay cash... Not wanting a spat, but i would perhaps say it could be a colour issue; to make sure they were not left with it.For a big car, red is an unusual choice - not that I'm saying i don't like..!"
"Hello, just answering the delivery question for you, car which I ordered and was built a few weeks and left the factory is still in transit to the exit port (2 weeks ago) once it actually departs Mexico I've been told anywhere between 5-9 weeks.To be honest 3 weeks sounds optimistic."
"rrollins said:I went ahead on 7 Feb and ordered an Audi Q5 SE 2.0 TDI quattro S tronic in Monsoon Grey yesterday with the following options to keep under £40k for road tax reasons, allocated build week 15 with dealertold 21 days delivery from end of build week and being cautious at the initial expectation of end of May delivery.As new to Audi, does this sound entirely sensible and given the car's coming form Mexico?Also is theHill hold assist operated via a switch or can it be disabled via the MMI?Met paintPano roofPrivacy glassElectrically folding door mirrorsHill hold assistClick to expand...Unless I have done it wrong, that configuration comes to £40,515 OTR - perhaps somebody could check. Unfortunately I have been told that VED is based on the OTR price. I just couldn't see how any option could come under the magic number with a pano roof, hence why I checked. Happy to be proven wrong though."
"My mistake - I had nav selected. Removing it brings the OTR price down to £39,965."
Phew - hate paying tax!If there's anyone from Audi product management/pricing looking at these forums then you should definately look at a <£40K price point that includes nav and other essentials.
I agree Audi have really maxed out their margins. Headlight washers they even charge for now (used to be pretty much standard on certain trim I think)The free roof bars with the old Q5 are no longer included. So another £185 I need to spend.
"They are required by law on Xenons, LEDs are even brighter so wouldn't have thought they would be exempt?"
"That's interesting, we've just ordered a new A3 with Xenons (standard) and it comes without headlight washers (a £250 extra) .............."
"Hmm, maybe I'm wrong, I thought Xenons were required to be self levelling with a wash facility, something to do with dirty lights affecting the beam pattern and causing dazzle - not that the washers ever actually clean the lights mind you, all they're good for is emptying the skoosher bottle and messing up the bonnet."
If the new one doesn't have them - no problem.
"Just checked yourAudi login etc, official launch date is 14th March."
HiI ordered mine (build week 5). S-Line Navarra Blue.Its apparently left mexico and is en route to Germany. My dealer is saying April arrival but im a little dubious based on what ive read. Watch this space I guess
"Hello, it might be on the same ship as mine build week 4 which is great news. Dealer has told me it's on a ship and should be making its way to Germany.Not sure if you have registered but youraudi is ok in terms of where your car is, you'll see map of ports that the car needs to get to before hitting the UK. Unfortunately you can't get any more detail etc (which ship, where it is etc)Thanks"
"Just wondering has anyone placed an order yet for a new one ?I intended to place an order last weekend but i simply can not settle on a colour i really really like !! colour choice is poor to say the least.I know the screen position isn't going to change but everytime i look at the other models with the same set up i just think it looks ugly and very mercedes and puts me off.Why on earth would they just plonk it in front of the dash in a premium vehicle , the q7 setup is miles better.The dealer reckons currently im looking at a june delivery if i dont want a stock car.Looks like June for me then if i can pick a colour ...I cantr bring myself to opt for a stock car as i load them up to the max and the stock ones are very basic.Gone are the days when you could change your colour or alter your order weeks later :-("
"Mine is still showing ""In quality control"". It's been there for a week so I hope they haven't found too many things that need rectification :-(It might just be waiting for the next boat of course!"
They are obviously taking extra special care for an extra special client
LOL
Or knocking the dents out..I really worry about Audis quality standards.
Thanks Snow Man :-(
Mines (not Q5) stuck in QC too. 2 weeks upto now..
"UPDATE : I have heard from CS that mine left for Germany on the 27th February. I have a friend in VW who kindly sent me the shipping vessel details and it seems like mine is on ""Splendid Ace"" and is due to Emden on Saturday Morning 11th March. Dealer anticipates 2-3 weeks to dealership...Out of curiosity, did anyone that's bought an S-Line opt for the 20"" S Segment w/grey wheels or did you stick with the 19"" 5 spoke star standard? I've stayed with the 19""'s but as usual doubting myself......"
"That's great news! Fingers crossed they get it to you before April 1st. If you don't mind me asking what build week was your car? I have no idea where my car is at the moment, only thing I know it's on a boat somewhere."
"Update to question, I've stuck with 19"", also I'm on either one of two ships, due at Emden 17-20th March."
I was build week 5- do you know which ships you are on?
"Hello, I've just double checked with them and it's on the same ship as yours. It can be tracked herehttps://www.marinetraffic.com/If the above is the case I wished they expedite the shipping from Emden to UK so could get it before April 1st (in my dreams)"
That's a fascinating link!
"Sorry to hear that Skiman, sounds like a terrible experience. Not what you want when you spend that sum of money!It wouldn't surprise me if your sales guy didn't do the necessary admin on your order, hence why someone else might have been able to order the car? I would be expecting the dealer to pull out all the stops to make up for it!"
"Once sold it cant be resold (by mistake)...The dealer allocates a customer to the commission number once a sales agreed (done by the dealerships sales office) so its visible to all UK dealerships.Lots of issues with Audis systems right now it would seem, so it could well have been showing incorrect info as he said.Unless you had been given the commission number, kinda hard to tell."
"I don't think I'll ever get to the bottom of what really happened. I just cannot understand how the info initially provided could be so wide of the mark. ""The car is sitting in the compound"" to being told ""er well it's some where in transit between Mexico and the UK"". If it wasn't for me pushing the issue the dealer I don't think would have made the effort to track the car down."
The dealer did say that tracking the cars from Mexico had been more difficult than other models. Perhaps he is right I don't really know.
I had the same line from my salesman (couldn't be bothered to investigate) I rang CS and they checked with Audi UK who found out the ship.I'm pretty sure they know which boat it's on. It's not exactly a small purchase and I'm pretty sure Audi wouldn't lose a boat load of stock.
"Just wondering has anyone placed an order yet for a new one ?I intended to place an order last weekend but i simply can not settle on a colour i really really like !! colour choice is poor to say the least.I know the screen position isn't going to change but everytime i look at the other models with the same set up i just think it looks ugly and very mercedes and puts me off.Why on earth would they just plonk it in front of the dash in a premium vehicle , the q7 setup is miles better.The dealer reckons currently im looking at a june delivery if i dont want a stock car.Looks like June for me then if i can pick a colour ...I cantr bring myself to opt for a stock car as i load them up to the max and the stock ones are very basic.Gone are the days when you could change your colour or alter your order weeks later :-("
"I agree, I think part of the problem is now the size of dealerships. The personalized service side of things seems to have disappareared. I feel very much like you are now just a number which is a pity. Years ago when I had Land Rovers I could go in to the showroom the sales and service staff knew who I was. I remember once walking down my local high street and bumped in to one of the service advisors. He rembered that I had some warranty work carried out six months earlier (and what it was) and asked if the fix was still working. That would never happen now."
Just picked up the new shape with virtual dash and b and o sound system too.....fantastic in Daytona grey
"Are Audi oblidged to give a copy of service history,as its no longer stamped in service book."
If asked I'm sure they would provide details
"I recently asked my local dealer about this very thing and they kindly supplied all of the information relating to my car, via email, within day."
I see next weeks auto express mag (out Wed 15.3) will see the new Q5 go head to head against the Jag F- Pace and Merc GLC. It will be interesting to see how it gets on.
"And the new porcshe,Volvo in the real world . I couldn't see past another Q5 but after looking at the new one and the spec I think I will check out the comption first."
"It's good that there is so much choice. It's a pity that the price of these motors are getting more and more expensive, that is before you even factor in additional ved costs for vehicles over £40k. I would love a SQ5 but the cost of a decent spec one is crazy. Thankfully we have a TT Roadster to enjoy a little bit of fun/performance. Your spec SQ5 sounds fantastic and I bet it is great fun to own. I shudder to think how a 2017 version of your SQ5 would cost.When the Mercedes GLC was launched I was very tempted, if the Merc dealer had not been so greedy I probably would have been driving one. Now that I have seen a new Q5 and indeed ordered one the Merc dealer has done me a favour."
Just wait for brexit and the foreign car tax...Hopefully people like JLR will continue to make good cars UK..
"Auto Express is a bit of a comic IMO, better to wait until Car get their hands on one and do a more thorough assessment."
"I spec'ed one up on the 2017 model it's £62,300."
Still will be nice to see them together and have a third party make a comparison.
"blimey, if I suggested paying this much for a Q5 my wife would divorce me!"
"I prefer the look of the Mercedes GLC SUV (there's also a coupe, which I don't care for) over the new Q5. Unfortunately, the GLC diesel failed emissions certification tests and won't be coming to North America."
Liking the look of teh new Volvo - but like the Q5 it's impossible to spec the petrol one properly under 40k.
Yup we are paying for the emissions scandal.
I actually ordered a Mercedes GLC to be delivered before end of March to beat VED increase. Dealer then phoned couldn't be supplied now till June due to supply issues but expected me to accept the order for a car not to my spec. He was perturbed when I said I don't think so. Plus the crabbing issue not to mention now the fire issue has shafted the order.Mercedes now issued a public statement and accepted issues at last. Order cancelled...Like the new Q5 but it seems a little safe...
"Its not just the Q5, look at the price of other models.40k for a TT, 60k for a top of the range RS is beyond laughable for a nose heavy bland and frankly boring car. Grant it has 0-60 on its side, but id rather go slower and have some fun driving, isn't that what a car is meant to do - be fun?"
"Yeah, just part of Audi's ""going more upscale"" strategy, which started (I believe) in the planning states years before Dieselgate blew."
It's not just Audi it's all VW Group price hike.
http://www.autoexpre...pid=72760252956Mmmmmm?
"For me, F-Pace felt too big, GLC boot was too small. Depends on your requirements more than anything."
I see next weeks auto express mag (out Wed 15.3) will see the new Q5 go head to head against the Jag F- Pace and Merc GLC. It will be interesting to see how it gets on.
Mat Watsons' Q5 review for Carwow. I really like his light hearted but honest reviews and he's done loads for Carwow.https://www.youtube....h?v=dT-Px_eb2jQ
The 12v socket is behind the net on the right.
"Wow, just seen some of the reply's on the DailyTelegraph's Honest John site re GLC's crabbing. MB advising owners that its a ""characteristic"" and nothing they can do, and recommend you go out and buy winter tyres as the solution not good !"
They even have their own Crabbing Web site:www.mercedescrabbing.org
"I understand the crabbing is caused by the steering geometry, see herehttp://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?t=1267361I was shocked when I first experienced it and amazed that Porsche failed to take recognise the fundamental principle >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_steering_geometryApparently the Porsche geometry helps reduce tyre temperatures during high-speed cornering but compromises performance in low-speed manoeuvres."
"Just go tohttp://autotrader.co.ukand take your pick,use the filters to get your price, colour, spec etc etc.Your timing is good, there's some SQ5 bargains out there."
Should be doable.I can say from experience the trade in value for our 63 reg is 28.5k

"Hi,Me again. So how important is the Audi Drive select option? Is it really worth having if I'm on the lookout for an SQ5? Lots of cars don't seem to have it. Especially ones that tick a lot of other boxes. Any advice please?Any other must have options?Cheers, DJM"
Don't worry about the lack of Audi Drive Select. I had it enabled in the mmi through vcds by my local audi independent expert. It took about 10 minutes with a laptop and cost me just a few quid. Worth it for the lovely growl from the exhaust in 'dynamic' mode.
"Fotgot to add, desirable options:Privacy glassB & O soundPowered tailgate21"" alloysSat nav and adaptive cruise.Hope this helps."
"Thanks for this. Just wondering how they code it because all the photos I've seen show a button that I presume you need to press? It says 'drive select' on it. Does that make sense?What is 'Audi Concert'? Is that better than the B&O system? I've seen a car online which has it although the central dash area (where the radio, gear stick etc are) looks to be a different layout to other models. Is one better than the other? This was on a June 14 plate car if that helps?Cheers"
"Desirable options are subjective at best lets say.B&O is not really any different to the standard option. You can view that one of two ways, standard is good, B&O in Q not so good.Are you sure its concert and not connect? Audi uses Symphony in the Q.The Nav is the only option to add value, but its old/dated by audi standards.Carbon inlays would be high on the list.Parking system advance with the camera maybe"

Although I'm surprised that the B&O isn't a noticeable difference. Going from standard in my last BMW to HK was a vast improvement.I like the Carbon inlays. Not keen on the Aluminium effect but lots of cars seem to have it. Can they be taken off and wrapped or sprayed easily do you know? Still torn on the nav - it looks dated to me and the screen is uber tiny! Do people actually use it or do they hook up their iPhones instead?"
"I would agree about the nav. Yes by current standards it may be a little dated but imho it works really well and has helped me avoid some major hold ups. Re the ads, from the factory there is an ads button on the dash but if you have it enabled as I did then its easily accessed through the mmi control. Not heard the standard sound system but I do like the quality and depth of sound from the b & o system. Wouldnt fancy attempting to wrap/spray the inlays - better to buy one (they are plentiful) with your choice of inlays."
"Thanks again for your reply. I will keep looking.I just spoke to an audi dealer in wolverhampton but the car didn't have sat nav. He said he could fit it for £1500.00! No thanks.He asked how I wanted to pay for it and as soon as I said cash he changed completely and said 'Oh OK then, bye'. Is that normal? Do they not like cash buyers any more? It's funny because I will be getting a loan although I don't want to pay nearly 11% when I can get one for around 3%."
"http://www.autotrade...rice-asc&page=2There's about 16 on Autotrader at £30K or less, this one's only done 25k, got 21s, BnO, power tailgate and sidesteps. No mention of satnav but many of the others do."
"Audi sat nav is very poor, I hardly ever use mine. You would be better with a Tom Tom."
I was thinking that too. Or my iPhone I guess. Does anyone else think the same or use their phone instead.I thought I read somewhere that if you don't have sat nav then it affects the options in ADS. Is that correct?
"If you expand the search on Autotrader to £35K there are 69 to choose from, sure to be one that meets your needs in there somewhere, you can then haggle the price down towards 30, it's a buyers market apparently.FWIW I would definitely go for 21s, BnO, nav, rear camera as must haves, anything else is in the nice to have category."
That is not correct.
ADS is real simple to add including the button - I think it was about 20mins of effort.This is it's pretty pointless so no huge loss with or without it. It would be the bottom of the want list for sure along with rear camera and b&o
"Each to their own I guess but I really rate the B&O and love the ease of having built in satnav. I can't say I've had any issues with mine. Apart from which, the amp in the head unit is definitely better with satnav rather than without, speaking from experience."
Thanks for the replies again guys. Quite a few cars come up for around £34k but I cant see Audi reducing them to £30k. I know it's only a few grand more but I really don't want to go over £30k.Do people know what kind of discount percentage I should get on a used? Will it be affected if I don't go for finance with them? The sales guy earlier was very disappointed (rude actually) when I said no to finance!
They will get kick backs for you taking the finance so you can normally get a better deal by taking the finance. It's more expensive but look into the early repayment so you could buy with Audi finance which is very finance then get your loan to wipe the dealer finance?
But the B&O system isn't about base it's about overall sound quality.
"Hi,Can you get finance through a dealer and then pay it off without penalty then? I presume I then just pay the price I negotiated via the finance deal?That sounds too easy??? Surely everyone does that?"
"Bass is sound,So depends on your taste in sound.. Had and lived with both for 7 years, on the MK1 i wouldnt pay for it. The best thing is the better looking door covers. Feel free to compare and contrast."
Never tried but it's just a loan at the end of the day. You will be charged interest for the first month but should be able to pay off at any time. it might be worth a call to vw financial services and tell them your considering buying a car on finance and looking to pay it off within a few months when (make some storey up about selling other car etc) your cash comes through
"Personally I always try to get a low miler, having said that if it's been properly serviced and looked after it should be good for a lot more than 70K."
Normally id be low mileage.But the with SQ and the engine issues I'm thinking a middle of the roader followed by a high mileage model would be better than a low mileage example.
So you can tweak the individual settings in MMI only if you have sat nav.Would you want that option?Have you seen a Q5 with ADS and without sat nav?
"Not sure if I want or in fact need ADS hence why I'm asking on here. And yes, I've seen a few SQ5's with ADS but no nav..."
"No you don't need NAV to set individual with ADS.Remember however, ADS functions or options that are controllable are linked to fitted options."
"Does anyone use good quality locking nuts for their alloys? I'm never convinced that factory ones will present enough of a challenge to a hardcore chav, so wondered if anyone uses aftermarket ones like McGard to keep them on their toes?"
do wheels still get stolen these days?
"I don't know, am I stuck in the 90s? ????"
"Last time I checked and might be wrong, but side steps are not stainless steel. I personally would use a general APC (All Purpose Cleaner) from a good detailing company such as Chemical Guys, Megiuars etc. Or a diluted down version of TFR and a soft bristle brush to agitate."
13 plate Q5 went into Harrogate Audi for service and emissions work last week. I was sent an Audi cam and a proposed £1800 bill for corrosion to the bolts that hold the exhaust underneath the car.It's was vague and the service guy unsurprisingly hasn't come back to me as promised.Is this a known issue? Only done 46k.Gut feel is they were trying it on?
"Yes, sounds like BS."
The exhaust wouldnt run to a bill that large... While the number may or may not be right id ask for a clearer explanation of those costs..
I'd get a custom one for that price.
"Just had message flash up advising topping up of Ad Blue within the next 1500 miles - with @ 12k miles currently on the clock.Dealership is suggesting a 10 litre top up would be prudent for which they are looking to charge about £20.Mixed messages on this forum - some seem to be getting refills for free, others having to pay for it.What's the score generally?"
"Even if you get it for free you may still have to wait while they fill it. OK, it may be a quick job, but I was waiting over 90 minutes the first time I had it done (plus the distance and time to get to the garage and back). I have bought a 10litre container and one of the filling nozzles to do it myself in future. I think I paid £15 for the AdBlue and a few quid for the nozzle."
A new petrol station has just opened up beside where I live. It actually has a Ad Blue pump attached to one of the main fuel pumps. Not sure how it works though.
"Warning first happened at 6,600 miles and it was fully topped up with 15 litres at 7,100 miles. I have now done 14,500 miles with no further warning so I suspect it wasn't full when collected."
"Halfords sell it in 4 & 10 litre containers with filling nozzle.It meets all the specified requirements, why bother going to and waiting at Audi service dept.!0 litres is £15, 4 litres is £12....so it's pretty obvious which to go for."
Mrs took her company car (A4 to the stealers and the cost was obscene for what they actually did) £33 I think.
Both my local dealers only charge about £10-£11 for 10 litres??
"Update:Dashboard warning dipped from 1500 miles of Adblue left to showing 1200 miles. Wanting to avoid a 2 hour round trip to the dealership, have just bought 10 litres locally for £13 (included a pouring nozzle).Took 5 minutes to fill up (vehicle swallowed about 7 litres) so remainder of the container is back in the garage ready for top ups as needed.Job done."
"Agreed - Adblue message warning indicator went from 1500 miles to 1200 ... after 35 actual driven miles.I've also just readthis:http://www.distribution365.co.uk/pages.php?page=how_to_refill_adblue_audi_Q5So...23 litre capacity should roughly last for 9000 miles. Car is currently at 12k miles from new, adblue container is 10 litres...I used 7 litres.All a bit inconsistent / confusing."
"Went for a Test Drive @ Watford Audi this morning and was really impressed.One thing I did notice that I hadn't seen was that the S Line doesn't have fog lights anymore. This is a new one on me but when I drove home and saw the newer Audis with LEDs, I noticed the same. All weather LEDs according to the salesman.Other than that, I loved the new interior, it's a real step up.Saw 3 different colours there: the blue, black and Daytona. Out of those I liked Daytona the most but have it on my current Q5. Saw a few photos of the silver that I've ordered at the Q5 launch in Hastings and pleased I picked that particular colour.Ride was exceptionally smooth IMO but it had 19 inch wheels rather than the 20's I'm running. Shame they only had diesels to drive ????????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Audi started the move away from fog lights with the TT and LED lights. (LED lights had been on the sporty audis for a while before the TT)I like it better. The car simply looks cleaner and better, plus it's more sporty.However, the great thing about fog lights is you can see the dick heads coming as they always drive with fog lights turned on.(key's in the name!)."
"Have just read the auto express comparison test on the new Q5, encouragingly the new model has higher residual values over the Merc GLC & Jag F.Pace."
"Well, interesting and encouraging,But just how the heck do they work that one out, when there aren't any used new model Q5's around yet ?Or even any new new models come to that !"
"I agree, from my experience dealers seem to throw away the value guide book when you come to part exchange. Last year when we were trying to get a deal on p/e my wife's immaculate low mileage full service TT for another, one Audi dealer offered us £2k less than we buy anycar.com. So I take this info with a pinch of salt. Again my experience dealers will try and give you as little as they think you will accept.I can almost image my conversation when I come to part exchange my 2017 Q5 in three years time, it will go something like "" I know it's £3k less than book but we just cannot get rid of diesels anymore if it had been a petrol version then we could have offered more"""
"its alway been that way - wrong colour, wheels, facelift, mileage, leather, satnav, tyres will need changing... the list is endless.They focus on a negative to reduce your expectations."
"True, at least I am going to have three years ownership without worrying about how little my car is going to be worth at time of p/e. I will cross that bridge when I come to it."
"Well yeah, but that applies to all cars, so we're going a bit off topic,I'm just wondering how they work out (supposedly) that the new Q5 has better residuals than equivalent Jags & Mercs.I say they simply 'can't yet ' with any accuracy"
"Hi all,I am new to the forum and am thinking of purchasing my first ever Audi, an SQ5 Plus Special Edition.I have been doing some research and have been offered a brand new model for £47,300. Quite a decent discount off the £53,500.Does this seem like a good deal to everyone?My only worry is that the new Q5 model and SQ5 are due out this year and if we did a 2 or 3 year lease, would this SQ5 Plus SE lose a large amount of value in those years? All up for debate I know, but as this is my first serious car purchase, I wanted to gather opinions from the experts on here.Looking at Mythos Black, Lava Grey and Moonlight Blue. I think the grey or the blue suits the styling best.Any info or opinions greatly received.Many thanks!"
"Look at what the FGV they are offering, that's your guide/safety net.It's going to lose more now as its end of life, but look at the discount you are getting too."
"Ok thanks.Final payment / FGV is £28,800.To me it doesnt look all that different. Only thing I would be missing out on would be the interior tech spec I think. Other than that, I think I prefer the older model style"
"Wow that does look stunning! Really liking the grey. Always thought I wanted black, but thats so nice.Delivery mid March apparently for the last of the old SQ5 Plus SE models"
"Thanks all for the info. I will try and test drive one this weekend and see what I think.Aside from all the gadgets that the Plus SE comes with, is there anything else that people deem essential?Am I right in thinking theres no USB socket?"
"You have a connection in the glovebox for the MMI, So, yes you can use USB.Audi UK have some unsold cars ready to go. There was a few Lava and blacks, i don't recall blue on the list when i looked..."
Ok thanks again
Ok its done and orderedDelivery in March! Got a good deal I think and one of the last few in stock available to the dealer.Now I have to wait ... annoying!Thanks to all for your assistance.
Congrats - what colour and spec did you opt for?PS have they guaranteed pre April delivery?
"Thank you. I had to go with what they had in stock as no customizing available.So its lava grey Special Edition, with red brake calipers and gloss black alloys. They were only specifications, everything else is standard.The invoice said estimated 30th March. Asked the dealer and she said she can't get any more clarity at the moment but that it could be sooner than that."
"I would wait for the new one, its too close now not to look at it - registration has opened."
"That'll look good, so long as it's registered before 1/4!"
Thanks
"Hi Snow Man, if registration has opened does that mean Audi UK has announced pricing?"

"Thanks Ransman, however it was SQ5 pricing I was hoping had been released"
There's an AMI socket in the glovebox. Make sure they give you the right cable for your phone and get a usb one as well - at least!ALA are good for GAP and are open to negotiation on price so it's worth phoning instead of just signing up online.
"Ok great thanks very much. Got a Samsung Galaxy S6, so hopefully they'll have that."
Collected my new Q5 S Line 2.0 TDI today and I must say I'm delighted!My only question is do I extent the standard 3 year Audi warranty?One year £649Two years £999Three years £1349I would be interested in people's opinions.
"If you know you're going to have it beyond the 3 years, then without a doubt IMO ????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
what's the best option to extend for the 4th year if you are already 2 years into owning it?
Audi will contact you prior to expiry.Look back over your ownership of vehicles to see if extended warranty would have saved you money. It would not have been a good deal for me.
"Anyone had experience or used alloy gator wheel protectors, or is any wider tyres that will save kerbing alloys."
"My Pirelli 21"" have a good chunk of rubber as a rim protector."
maybe try them.
"Yeah i bought the black ones a couple of years ago when i refurbed my alloys and they held up pretty well and do protect until i tried a new car wash place and they used some kind of acidic cleaner which stripped the colour off them. Irritatingly not a complete strip, just swathes of it. They looked pretty ugly after that and within a few weeks i just got Audi to take them off when i had a service....I've never kerbed the alloys since."

F-pace without a question.Tiguan is shocking.. VW must have paid to get that thing on the list.
"All a matter of personal taste, F-Pace is not pretty and interior plastics are awful compared to any Audi. I agree the Tiguan is not great but interior plastics at least as good as the Jag."
"I was talking to the guys in Stevens Creek begin of feb, near Santana Row and they were saying cars were selling well.I didn't ask about discounts as i only spend 1 week/month in the valley and i dont have a house there anymore."
"Hi All,Does anyone the exact spec of the brakes on the SQ5?I'm guessing the front are 4 pots, & maybe Brembo. And the rears are maybe carryover Audi brakes from various models.All help much appreciated.Rappy"
"2 Inboard pistons push, outside is drawn. Audi are not good at S brakes..!So distribution of force is not good."
"Thanks guys.They look pretty impressive, but not over impressed with there stopping power.Rappy."
aGREEDAgreed Rappy they are nothing special.
"Brembo offer a 380 x34mm front upgrade with 6 piston calipers, this retails for £3608.00 + VAT."
"I'm sure they do, but...!"
but what..
but the price... 3600 buts there..
And a bit chavy...
Just swap to the 390mm RS6 set up if you want a better front set up. Can pick it up for about £2k or there is also the S7 set up can be picked up for similar money.
who is going to be selling these? breakers/ebay etc? are they a straight swap?
"yes, they come up regularly on ebay and forums etc, S7 set is a direct swap, RS6 requires minor mods I believe.The 390mm RS6 set up is the brake of choice on modified mk5/6/7 Golf's and A/S/RS3's"
ok thanks..theres a set of rs6 2014 front calipers on ebay...do you know anyone who could tell me exactly what mods are needed for them to fit please?
I will ask about
I believe ot requires 2mm to be shaved off the caliper carrier as the RS6 hub is a different offset to the SQ5.Other option is the S6/7/8 6 piston caliper and 400mm rotor (this is the same caliper shell as used for the ceramic option just with different pistons)
"thx Ian..maybe easier if i decide to get some to get the brembo ones for this model...im getting my sq5 stage 2 on thurs ...dpf removal,de cat, egr disable,uprated wagner intercooler and st2 mapping...only concern is im at 790nm on a map only and a big increase may put transmission under strain...i also live north east and getting work done local."
Are Bosch aerotwin wiper blades best for sq5 what size is needed?Thanks
I think so. The set you need isA298S
Thanks
Cheers.
Mine are less than a year old and seem rubbish.Sometimes wonder if someone's done a swap on me in Tesco carpark
Funny I think same.
What rain repellent do you use?
"I have a whole bunch from Aquapel (from USA) to Gyeon which I'm currently using. Where as RainX is not very effective, doesn't last that long and makes a mess of your windscreen afterwards."
"Mine are also as good as new, I've just never been impressed since first using them.You don't use them as often as most people? how do you managethat???"
"Have no issues with my front wipers, but the rear one is awful - it doesn't seem to apply pressure to the full length of the blade, so the top of the rear window never gets 'wiped'. Inspecting the blade reveals no damage. Anyone else have that issue?"
"Yes, back and front though, often leaves streaky patches right in front of my eyes."
"yes, it does seem speed related though i.e. some speeds/conditions OK, others like yo describe ...................."
Don't have any issues front or back.
Afternoon fivers.AdBlue light advice message came up the other day stating fill it up in 1200 miles then the next start the Service is Due in 500 miles also came on.....wasnt expecting it as the car is only 6 months old and has only done 9k miles.Just wondering when everyone else has had their first service on their SQ5.Seems a little bit early to be honest..........
"That does seem strange, perhaps dealer miss set the service interval?"
"Hmmmm, will call the dealer in the morrow and ask the question then....."
"Depends - is the car now 12months old since registered, was it sat around before you bought it?"
"The 1st service interval is pre-set on the mmi at either 1 year/9,000 miles or 2 years/18,000 miles.My service manager told me it was totally un-necessary at 9000 miles and simply reset it to the 18,000 miles option.I never had a problem and the oil display always read 100% during those 18,000 miles.this was on my first 2.0l TDI, but can't see it should be any different for the 3.0l"
Same here took my car in to get serviced and the servicing manager told me that the schedule fromm factory is set to 12 months and should be changed during the pre delivery inspection. In most cases it's overseen so they get cars come in for a service that have done low mileage which only need a quick service reset. 18k miles or 2 years is the rule for servicing
My firs service came up as due next week which is at 23 months old and 14500 miles. I drive it hard occassionally but not crazy.
"I've had mine come up at 11k (18 months old), just saying it needs an oil change. Is this really necessary at this mileage? or should i wait another 6 months/more mileage?Bexley Audi quoted £240 for oil change - does this sound about right?"
Yeh sounds about right. Audi do a price match service so if you find a cheaper price from a VAT registered garage that will quote you cheaper and quote using genuin audi parts and oils then they will match the price. Hope that helps.
"Audi is pretty clear on the servicing,if you do <=10k/year you should be on annual servicing, if you are over that, then variable servicing.https://www.audi.co.uk/owners-area/servicing-maintenance-mot/servicing-your-audi.html"
"Spoke to the dealership this week and he agreed that it was set wrong - cant remember if set to variable or not but after he started on the path of ""all audis are....."" I cut the young lad off and explained this was my 3rd Audi, and his dealership had serviced all of them to date.......oh yes Sir, please bring in the car and we will switch it over to the correct setting!Happy days. Might even get a top up of the Ad Blu while Im there too!"
"Or just re-set it yourself on the MMI, very simple to do."
"I had mine adjusted to 19k intervals or two years.Got quoted something silly like £465 from audi for first service but they have price matched an independent garage for £145!Am i correct it is a full inspection, oil change and pollen filter?"
"Yep that sounds about right. I've been quoted £424 for that from Bexley Audi - trying to get an independent garage to price it up, but Audi are saying they need to state part numbers etc etcIf you don't have it done, does it affect any warranty claims?"
Although I would be surprised if the garage is doing the full inspection included in the £145.
"Quotation includes full vehicle inspection, they provided me a full part list quote and copy of full inspection they carry out.Audi have price matched"
"I believe, pollen filter would be an optional extra."
"I just had Audi price match at £145 for an oil change, pollen filter and inspection"
Afternoon fivers.AdBlue light advice message came up the other day stating fill it up in 1200 miles then the next start the Service is Due in 500 miles also came on.....wasnt expecting it as the car is only 6 months old and has only done 9k miles.Just wondering when everyone else has had their first service on their SQ5.Seems a little bit early to be honest..........
"what did they do on the 'inspection' part of it?seems odd they would match at this price, when a standalone inspection is around £220...... how did you get the comparison quote to detail out what they would do on the inspection so Audi can see it's a like for like?"
"The full audi Inspection and health check was provided.It includes a scan, service interval reset and some other gubbings, its basically an overpriced glance at the car.The third party have me their inspection document which was almost identical to Audis which i used as an example"
My oil change is due in 2000 miles and the first service in 5000 do you think I should ask to get it all done at the same time.
I would
"I just had my first Oil change at 7101 as MMI told me it was due, I paid East Kent Audi £217.48 for this. First Inspection which I was told is in 305 days will cost me around £420.I think service plan is on the cards"
Hi Baron02 - that £420 cost is definitely not just a First Inspection - that will include the oil change (similar'ish price from Bexley Audi and roughly in the same regional area so wouldn't have thought the cost fluctuation would matter). I would definitely question that with them? - i phoned up several times and told slightly different things each time - very frustrating!
"That's a big difference to me my first oil change will be around 15,000 and the first service 3,000 later. Different engine mind you."
"Had the first service done £435 with oil change,pollen filter and two punchers repaired ."

Got a merc GLE350d as a hire car while the SQ is being repaired and it has merc logo puddle lights from door mirrors looks cool apart from it being a merc and now has me wondering how I can fit to the SQ. I've seen the door puddle lights with various logos but not seen them for the door mirrors? Anyone seen them for sale?
yeah seen them a few times and from memory they are a dealer fit from Audi.
Still can't find them but can find the projector led so maybe I can retro fit them?
Is this what you want?http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/6153-bling/page__hl__bling__fromsearch__1
Buy a merc <LOL>
That is one solution except the SQ is by miles a far better car
"Yes, have to agree. I have driven a GLC & GLE. Ok,the tech is a lot better & quicker to load, but that's it.Mrs Rappy has a brand new Mini Cabriolet & that has the same, projecting the Mini logo. Just noticed the other day, it's only for the drivers side, which is a bit mean & stingy.If you were to compare what would you say the SQ5 does better?Rappy."
"Most things haha! Not impressed with the gear selector on steering column, radio controls etc is terrible it's the touch pad thingy with wheel and it's not good at all maybe better if it was a left hooker so you could use right hand to control. iPad sticking out of dash looks crap. Seats are worse. SQ5 is just a far better car. Yes some things are a little dated like the mmi but if it ain't broke don't fix it. I do like the door mirror lights and illuminated kick plates in merc. The mimic screens for what engine is doing (hp and torque) and what suspension / steering is cool. it is a nice car but not worth the extra coin imo."
"With all the bad publicity about diesel motors at the moment, just wondered if the majority of new orders are still diesels. I average about 10k miles pa and was trying to decide which would be the best option for me, both in respect of performance, residual values etc. I have never owed a petrol SUV before.Any advice would be appreciated."
"I'm in southern Ontario, Canada. There are a lot of differences here, from fuel prices to weather. VAG can't sell diesels in North America since Dieselgate, and the anti-diesel rhetoric is strong.On the flip side, I'm driving my first Audi, first SUV, first AWD, and first diesel (3.0L). I never want to go back to a gasoline (petrol) engine! I get a massive 428 ft-lbs of torque, with 0-60 mph acceleration in about 6.4sec.Andif I treat is super gently on the highway (under ideal conditions), I've got as good as nearly 52 MPG (US) = nearly 62 MPG Imp. I'm sold on diesel, Dieselgate notwithstanding."
I currently own an A6 3.0l avant coming from a 2.0l q5 TDI . I am now looking to go back to the q5. I do love the low down torque of diesels but given the bad press at the moment not sure which one to go far. I always buy my cars so concerned about what the market will think in 3 years time.When I was in Austria I saw several Audi events promoting the q5 every one was a petrol version perhaps just a coincidence? As said previously will only be doing about 10k per year so as long as the real world driving mpg is ok would consider petrol (I think).
"For me I'm happy with diesel the emissions scandal was probably enevitable with one major manufacturer so as far as I'm concerned it's not relevant. If it's a race car you want then yes petrol is better but you wouldnt be driving a q5! You'd have an rs4 or rs6. For me the sq5 is a great all rounder relatively fast, relatively economical, cheap tax for power figures and size and with the trick exhaust it gives you the sound of a v8 so happy days really. The cost of petrol in USA I would quite happily have a petrol version as it's only about 50 pence a litre and they don't sell the diesel sq over there"
"As I said previously I have ordered a new 2.0 TDI diesel Q5 but had second thoughts after Mayor Khans directives and nearly every day this week the Daily Mail spelling doom for every diesel car owner. After a lot of thought and conversation with my dealer have decided to stick with the diesel, I have decided that if choosing a smaller 4 cylinder engine SUV, diesel is the way to go, I just think it suits the style of driving I do in a SUV, like James said ""if its a race car you want then yes petrol is better"" which for me sums it up in a nutshell !"
It's a shame that people still want to buy a diesel cars. I absolutely hate to inhale those toxic fumes when taking a walk in the city. That for me is enough to not choose a diesel.
"Sorry if my post got a bit OTT maybe and out of context since I put it so short. Thing is that I have myself owned several diesels. Audi SQ5 is one of them, but I sold that one over a year ago. Right now in a Macan Turbo - pleased with the car, but not with the drivetrain. Live in a big city and for me the next car must be a hybrid or a full EV. Have test driven a Tesla Model S and that might be my next car. That instant torque is just unbelievable. Future is clearly EV and I'm a bit irritated that we have to wait several years before the germans can come up with any decent alternatives."
"22-25mpg from a Macan Turbo is Walter Mitty taking Miss Daisy for a drive. Tesla is the best of the rest, but still a joke if you want to travel any distance. Spending an hour waiting for the batteries to charge is not my idea of progress."
"My view is based on actual experience. Tesla 100 % charge leaving Aberdeen, 1 hour charge at Perth. We did have a blast round and set the lap record for an electric car around Knockhill circuit. Unlike most petrol stations, Tesla supercharge never seem to be conveniently located beside coffee shops."
"EV's will only really take off once fast charging stations are as commonplace as a petrol pump. My wife has an i3, and as great a little car as it is, she (and I) do get range panic at times. In reality, it does the job great and the 2 stroke range extender is a godsend, but I won't consider changing the main car to electric until I can stop at a 'gas' station and re-charge in 15 mins without finding the charging station is out of service, or there is a 2 hour wait etc. Great idea, maybe not quite ready for general mass consumption yet."
"Rubicon said:Hehe, true regarding the Macan Turbo mpg. That's with cruise control engaged following the speed limits. If driving spirited the fuel consumption get's really nasty. I changed to this car from an 2013 SQ5 and that had great mpg in comparison. Still Macan is a very nice car. Regarding the Tesla charging I think you do the same mistake as many do who actually haven't tested and just read stuff on the internet. The 1 hour charging time is just a misconception actually. I've done some long road trips together with a friend of mine who have a Tesla. You just start off with a full charged battery from home, then you drive for let's say 2-3 hours without stopping (motorway driving). then you take a break at a super charger for 15-20 minutes and during that time you load up with approx 150 new miles. So you never in real life run the battery from 100 -> 0. You run it in the area of 20-80%. And in this region the charging is much quicker at the supercharger. Fact is that it takes equally long to charge between 80->100% as it takes to charge between 20->60%. No Tesla owner charge 90->100% on road trips to make it that 1 hour stop over. I've done a couple of 500 miles trips in Teslas. They usually require 3 stop overs of 20 minutes each. Which is perfect for taking a coffee, a bite and some fresh air. Actually who doesn't on a roadtrip? You NEVER need to stop over for 1 hour. Maybe require longer stops if you have any of the smaller batteries or run any of the older Teslas. But for instance the new 100kw battery pack will come very close to running a ICE car on a road trip. To tell the truth - my favorite road trips are actually in Teslas because you're less fatigue when arriving to the destination. And if you take a 7 hour roadtrip, if you loose let's say 30 minutes running in a Tesla would that be a big issue for you? Just asking. If I can't spare 30 minute on that trip I'd take a flight and a taxi. There are lot's of preconceptions that in real life are just not relevant. And one other thing is that you don't need to spend time hassling with card payment when you fill up and moving the car after you're done with filling up and park it up somewhere else when you need to visit the rest room and buy a coffee. There you save another few minutes of time and sum it all up and I would estimate that each stop over takes 5 minutes more in a Tesla. It's quite far off from that hour. And also keep in mind that on a 500 miles roadtrip you probably stop for let's say 40 minutes on one occasion to eat some more. Then you can charge a bit more on that stop and stay shorter on the other two. So the split will be 10 minutes, 40 minutes, 10 minutes. Also, each morning you wake up with a fully charged car. And I wonder how many ppl who drive 250+miles many days a year? Because if you don't you never need to visit a petrol station because your car is always fully charged when you wake up in the morning. Brilliant! Of course for it to work smooth it is for convenience a must to have access to overnight charing. For those not having this I can understand that it ain't as convenient. But if you have an expensive car I assume you want to have it garaged anyway and soon there will be charging capabilities in every garage if there already isn't. And oh... my apologies for going a bit OT, but thought it was a good place to respond about some general incorrect views about EV's.Click to expand...The Official Brochure right there,Maybe you should just forget Audi, Porsche, and jump right in !!"
"Just to add to the Going off topic. I owned a Q5 2.0 tdi for 3 years, sold it for a Tesla model S, partly due to emissions, mainly due to performance and gadgets. Also major tax breaks if you own a business.Q5 wins on build quality, Tesla wins on everything else. Take the plunge you won't regret it."
"With all the bad publicity about diesel motors at the moment, just wondered if the majority of new orders are still diesels. I average about 10k miles pa and was trying to decide which would be the best option for me, both in respect of performance, residual values etc. I have never owed a petrol SUV before.Any advice would be appreciated."
I was at the Tesla factory this morning...Maybe i can give you an insight to the future thats been played with. No more car charging points.... your car charges itself as you drive (if needed) and you pay through a blockchain enabled device installed within the car.
"There is a new 8 stall tesla supercharger at doubletrees in dundee,i am considering tesla for my next car as our commute is 50 miles round trip and hardly go anywhere outside 100 mile radius using my sq.Only sad thing is the ved hike on £40k+ new vehicles which although isnt a deal breaker its certainly annoying especially for electric vehicles.Performance wise its where i want to be but still weighing up the pros and cons."
"Still a lot dearer than a Q or SQ though even with the government rebate. Do they hold their value or do they drop as fast as the Nissan EV? Also how do the batteries cope with sub-zero N Scotland temperatures?Acceleration sounds pretty impressive on paper but using it presumably hammers the range. Presumably you have a long range car as well given your comment about not going further than 100 miles in the SQ.Is there a dealer in Scotland now, and if so where?"
"The Gvt also benefits from VAT on the vehicle - the more expensive the vehicle the more VAT we end up paying so the more the Gvt gets. On a £40k motor we are paying in the region of £6k tax. It seems that Gvt doesn't think this is enough.I just cannot believe the sheer greed of this government. Luckily I can afford a new Q5, however both my wife and myself have had to work hard to make this possible and sacrifice other things in our life."
Well some one has to pay for the subsidies for the low emission vehicles..All cars should pay the same road tax. The fuel VAT and list price VAT is already putting in extra money for those making decisions to have those vehicles..
"There shouldn't even be a road tax IMO, putting it on the fuel is the fairest way - so that'll never happen"
"Big dilemma for me, have ordered a new diesel Q5 and all over the press today is the transport ministerChris Grayling advising motorists to 'think hard' before buying diesel. Don't know whether to change to a Petrol unit, advice would be greatly received as I have only driven diesels for the last 20 odd years and would be interested in how petrol Q5's drive, I think the 2.0l petrol unit produces 250 odd bhp but obviously less torque does this detract from the driving experience ?"
"Skiman said:Fair point, I guess at the end of the day it's going to be horses for courses. I am not particularly thrilled with the adblue refills etc, but if it reduces pollution that's fine. I mentioned earlier about my wife switching from a diesel TTR to a petrol. I still prefer the driving experience of the diesel. If I said this on the TT forum I am sure I would have been laughed off the forum by the petrol head enthusiasts.Don't forget that there are still pollution issues with petrol engines as well - hence the switch of Gvt policy years ago (yes I know the experts are more aware of the implications of diesel engines). If I was only doing a very low annual manage I guess I perhaps could have been persuaded to go do the petrol route, conversely if I was doing 30k per year - no chance.Click to expand...It's your money and your choice, but don't believe all you read. I recall those same ""experts"" were encouraging us to buy diesel to save green house gasses a few years back."
".I am getting fed up with all the advice from the so called experts, so I think will go with what appears to be best for my circumstances."
I'm happy with the diesel SQ. as other people have said test drive both and see which your happier with. I do know some European countries are wanting to ban diesels by 2020
When I started this thread I mentioned that when I was in Austria i saw several launch vehicles plus one Q5 in the UK every one was a petrol version. I wonder if the manufacturers are altering the ratio of petrol/diesel engines in anticipation of public option/legislation change. Anyway still no regret on my choice of diesel!
"Thanks for all the reply's most appreciated, I agree that the low down torque characteristics of the diesel really suits largish SUV cars. As buying the car outright with my hard earned cash and savings worried that in a few year down the line the value might plummet. I have spoken to my dealer and can change if I want to, but its not just the driving experience I am worried about but the larger road tax bill, along with the dearer price tag and lower mpg, any ideal what sort of real world mpg I would expect ? So still in a dilemma !"
"With all the bad publicity about diesel motors at the moment, just wondered if the majority of new orders are still diesels. I average about 10k miles pa and was trying to decide which would be the best option for me, both in respect of performance, residual values etc. I have never owed a petrol SUV before.Any advice would be appreciated."
"With it being a brand new model you'll be the guinea pigs to a certain extent. Personally I'd go with the one that's going to best meet my current needs and try not to worry too much about what may or may not happen with future residuals.FWIW I can't see anything drastic happening with diesels any time soon, I still plan on keeping mine for a few years yet."
"I agree with you, normally I would be concerned about it being a new model. The technology is fairly well tested on other models as is the mechanics, I appreciate that it is still a gamble so fingers crossed."
"Skiman said:My ultimate decision was based on what I really want from the car, yes depreciation is an important factor as my cash is also hard earned. I would rather (reluctantly) take a gamble on depreciation and thoroughly enjoy driving the car with the characteristics I like. Yes I am sure some will say that the petrol is a better drive, sportier etc. but for me anyway will stick with diesel. Many years ago I remember the bashing the press gave to 4x4, Chelsea tractors etc. without trying to sound arrogant it is my choice at the end of the day. I don't tell other people what they should or shouldn't drive for environmental or other reasons. I am quite happy in the knowledge with adblue that at this moment in time everything is being done by the manufacturers to make these cars as environmentally friendly as possible.Click to expand...Thanks Skiman, my heart is with a Diesel, brain saying are you sure ! Anyway got a couple of weeks to decide but I am 99% sure will be sticking with the diesel."
Which ever one you decide to go for I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy it. I will pick my new motor up end of March. It could have mid March but due to other commitments cannot collect it then. I am normally not excited about collecting the car but given the colour and how good the car looks cannot wait.
"Being a fellow Navarra blue owner in waiting, cannot wait also !"

I drove an A4 with the 252 engine mated to the PDK gearbox this week and it was both punchy in the mid range and fast although it appeared less refined under acceleration than my Q5.Again I would advise you do what Missile suggests; drive both engines back to back then make an informed choice as it your money and your car to drive and live with.At the risk of sounding like a tight git Scotsman £40k is a lot of money so better to spend it on the right thing for you.Click to expand...Cheers CruicdGoing to sleep on it for the next few days but I must say the petrol is looking attractive."
"I have specked Navarra blue , have not seen it in the flesh but took a chance as it looks fantastic in photo's and you tube. Just wondered will you be purchasing paint protection from the dealer ?"
"I am really fussy about colour choice and as soon as I saw the Navarra blue I knew it was for me. Incidentally yesterday saw a Navarra blue one at my local dealer (they had one on loan for a day). The weather was grey and dull but the car still looked great.With regard to paint protection I didn't take up the dealership offer. If I had wanted it I would go to a local valeting specialist and pay them to do it, as that is what they specialise in."
"Thanks for the info Skiman regarding the colour very encouraging, at present my Q3 is in Daytona grey looks fantastic when the sun is shining but a bit drab when its dull, probably going to use a local detailer to protect my new vehicle also."
"I have a similar issue, my A6 Avant is Dakota grey, in good light the car looks great but in dull light not so great. The Metallic in the Navarra blue really stands out even in dull light compared to many grey cars."

"Hi everyone,, my wife`s SQ5 is now needing its first inspection service and oil change, Audi have quoted £395 plus VAT. Audi say the labour charge is 1.4 hours around £150 so parts add up to £250 (oil, sump plug. pollen filter and screen wash) ..what a joke !!My friend has his SQ5 done at a local independent using genuine parts for £196 inc vat.What`s the best price anyone has got for inspection service and oil change from their Audi dealer."
Ayr Audi quoted me £500.00
UNBELIEVABLE.. they are taking the p... My son had his RS3 serviced at Wakefield Audi for £105 he supplied his own oil to them so reasonable for parts and labour
have been through this same grief with my local Audi dealer - get a local garage (within 15miles) of the Audi dealer to give you a written and itemised quotation - the Audi should then match it under their Price Match offerI ended up getting the Oil Change down from £244 to £167First Inspection not due until end of May so will leave that haggling for later!
"I am thinking of taking out a service plan on my new car, I do about 10,000 miles a year does anybody know what Audi would charge per month on a service only plan (Audi Complete) ?"
"Audi prices are silly.Parts bought through TPS are significantly cheaper, I paid in the region of £100 for all genuine parts."
Got a full service tomorrow at Audi Brighton for £310... The intermediate one (if I recall correctly) was about £150.
Any recommends for service independants in South of Scotland.Thanks

They are saying the fault code is p204B00 relating to fault for reduction agent pressure sender.
Go buy your own adblue at a filling station to clear that problem first.
"This seems a bit strange. You put car in to top up Adblue. Presumably there was no fault before, so why is there a problem now? Ask for fault code. Did they do the emission recall, is this causing an issue?As suggested, top up the Adblue and see what happens. Do not run the car without Adblue."
Adblue been topped by myself now but showing 20 miles of adblue left still. Fault code is as above post and there was no engine management light on until we got back from them. It says on the paperwork that no updates have been done as it may wipe the problem but may not fix it. Basically the car went in for update and adblue and now it's goosed on the drive with engine management light that wasn't on before and they want £300 which will probably rise to £900!!
Update on situation. Emailed Warrington Audi over the weekend and this morning they have come and collected the car so all credit to them for that and fingers crossed it gets resolved.
How much did you put in? Is there any sign of leakage underneath the car?
"First time I tried to fill it up, with one of the 10 ltr canisters with attachable nozzle, I must say it wasn't that simple and I had a couple of litres blow back and end up on the floor, no matter how carefully I tried pouring it.It's pretty heavy and a bit awkward ( around 10kg I guess)Only way I got it in smoothly after trial and error was by holding the thing just above horizontal."
Put 10ltrs in. No spillage so every drop went in and zero leaks.
I meant leakage from the pump that would show signs of a puddle underneath.I managed to get 10 litres in with no spillage
Does any one know when the UK official launch is going to be?
"Hello, I spoke to a dealer the other day, I was told they are expecting diesels to be arriving mid March, test drive around the 20th (they did offer me a diesel to purchase prior to April so I could get it registered etc)Previously the official launch was April. They seem to be on track for this."
Update on this from two dealers contacting me today. Latest official launch date is 14th March. Launch Q5's are now at UK ports.
"What is best tyres for 21s on sq5, that has been discussed?"
More than once <LOL> Everyone has their favourite.
Whats your favourite?
"There's only 3 or 4 to choose from, they're all premium brands, if I was you I'd just go with whatever's the best deal at the moment.I briefly had Dunlops, now on Pirellis, nothing to choose between them as far as I can tell, Dunlop's footprint looked slightly wider."
Perhaps that's bestCheers
"It's all opinion - how would one judge or proclaim such a claim?Wet? snow? dry? MPG? noise? wear/longevity?Personally I avoid michelin primarily as they are french, but also due to the road noise.Pirelli or Goodyear."
"Goodyear don't do one in that size unfortunately, it's got to be either Pirelli, Michelin, Conti or Dunlop."
Thanks guys
"I check for deals every now and again, best I've found was Dunlops for just under £180. Nothing sticking out at the moment though, Pirellis from Camskill at £200 is the lowest sticker price I can find but doesn't include delivery or fitting so better deals are probably out there."
"Stupid question, but I am good at them, will 20"" tyres fit 21"" rims heard 20s were better, but not going buying more wheels?"
Thought so but thanks
"SteveMcB said:No mate, they won't fitYour only option apart from the OME 255/40 R21 may be a 265/40 R21 which is 10mm wider than standard so 5mm either side. I think they will be fine on the 8.5"" wide rim but you would have to check with the experts.There is a wider, excuse the pun, range of tyres in that size and some are quite a bit cheaper. I'll be looking further into this myself when it's time for new treads.Click to expand...If you do try the 265's please let us know if it's OK. I would be interested in this if it was safe and OK to do. I think the rear tyres on the SQ could do with a slightly wider look."
Whats the thoughts on here with 265/40/R21?
What engine oil is everyone using for their SQ5?

"All a bitpredictablebut the petrol SQ5 details have just been anounced at the Detroit showhttp://www.autocar.c...troit-349bhp-v6349 bhp and 0-62 in 5.4 seconds, just wondering if the diesel version will follow or even if this petrol version is UK bound"
Official Audi Video in the new Azores green of the SQ5https://www.youtube....h?v=sLZKtAirEdg
"Diesel is dead, VW/Audi are moving to electric major cities are planning on banning diesel power cars completely.I'm surprised this has been debuted in the US not EU"
The 4.0T in the SQ would have been nice
Audi UK website hints at ordering for the new SQ5 starting at the end of January with delivery in the summerwww.audi.co.uk/about-audi/latest-news/all-new-354ps-audi-sq5-heads-for-detroit-under-tfsi-power.html
I'm sure it would be a beast but that V8 engine would be very heavy upfront - I'm sure even the RSQ5 when it arrives will only have a further tuned 3.0T petrol with around 440 bhp and 550-600 Nm
"Audi press release sadly states that the sports diff is an option, but at least it is available"
"So, if it end up being petrol only, then looks like : less power, a lot less torque, slower, more emissions, more thirsty, and no doubt more expensive.Not got a lot going for it really................."
Just spoke to my dealer who confirmed SQ5 ordering would start at the end of January with first deliveries at the end of April or early May.I was just about ready to go down the S4 Avant route so I'm now going to wait to see the UK pricing and specification and if necessary live with the higher VED rates if I go down the SQ5 route again. If I don't it appears there are plenty of S4 Avant's in dealer stock so if I go down that route I'm pretty confident I could still avoid the rate rise and pick up a 13% discount that I know won't be forthcoming on an SQ5 for a while
"In terms of the 40T, very unlikely to happen even though the original RS5 did have a V8. Audi use platforms to reduce costs, look at the A5 to see what's going to happen with the Q5 as they are stables mates. It's interesting that at present no large engine TDI offerings are currently available.Wait and see time.."
"Was planning on going Petrol for our replacement so the new SQ5 may tick all the boxes, however if the base price is £50k+ I'll either go down the S4 Avant route which is starting at around £40k after discount or look more closely at a low specification Macan GTS"
Looks like it's petrol for EU too.
"Those unduly concerned with such matters should rest assured a diesel version will follow, though. Audi board member Dr Dietmar Voggenreiter has confirmed to Top Gear that both petrol and diesel versions will be offered, the petrol launching first to please the SQ5's doubtless large US and Chinese audiences""This was a very simple decision,"" he tells us. ""The last time we started with diesel, and this time we start with the petrol, which is more worldwide market focused. But there will still be a diesel. As Europeans we love the SQ5 as a TDI version.""As quoted in Top Gear"

"SQ5 priced in Germany at Euro 64,900 which is 3750 more than the S4 Avant, assuming the same uplift in the UK suggests a basic starting price to me of just under £50K as it won't be as well equipped as the current SQ5 Plus and SQ5 Plus SE"
"UK pricing for the SQ5 is announced at £50,900 and ordering goes live today, I just spec'd a car on the configurator and got to £57,970 without 21's, the optional sports diff or adaptive cruise so I can see cars easily getting to £60Kspecification is as I expected although S Adaptive Air Suspension is listed as a £1,000 option, and 21"" alloys are £1500Heated leather electric sports seats with the bench seat are standard together with LED lights with high beam assist and full navigation are standard"
"I could be tempted given they have a petrol option this time.Not sure i like the idea of the ultra Q system on the lower models, you are losing full 4wd."
"I'm going to talk to my Audi SA but I think £60K is too rich for an SQ5 when I can get into a Macan GTS with a few toys for similar money - I wouldn't specify the 21"" wheels but I wanted a brighter metallic blue along the lines of SepangOf course if there is a deal to be done on the SQ5 then that's another story but then you end up paying for it come trade in - was talking to my Audi guy about an S4 Avant before the SQ5 details emerged but with £7K off straight away I can't see the S4 residuals being very good in three years time"
"It looks lovely but VED is £1200 for first year. Ouch! This is clearly going to affect discounts, especially when Macan's are knocking on the door and currently holding over 80% residual!"
"21"" wheels turn out to be a costly option, £1500 to spec them, then another £400 on first years VED over the 20""s because the emissions move the car into the next bracket. Second thoughts there then!!!"

Mmmmmmm not sure.
I'd say gorgeous looking car... but not the color I'd choose or want.
Top one is viper green - these colours work better on sporty Audis.
One word for both of those....'brave'.
Prefer the top one.
"I thought the SQ5 was bad enough, but I just had a B8 RS4 in the same green as the top picture pass me on the outskirts of Downham Market. Not to my taste at all."
It's a nice bright colour and makes the car stand out but I wouldn't have picked the colour or want to own it
"I actually like both... but I'd pay a lot less than I would for a 'normal' colour.EDIT: can the moderators get these pix in the splash page set of Q5 pictures?would add come colour, alongside the yellow one already there..."
That should come with a free paper bag. Not surprised it is low mileage.

I couldn't even find an AUX-in port. There was a MMI connector provided with the car but it comes only with an apple connector but even then I cant figure out where to plug that in.Can anyone help/guide or direct to any guides or videos for this stuff.Cheers,Ash"
Thanks Snowman....My model doesn't have Audi Connecr so no luck with that or me I guess....I get the music being copied using a computer bit but wanted to know how I could do it in the car using the copy function. I believe it a be done only when your phone is connected to MMI but not via Bluetooth....Will try tht option....Thanks again

"Looking at Q5's on Autotrader, particularly if the car is less than 3 years old, manual transmissions are in the minority, as in about only 20% of all available, so you're seriously limiting your choice.It's not a sports car, & much more relaxing with autobox.if you're determined to have a manual, the only possible way you'll know for sure is to go to your nearest Audi dealer and test drive one."
My b8 a4 was a manual and the offset pedals didn't bother me but the last 2 cars both autos and I wouldn't go back to a manual unless it was a classic hot hatch type car. Newer autos are far more pleasurable to drive and the technology has come a long way since the 80s when auto gearboxs were simply horrible!
"After driving nothing but manual transmissions for almost 4 decades, my current car, a Q5, is my first automatic. I love it!

"Now driven a couple of manual Q5's and pleased to report, pedals are not an issue. Might be something to do with my size 12's compensating for a very slight off set !"
That is such an outdated argument these days.
"I was an 'auto' hater as well, the older gearboxes were awful and ruined the driving experience for me, it felt like the 'clutch' was constantly slipping. Technology has come a long way though, I drove countless top end cars recently and only a couple of the older ones had a clutch pedal.Manual still has a place but I've owned 2 cars with tiptronic now and must admit I prefer it."

I wouldn't put all season tyres on my car...IMO they're a compromise in summer and winter. I'd always advocate summer tyres for + 7 degrees and winter tyres and rims for below that.

"Contrary to popular practice, I am not in favour of rotating tyres.

It seems from this site that these do not last as long and I wonder if they are fitted because they are ""softer"" than the Bridgestones to ease up the stiffer suspension?"
I think not. My previous Q5 S Line had Michelin and my current SQ5 has Bridgestone. I would suggest Audi fit whatever is available and at the cheapest price they can negotiate.
"The Nexen N'fera tyres I had fitted a year ago have been pretty good. Considering I needed 4 in an emergency and this was the only matching 4 I could get fitted on the same day, I have been pleasantly surprised!"
Just had mine serviced at 3 years - 24k miles - still 5-5.5mm tread on all four corners for the original supplied goodyear excellence rubber - very pleased with that.

I just put some Michelin Latitude sport 3s on the rears. £240/corner.
Oponeo are doing the 21s for £225.
How are you finding these? I've had the same on the rear for a few months but they seem to make the rear of the car really twitchy. Either that or I've got some suspension issues and it's a coincidence it started about the same time as changing the rear tyres.
"Honestly, we only had them put on the other day so it's kinda hard to tell and the SQ is the wife's car so she drives it mostly.It's the rear we had swapped too. I need to check the pressures this weekend and will have a play then."
re my previous post - now need to change my Mich Latitude Sport at 21k miles. I suppose not bad but they do seem noisy and twitchy (may be because they are worn to 3mm though!). Think I will go back to Bridgestone.
"Almost 3 years and 38,000 miles, after I started started this thread, my rear Goodyear tyres has 4mm tread remaining. The fronts have been swapped for winters each season and have the same tread left, so I guess the fronts have done about 26k miles. looking to get to 50k miles on the rears"
Do you not swap the rears to winters as well? If not that is contrary to all advice given (by Audi and tyre manufacturers) and could give you problems .....................
Does it ever snow in Hampshire?
Car has leas than 1k miles on it and whilst out in it this afternoon tried to put it in manual but had no control via paddles or gear leaver.Tried to stick it in sport manually and also via dynamic mode and stayed in D.Tried same with eco mode and stayed in D as opposed to moving to E.Cant play with it just now as kids in bed and wife away out but i am looking for suggestions of anything to do to un stick it/fault find? and will also give audi call if no joy tomorrow.
"I'd be concerned, dealer visit IMO."
"Hi All,How much would you expect to pay to get your wheels changed from front to back?will they need balancing etc? or is it just a straight swap?thanks"
"As long as the wheels are already all balanced they won't need done. I've had mine off a couple of times, they are heavy buggrs, but I'd do it myself as well, you could be looking at £30 - £40 to get someone else to do it."
Relatively inexpensive from Halfords. A must have if swapping wheels around on a regular basis (for me 3 cars twice per year when going from summer to winter and back again) ..................

"I just used the factory jack, my trolley has sprung a leak! I'd pay a tenner to have someone else do it though."
Sounds like a great deal. I tried for ages before giving up when I couldn't get my wheels off.
Torque is 140NM or 100lbft which is tighter than the Audi saloons.I don't bother swapping tyres. I like to monitor the wear pattern just in case there is a tracking or bush problem. Wear patterns can tell a lot about a car.
Is this about right for a Q5 of any model then?
Same for all Q5's
"Wow cheap labour rates in the south! I have the tools but @ £10 for 4 I'd be tempted to hand over the cash to save myself the time. 20"" Wheels are quite heavy with tyres on."
"Please dont think im being stupid, when set to auto how do you know when the headlights come on in lower light times, on my merc it has a light on the main speedo dials to let you know. I have been flashed a few times which makes me think they are not on, then I should override the switch"
"Never had an issue with auto setting, main beam always comes on for me at dusk. Should be easy for you to confirm if main beam is on by illumination of the road ahead, when it is dark.There is also a change in illumination of the instrument panel as the main beam comes on.If you are being flashed it seems more likely that someone thinks you are not aware main beam is on?"
"Never had a problem with them, there's a setting in the MMI which lets you choose from a couple of sensitivity options."
Just as Missile says.
I think the light switch illuminates when on but not sure but the sat nav definitely changes colour to night mode.
When auto lights are illuminated the side light icon on the light switch turns green. The nav display will also go to the night setting as mentioned by Greasemonger.
"I just look at the nav - if it's in night mode, the lights are on."
Just completed a two hour drive around Glasgow today with varying weather and light conditions and this is the observations made :-When auto lights are illuminated the side light icon on the light switch turns green.On my set up the Sat Nav did not go into night mode until it was darker outside so in some instances headlights were on but Sat Nav was still in day mode.I could force the Nav into night mode at any time by selecting side lights or headlights.
"Anyone know exactly where the auto lights sensor is located? i just assume it is in the rear view mirror stalk. But there also seems to be something on the front (facing forward) on the mirror itself?I have my auto lights setting in MMI set to late to keep LED only on as much as possible. This used to work well, but recently car seems to just have lights main lights on mostly. Not sure if its dark mornings and evenings or a bit of dirt over he sensor area...?"
"Weird, I use the same settings but lately mine has been doing this as well. It is a bit grubby but I'm pretty sure the sensors are behind the swept area of screen.Not a Q5 but probably the same set uphttp://www.audi-spor...-sensor.290364/"
I also noticed at weekend that headlights can be on but sat nav stays on day mode (was during the day)
It works by comparing the light hitting the front to that hitting the rear
"Doesn't seem to do anything for me, looks identical switched on or off"
From what I understand it's the on/off for the auto dimming feature?
Yeah but you will be hard pressed to notice much of a change. Maybe it only changes very slowly? Also in US they get a compass on the mirror!Edit - yes it changes slowly:
On the subject of silly questions. What is the humidity sensor for.
"Please dont think im being stupid, when set to auto how do you know when the headlights come on in lower light times, on my merc it has a light on the main speedo dials to let you know. I have been flashed a few times which makes me think they are not on, then I should override the switch"
What is best wipers front and back to get apart from Audi Dealerships.
Bosch everytime!
Bosch blades generally although recently there clips have become very poor quality!
buy Bosch (and only Bosch) on eBay from a reputable seller and save yourself a fortune.i never ever buy wipers from main dealers.
"Same. Bosch. Can't go wrong. I get mine from Amazon, and replace them once a year... ish."
"My Alloys are being re-furbed next week and I am considering changing the finish from the current factory option as I feel they look a bit bland!I am planning on keeping the diamond cut finish, but feel the current Grey inner Wheel colour doesn't stand out enough against the silver on the flat faces of the wheel.Has anyone changed the colour finish on their diamond cut Alloys?The other option is to powder coat them... any thoughts?Thanks in advance."
"Thanks for your reply Steve.My SQ5 is Monsoon Grey and I don't think the full Black finish would suit it.Black Wheels looks good on your Blue SQ5 though... decisions, decisions."
"Cheers, although - IMO - I think black would go really well with Monsoon, particularly if you've got BP.If I was doing mine again I'd probably go for the satin finish though."
If your getting the wheels refurbished I don't think it would be vastly more expensive to change the colour and keep the diamond cut parts. As you just powder coat the whole wheel then skim the face.
I don't like full black as it makes the wheels look much smaller. I know titanium with diamond cut is the standard but the diamond cut black wheels you can get on standard q5. If you have photoshop I would be curious to see what white wheels look like with or without diamond cut finish especially on a blue car i think it pop!

"Hi All,Due to loosing my internet for a few weeks, not been on much.I currently drive in individual with all set to dynamic, apart from engine gearbox in auto.If I use the drive select & switch to Dynamic, is this the same as moving the gearlever to sport.On the odd occasion I want sharper engine response & quicker gear changed. I'm guessing both do the same.Also, if I switch to manual, does this keep the car in Sport?Please help?Thanks,Rappy."
Depends on the model and options fitted....
"Ok, to be more specifc.My Audi is a SQ5 Plus with drive select.Thanks,Rappy."
"Basically no. Sport diff is a complete gimmick and makes 0 diff, even less to performance...the Q is not a sports car and is not meant to be. ADS is a toy, you can crontrol the noise but not much more"
"I'm always in Dynamic but in drive, sport is too snappy on the box, only really drop back into sport if having a play"
"SteveMcB said:I leave mine in 'individual' all the time, which is everything in dynamic except gearbox which is in comfort. I find it changes a bit too often in 'sport' for day to day use and, particularly when under load, the changes can be a bit rough for my liking. On the occasions I want the gearbox in sport I use the gear lever.If I want to nick on a bit I generally use the paddles, backing off the power slightly as you would in a manual makes the changes a lot smoother than 'sport' mode and is slightly more involving, for me anyway.Click to expand...Agree. You can keep the car in the correct range for gearshifts, vs Sport red lining in ever gear WTF, it's not a petrol.The new mode I'm using is great. Sharper engine with gearbox in DRappy."
"As we are still talking diff, the above quote should add some traction lol!!And ref to ADS. You have a seperate setting for the sport dif.Rappy"
"Engineers don't makes videos, the word you need is marketing... and I'm definitely not confused by it having used it many times.And if we believe top gears commments it's a ""mummy's cross"" with 30mm lower than the SQ ride height, oh dear.But I'm happy to agree, to disagree... regardless of that if it ticks your box be it a color, a wheel design who cares? enjoy."
I understand how a sports dif will give greater control over a car that does not. But you would have to be driving at some pretty high speed in corners or on a track to notice.Shame there is no videos comparing the SQ5 to the SQ5 plus.
... or driving like an idiot.

Who has ever parked in two spaces? I have done in the past if it's a none busy car park usually parking at the far end. If you park in a single bay at the end of empty car park you sometime soon would comeback to 1 or 2 cars either side of you...But these days with 2 small children I prefer the bigger child bays.Watch this before you reply:Just beware:https://youtu.be/nDvSPKfXGvM
"LOL sounds like my parking routine, bay furthest from the door and that's just with the old A4, I try not to take the SQ to the shops"
"Honestly, if the car park is quiet and there are plenty of spaces I have no issue with someone taking the precaution of parking across two bays but, this Christmas I drove into a very busy car park, people had to queue for 10 mins and it was 1 in 1 out, and I still found people who had arrived early and took up two spaces, which actually is plainignorant.imo. I take the SQ most places and I do look for a space that is slightly bigger than normal or if that isn't available I look for a space between two new or more expensive vehicles as I (maybe wrongly) assume that the owner will be as careful opening doors as I am."
"Quite surprised at the question, TBH. Not looking to pick a fight but I'd never dream of taking two spaces - seems pretty selfish to me.Most people's cars are their pride and joy, whether they spent £500 or £50k on them - just because ours cost more than some others doesn't mean we get special privileges.Just my opinion, of course."
"End spaces always a good choice, reverse in with passenger side as close to the wall as possible, let passenger out first of course."
"Hats off to Hampton shopping centre in Peterborough. Their normal bays are wider than the average, and they've got some extra wide ones that are on the bend on the border of the car park, albeit a loooong walk from the shops, but there's always one of them available."
"""But people's cars are not the only thing to expand and cause people to park badly, it has been suggested. According to Edmund King, chief executive of the AA, the expansion of people's waistlines over the years means they are also more likely to take up two parking spaces for fear of getting stuck between cars.""Gull wing doors are the solutionhttps://www.youtube....h?v=QkJTqrWf5KY"
"Bays haven't changed since the 70s, problem is car as much bigger now...That car needs putting out of it's misery.."
Agreed. I don't think the bay sizes have changed much over the decades... cars are wider/bigger. We follow our American cousins and develop Crossovers and the like despite our tiny roads and limited car parks.
"Problem is, what is expensive or valuable to you, isn't to someone else,What about the 17yo with a 4yo Focus, to him its his pride and joy. So he should get 2 spaces too.No one wants their property damaged."
Many of the ones I was referring to (in Germany) were in newly built and marked out car parks ......................
"Only shop I've been to with decent sized standard bays is Costco, probably the US influence."
"I spend alot of time in Frankfurt, Neckarsulm, Walldorf and Stuttgart certainly in the corp car parks i haven't noticed that, but at the same time i never looked too hard either. But i will next week.."
"Was at Audi today, speaking about first service for SQ5, which will be needed in a couple ofmonths.Spokeabout oil change in gearbox and differential, and was told they never get changed atall.Seemsstrange??"
"Typically its not changed, the box has a lifetime seal on although it is possible to change"
"My A4 is booked in to get the gearbox oil done next week, not a particularly cheap job so good to know the SQ might not need it."
Just seems strange it will never need changed?
"As winter sets in, and I do a 20 mile commute to and from work, I'm noticing a difficulty in keeping my screens front & rear clean.Always streaked and dirty.I never noticed this with previous Q5.I'm assuming my wipers are ok, as hardly used, so must be the washer liquid I'm using, i.e just pretty basic Tesco or Halford ready mixed.Anyone have the same issues, which they've found a solution too?Any home made recipes or special brands which do the job better?Thanks."
I use the Audi one across all the car and dont have an issue.On the windscreen however i have noticed the inside getting dirty quicker which annoys me no end.
Costco do bags of 36 microfibre towels for about £13. At that price they're almost disposable but I'm piling the dirty ones up in the garage for wash day.They're good for general valeting purposes but I also keep a clean one in the car for wiping the inside of the screen.
You could trythis
After washing the vehicle i clean the windows and wiper blades using Autoglym Fast Glass.Water bottle is filled with Autoglym Ultimate Screen Wash. Adjust dilution ratio in accordance with season.http://www.halfords.com/motoring/engine-oils-fluids/screenwash-de-icer/autoglym-ultimate-screenwash-500ml
"Thanks for the tips, will give them all a try.Like Snowman says above, a lot of it seems internal.When I'm driving in the dark to work, seem to get a constant filmly look out of rear window, like a piece of bad clingfilm has been spread across window.Opening back windows doesn't help, rear heated window doesn't, must be the inside of window, but clean that regularly with the microfibre.Annoying, as I usually spend around 18 minutes of my daily 20 minute commute trying to solve it !!!"
Sometimes cleaning products can leave a residue.
"I'm very wary of using cheap or low quality screen cleaner / additive these days. I've had hell's own problems with the lines clogging, especially the rear one. The length of tube to the back seems to really give problems after a couple of years and its a hell of a job to clear properly. Don't skimp!"
"I thought I would hate hate hate the Q8, but actually, I think it might be something I look at in a couple of years."
Just meandering through some insurance websites and wondering whether I need to tick the breakdown cover box.

"Audi UK extended warranty, however, does not come with an option for roadside assistance ????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
It's not part of the warranty nor does it extend if you buy the extended warranty option. AUK will call you as you get close to the end and ask if you want to extended the road cover however...
"Hi guys,New to the forum. I am on the lookout for a used Q5 to replace my existing Ford Edge. I have been looking for low mileage 2012-2015 models. Preferably the Premium Plus Quattro. I have been trying to find information on the interior differences with the different years. To me, they look pretty identical. Also, when did Audi start to add the Banger and Olufson stereos to the Q5's and what models?Thanks for the info ahead of time!Chris"
"Given the Premium Plus term used I assume you are a North American based member.B&O always been an option in UK/Europe, Nappa leather with sports seats standard in S model cars but was not included as standard in US spec vehicles apart from SQ5 Ithink. US cars had the Rear Bench Seat Plus as standard (moves to increase/decrease rear legroom/boot(trunk) capacity. All the US models I have seen have had wood trim fillets rather than Aluminium but assume that other inserts including Piano Black & Carbon are available. I think PP spec cars have electric seats, not standard in Europe."
"Hi, is it better shifting to neutral during stops and heavy traffic? Meaning is maintenance cost higher by just leaving the car on drive and using the brake pedal versus shifting to neutral? BTW I have a 7spd S-Tronic Transmission.When do I just leave it on drive and use brake pedal? 3min stops? 5min stops? Just concerned on clutch wear and tear vs. other parts. Thanks!"
Surely that's what stop/start is for?
"First thing I'll be doing when I get mine is to disable the stop/start. Hateful thing.As for the OP, just leave it in drive with your foot on the pedal. If you're stuck for a while then handbrake and neutral (or park) just to save your left leg.There's no clutch in an auto - there is a torque converter but it's designed to be pushing against a stationary motor so don't fret it."
"Use the electronic hand brake, keep foot off the footbrake and don't dazzle the person behind you."
Or engage Hill Hold Assist if you have it!
Hill Hold Assist Rules !!You can only disable the stop/start on a trip by trip basis.Unless you get delve into the software and know what you're doing.
Why would you want to turn off a fuel saving feature?
"Great thing about all these things - if you want to turn it off or not, engage it or not, you can choose to do so.on the hold assist, the brake light on my car stays on when you release the pedal. I don't recall what the Q5 does... but i wouldn't expect it to be different."
"First off, because I don't believe it saves more than a thimble full per year.Next because when I want to go, I want to go and not wait for the engine to start.But mostly because the wear on the starter and even the engine constantly being stopped and started is going to work out far more costly than those thimbles of fuel saved.I believe that stop/start is nothing more than a sop to EU regulations, and I don't think it does anything for us motorists.All IMO, of course!"
"skotl said:First off, because I don't believe it saves more than a thimble full per year.Next because when I want to go, I want to go and not wait for the engine to start.But mostly because the wear on the starter and even the engine constantly being stopped and started is going to work out far more costly than those thimbles of fuel saved.I believe that stop/start is nothing more than a sop to EU regulations, and I don't think it does anything for us motorists.All IMO, of course!Click to expand...Agree with that."
If your waiting for your car to start with stop start there must be something wrong with it.
Agree.I get annoyed when you crawl too short a distance forward for the start/stop to kick in. I will if I know I wont be moving for a while put in in neutral in these situations. It will also not engage if just started / engine is cold.
"It can stop just when you are getting ready to go though, that split second can make a difference.I hate it, it's there purely to massage the emissions levels IMO and does nothing good as far as wear and tear is concerned. If I'm ever in a queue for any length of time I'm quite happy switching off the old fashioned way, mind you, when it comes to cars I dislike almost every form of automated system."
They could just put a cheat device in for the emissions test and.... oh wait... D'oh
"Mine never cuts in, I do not keep my foot on the brake long enough. I do have HHA."
"I've got HHA as well but the stop start (when I've forgotten to switch it off) cuts in quite quickly. It seems pointless in that you come to a halt with foot on the brake, the engine turns off but will restart as soon as you release the pedal, even when stationary in a queue with HHA activated. It would make more sense - to me anyway - if it cut in after a longer stationary period, say 20 seconds and the restart was linked to the throttle instead of the brake.Keep meaning to get it coded so it defaults to off."
"I agree it should only turn on when you press the accelerator, my friends Alltrack works that way.I only hold the break long enough for the HHA to kick in, I am not conscious of doing this and it is very rare I have had start stop kick in."
"This is what the R8 does, you can release all the pedals and the car starts when you press the accelerator to move off."
"20 seconds is too long. It's fine as it is. But I agree that the engine switching back on should be linked to the throttle pedal, so you don't have to keep your foot on the brake pedal."
I had a golf hire car a while back 64 plate and it did the re start when pressing accelerator

"Whats so special about sq5 plus sport differential, had shot of one today, did not notice any difference from my sq5 without sports diff.Cheers"
"It's all subjective, but i agree with you...However heres audis version.."
"It looks good on you tube,bet it costs a fortune to retrofit.."
Was is set to dynamic? You don't really notice it until you're going that bit quicker on the twisty stuff. I seem to be in the minority but FWIW I think it's brilliant and it's now at the top of my 'must have' list for any future purchase. Should be a hoot in the snow.Apparently it will be available on the more powerful Mk2 4x4 Q5s when they eventually get released.Costs from about £650 (on the old A5 anyway) upwards but I agree it would be very expensive to retrofit.
"Yes it was, driven by two RS6 guys, I don't think I would bother retrofitting, happy with my normal sq5."
"Thanks for advice, knew I would be in for a bit of banter! I will only pimp a little bit, honest.Interesting comment on gearbox and will certainly read up on it. Would you suggest it is sensible to go for a manual at 75k+ mileage then?"
"I'd say hang on. The used prices are heading downwards quickly and once the new model hits the road that will only accelerate and allow you more options.Rear camera is not an option on the older models however.Face lift model is better for sure, look for the Diesel and go for a min of the 177bhp engine."
I would look for an auto. The auto box is very good and most cars will not suffer failure. However it is best to be aware that it is expensive item to repair.At 75K a manual may well have similarly expensive issues with syncromesh and / or clutch. As you may be aware(?) the dual mass flywheel often requires replacement in older BMWs and that is expensive.
newbie on here so don't take my word over others but think you will need one of these for connector:http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/like/152095057534?lpid=122&chn=ps&adgroupid=33676502101&rlsatarget=pla-271883402795&adtype=pla&poi=&googleloc=9044903&device=c&campaignid=707291931&crdt=0And would be amazed if your seat belt thing affected any sensors.

"True, but if you get the new one for a good price selling the old one to WBAC (if you're struggling privately) wouldn't be such a bitter pill.Good point, they're going to run out sooner rather than later I'd imagine."
You could chip the 30TDi for much less - just saying.
"The Mrs has got a brand new A4 Avant, I'm not sure I could live with that repulsive new dash which is exactly the one that's going in the new Q5. It's awful, really cheap and tacky and looks very much like the design department missed it off then added it at the last minute."
"Also, at the back of my mind is they may do a run out model SQ5 before the new one comes in, not guaranteed, but they often do this to use up the parts. Maybe more wishful thinking!"

You mean the existing one surely - not the new?New one looks great.
16 plate. The one with the iPad type screen sticking out of the dash - it looks terrible.
"Will be 17 plate on the roads in UK won't it ??Anyway, agree with Snow Man, that the new overall interior is improved, updated....EXCEPT for that stick on pad, it looks flimsy !!They didn't make it retractable because of the added cost of the small motors/ moving parts etc.. citing that it would always be in use anyway.But in my mind, it SHOULD be retractable (better still to have been moulded into the dash by design somehow, but too late for that now)Is it retractable on the Q7, I believe it is, but not 100% on that ??"
"Agree 100%, if they had designed the instrument binnacle properly like Porsche (really nice combo of analogue and digital), maybe even stolen Bentley's idea in mirroring the 2 sides of the cockpit (looks superb), it would be so much classier.What makes it even worse is that they are all part of the VWA group. They obviously need to to save a few bob so they should bin the Audi 'designers' and internally transfer some of the other talent who don't rely so heavily on rulers.I genuinely think I could have designed that dash better, despite not even studying O grade art."
"it is retractable, button is on the far right."

"LOL, actually I never use the auto button, the one in my A4 is either too hot or too cold, think a sensor's probably goosed, so I've got in the habit of turning the temp and fan up and down the old fashioned way, I'll maybe try it in the SQ."
"Agreed.And /or insurance in case of an accident probably, unless you inform them of course.Never really understood why anyone would mess with a new, pretty perfect engine."
"Must be some fancy roads about with no speed cameras, certainly not beside me!My sq5 must be super fast!, because I don't need it.Bye bye warranty!Three reasons above why I would not re-map."
"I'm with everyone else - I doubt Audi will honour the warranty on either engine or transmission if it's been remapped.Insurance is pretty black-and-white in that you need to tell them, and I'm sure you will be, but I certainly wouldn't do it with a brand new car.I suspect that, like TVs and washing machines, if a car is going to fail then it's pretty likely to do so in the first few months of ownership."
Issues to be concerned about that I have experiencedIntake Flap sticking causing the EGR cooler to fail (both replaced under warrenty.Service it correctly and regularly and it should be fine but just be aware components can and do fail from time to time.I had warrenty work on my old S3 and it had a Revo map on but I think they are more clued up and are certainly looking for mods more actively now.
"The BiT engine has issues with the outlet manifold sticking and you go into limp mode.It gets replaced under warranty without issues, but a remap will mean this ends up costing you."
I had an issue with a flat in the inlet manifold sticking on my SQ5.
Inlet manifold
had mine remapped last year...you wouldnt know it had been done bar the extra performance....some ridic points being put forward re its got enough power already...plenty 500bhp cars are remapped to 600...all personal preferences.
Is anyone looking at ordering the all new one yet? Or has anyone actually done the deed and got it on order?I've been negotiating for the past week with a couple of dealers and even looking at other cars (but heart is still with the Q5!).I've had my current Q5 for almost 4 years and been an Audi customer for 16 years but they're not that keen on rewarding loyalty.I've managed to get a 7% discount at the moment which was only after I saw an advert an autocar magazine today. Yesterday I was at 5%. How does this compare to anyone else looking at the new one?Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Not currently considering the new Q5.
"Nope,Want to see what this new Mexican production plant is actually producing first,Then see how they sell in UK, see if any glitches, and then test drive it myself.Will be a long process before I'm convinced, particularly as I can't fault my current model"
I have one on order - build week 7
"I still haven't done anything, still debating whether to order an S4 Avant for March delivery or wait and pay the higher VED rates when the higher powered Q5 versions launchMy SA did email me informing me that Audi will be raising prices on January 12th 2017 (didn't know if new Q5 was exempt as its only just been priced) but did advise that confirmed orders prior to 12th would be price protected"
I'm not sold no the external looks and the engines just are not where id want to be.but I'm running out of time to find a replacement for the SQ.
"I drive a 2015 Q5 3.0 TDI.LOVEthe looks! Amazing engine does 0-60mph in 6.4 sec, and if treated gently, can get 51.8 US MPG (62.2 UK MPG, 4.54 L/100km). Love the car.The redo leaves me cold :-( If I was forced to get a new vehicle today, I'd be searching for a used 2015 3.0 TDI. I love it that much. Second choice would be the new Mercedes GLC SUV."
"Here! I've owned 4 BMWs, the longest held being a '97 328 cab for 18 years. I got it just before the model change. Didn't care for the new look. And the ""Flame Surface"" era was a dark time in BMW's history (in my mind).As with my BMW 328, I'm super happy I got what I got with my 2015 Q5. To my eyes, it looks gorgeous. The new Q5 looks like a VW to me :-("
"well generally the design with VAG goes backwards, the old Q5 look like the new Toerag, the old passat looks like the new skoda, i guess its cheaper this way... pass on a successful shape from higher in the brand downwards."
"I would suggest it may be more cynical marketing - pass down the ""old"" style to those that cannot afford to buy the new Audi <LOL>"
"I truly believe its just VAG are very lazy and are bereft of ideas.This approach makes it simpler/cheaper/easier for them. They don't appear to do it for all shapes, just the more successful ones."
Has anyone had any warranty issues once they had their car coded ?I am just about to get it done and the car is 2 weeks old and I didn't want any issues down the line.
had mine serviced while fully coded to the max with ADS added etc - came back exactly the same (but serviced!) with no issues.
"I think it would only be an issue when the modification caused or contributed to a failure.For example:If your ECU suffered a catastrophic failure, like being bricked by careless coding."
You're fine with this.You're not changing the performance or stress criteria on the car.
You might find that the new coding gets over-written back to standard if there is a software update applied during servicing.
Then What???
You re code it.
"Again this is really unlikely any updates are coming for the Q5 now,The platform hasn't changed for a while and the Q5 was the oldest version in the Audi range so nothing now remains to develop for."
"I'm not so sure. I have a mitsubhishi variant that is partial to a remap and they have had various software uptdates over the last few years to address recalls / safety issues, etc., that are prone for wiping the remap.Those who spent £400 on the remap had to go back and spend another £400 to get it done again.Not saying that thiswon'thappen on an Audi but I wouldn't be surprised if it did."
Don't know about anyone else but where I live there appears to be an incredibly large number of Q5's floating around. Can only assume that Audi are doing some great deals for the outgoing model?
Not noticed any increase in last 6 months
"I drove with a friend for around 13 hours last weekend (up, down and across Scotland) and, because much of the conversation was about my impending SQ5, we were on the lookout for any.We saw not a one - just a solitary Q5.As for great deals, mine topped out at £56k incl the options and we're paying £48k."
Someone else's money or yours eg. Finance or Cash?
half'n'half
"The 1st Gen Q5 is the best-selling vehicle in its class (mid-size luxury SUV) with about 1.5M examples made. Once you get one, or plan to get one, your reticular activating system gets ""tuned in"" to seeing them, so you notice them more."
"i was going to wait for the new model but the deal on outgoing one was too good, swapped our old 2014 14 Q5 S line Plus 150bhp manual for a brand new 66 plate 190 bhp S line plus auto with £1500 of options for no additional money down and £30 per month less, only put £2k down on original 14 plate car as well, to me it was a no brainer, salesman did explain that new car had no deals and s line model wasn't as well specced as outgoing car (had to pay to upgrade to full leather etc)."
Just purchased a 2010 Q5 Prestige S-Line that only came with one key fob. Can I purchase two key fobs that have already been programmed to another Q5? Or are they a one and done with Audi system. Not really wanting to pay $230 per key fob and $100 for programming (STEALERSHIP) quoted prices...
36 views and no one can answer my question! lol
"I believe you would need a dealer to recode them ""if"" he wanted to.The old style keys were pretty easy but i dont believe you can do it yourself anymore AND the key would need to fit the lock."
Hi looking for someone to put ADS on my car (1 week old) did not spec !!!Im in Cambridge but can travel within reason to most placesany helpers
I'm near Norwich and could do this for you (just successfully activated mine....)Not exactly next door I know but.....Russ
Sounds good Russ I did PM you
What VCDS did you activate?
So you did - and I didn't spot it!Most forums usually send an email if a PM has arrived. Is that something I can set up or not a feature of this forums software?I'll reply to your PM shortly - apologies for the delay.Russ
"Not quite sure what you're asking.I used VCDS to set up ADS in my car which didn't have this feature.There is some coding to be done and some changes to the ""green menu"" but not too difficult.You access the options via the MMI not a dedicated button.Russ"

Sports Mode addict?​Can you last a full fill up without using Sports Mode?Yes - I can resist the demon mode318.75%No - Its just too damn addictive1381.25%
I can't manage a day without putting into dynamic mode ok sometimes I change out of sport mode but only cause I have drive select so get the noise but still use sports mode more than I probably should
"Yes, very easily resisted, in fact never used except by mistake ... but then I don't have an SQ5 :-(My 190 horses are more than enough to get me into trouble on the country lanes as it is !!!"
"I went to my local dealer today and looked at the current shape q5 s-line plus 190 s-Tronic, figuring that they might be giving them away.They gave me a quote of 13.5% off ( including dealer contribution ) + £3.5k deposit for me, over 48 months...£432 per month at 6.2% Apr. How does that work ?£40k car, less £8.9k = £31.1k. £432 X 47 = £20.3k.Ok, so there's interest to pay but are they really valuing the car at around £11k in 4 years ? That's 28% residual - does that sound right ?A quick internet search shows 2-3 year personal leasing from around £335 upwards with £3k down."
"I don't know much about PCPs, but ignore the maths above, it contains probably 6k or even more of interest payments.What's the to buy or final price for the car? That will give you a better indication."
"I didn't get that far as I said he was miles out and I had a family do to attend so couldn't stay for more than an hour. When I was in the showroom, he said ""£300-£350"" then came back with £432 on the phone later"
"I've had put down a similar deposit on mine 2 years ago 8.5k including dealership contributions with gap, dent/scratch removal and tyre protection thrown in over 48 months paying £343pm. GFV £20500.This was a factory order."
I presume this is with no options otherwise that is not a very good deal.
Just with black pack ( not the extended one )
"So, the dealer has come back with a GFV of £19.3k. They appear to have offered for a new car that they have in stock which has much more on it than we want and said that there are no cars in black or white with a black styling pack on.Seems unlikely to me...Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Your monthly payments are way too much. It maybe a simple reason because of the expensive options already speced up. If you don't want those options why pay for them? You don't get any more money for having more options when you px.
"Damian from someone who currently owns a 10 month old Q5 with all the bells and whistle you would need the depreciation is huge. I would really stress that you find the right car, and right spec you require. As others have said no matter what options you go for it means diddly squat at the time of sale."
"You're both right of course. He's seeing if he can do the car ""as if it doesn't have the options we don't want"".My deposit + dealer contribution is £6k. Interest charges are £6100.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Have you triedwww.carwow.co.uk? I don't have any affiliation with them but I know my dealer is terrified of any customers going to look at them.
21's and black pack!
"Thanks, what do you get with the black pack?"
"Mines got gloss black grill, fog light surrounds, roof rails are Matt black then spoiler and door mirrors are also gloss but think that's a plus thing!"
Forgot about the rear diffuser mines monsoon grey so the black looks great in it. Wasn't keen on black car with black pack it looses its look but that's just my opinion
Steps would help with 21s and keeping the chrome
Side steps help the look
You could try a Q5 Caractere kit.
"I can't have the side steps as I have pano roof, seems ridic but anyways, they would help with the look and I did want them.Alloys would make a big difference I reckon and a bit of wrapping here and there.Has anyone seen an estoril with black pack?"
"You can have steps and a pan roof as long as you don't have a towbar? That's if ordering new, I can't see there being a problem retrofitting?"
SQ5 grill is different though and believe those wheels are 20's don't think black grill and rest chrome would be that nice but thats just my thoughts.You deffo need the 21's and again my preference is the titanium as you can spec or could spec a standard Q5 with the 21's but in black only so SQ5 is the only one to get titanium wheels
What's the link between steps and pano roof?
"Audi won't allow you to add all 3 options - steps, pano and tow bar due to excessive weight..."
"21"" wheels.See how you feel. If it needs more try steps (running boards) after that.As MrH said that blue might not be the best match for BP."
Its all very well having a whizzo flash looking gearknob made of billet aluminium but when its minus 5C outside it feels like my fingers are going to stick to the bloody thing every time I touch it!Looks like I'll have to buy some string backed driving gloves (not).My wife has offered to knit a little egg cosy cover....Russ
Steering wheel is also cold.
Seatbelt?The HHA goes off if you try and drive without the seatbelt on.
"Cheers,Could be but I usually start the engine before putting the seatbelt on.I'll try putting the belt on first and see what happens."
"LOL, no doubt, but come on Raphster you're the technical whiz - does your radio scroll from the wheel and does your HHA stay where you left it?"
HHA stays where I left it - yes.Radio scroll from the wheel - yes on dash not MMI.
The left hand thumbwheel on the steering wheel scrolls the DIS content and the rotary knob on the console scrolls the MMI screen. they are not interconnected.HHA should return to the position it was in before the ignition was turned off. However thats what it said for my B8 RS4 but that went to default off every time!
"Cheers guys, weird though, in my A4 the left thumbwheel scrolls the radio channels on the MMI and DIS and I could have sworn the SQ was the same, maybe I am loosing my marbles.The HHA is more annoying though, I'll just have to try and remember to switch it on when I'm switching S/S off."
I dont have to switch mine on everytime..
If you switch on the ignition before putting your seatbelt on then HHA is automatically disabled. So appears your car is functioning as it should.
"Dear all,Apologies if this has been asked before. I'm trying to buy a decent used Q5, and the best one I have found that ticks all the boxes is a local, late 2014 manual with a 150bhp engine.Im coming out of a 177bhp A4 which has enough power for me. I've driven the 150 and found it a bit flat, also driven a 3.0 and loved the power - but not an auto fan.Question - is the audio 150bhp and 177bhp the same engine tuned differently, or are they physically different?And.... has anyone chipped a Q5 with great success - and if so which chip please?Basically want to buy the 150, but want to make it at least the same as my 177 A4 - if that makes any sense. Help!Any constructive advice really appreciated. Thanks"
"I am sure you could chip the 150 (143PS), but I would suggest you would be better looking for one with higher power output."
"Far too under powered for the Q5, at a min you need to be looking towards the 190, that will chip to about 230.However id be looking towards the 3.0ltr"
Has anyone out there used Superchips +/- the Bluefin on a 150 bhp Q5.Stats and mapping show performance equal to a 177.....thoughts? Experiences please...
Didn't we just have this thread below?
In a way yes - but specifically looking at the Superchips now - hence the more specific post.
"Just seems mad to me, to buy an what you already know is an underpowered 150 ps Q5, when there's thousands of 177, 190, 245s out there for sale.There must be some that meet your requirements surely"
Your local dealer should be able to find a car that ticks every box even if they need to get a car from elsewhere in the country. If they want your money they will work for it!
"I pick my SQ5 plus up on Saturday, what is the recommended engine running in period ?"
They do go into detail in the user manual. But from personal experience around 2000 miles before you can start using sports mode and start ripping it. But even then I took it easy till 5k. Now mined nicely loosened up. Funny thing is that even on 11k the car keeps on getting better economy.
Audi run the engine at high speed from cold at the factory as part of the QA....So don't bother; just drive it like you stole it. But let the oil get warm first!
Im glad you said that Snow Man thats what I have been waiting 3 months for
"I'm on-side withDermu, who recommends reading the user manual and following it. Good advice."
I'm with Snow Man here - enjoy it from day 1!
I test drive an un registered car and was told to drive it like I stole it it had 3 miles on the clock. Engines are run in before you get the car these days but I let mine get warm before giving it any beans. As the temp gauge goes up my foot goes further down!
"I drove sensibly for 500 miles, tried to do 500 more - but failed."
I tried to do 1000.

Love the forum as it is - if it aint broke don't fix it.
Can't beat a bit of pointless banter IMO.
I agree
"I was about to post an article about my faulty cam shaft sensor and how it causes my car to drive like a brick, and it also shows up an a n engine timing sensor fail, audi offered t o fix the problem at about £2k but my local guy will do both sensors for less than £400 in readies.Audi well done, it drives like Bentley and drinks like a roller! looses power at 1500 to 200 revs in first and second gear and vibrates like ann summers on a rubble strip at up to 50MPH."
"Site is good you can find most of what you want on here, most stuff I google for SQ5/q5 comes up with myaudiq5 links or now I've started using the search within the forum. I try not to post too much if I don't know what the answer is or have any input why write a message just more rubbish you need to scroll past!"
"Just not enough people who own Q5s visit the boards.It's all mums on school runs and people who have no real interest in cars owning Q5. It's Audi best seller, but yet no traffic/footfall.Look at the A5 and you see far more chat and involvement. No sure how you change that..."
"It can get quiet on here at times, but for me, there's just about enough posting to keep it interesting.I'm hoping, from this to forum, to slowly get a decent cross-section of thoughts and comments on the new up-coming Q5.We're only a tiny cross-section of course, but I'm already getting a feeling of slight general disappointment with what we've seen so far of the new model. I'm in that camp myself so far.No disrespect to those posters who have ordered one, (not sure how many that is ?)I admire your courage to do so without even a test drive, and eagerly await your opinions on them."
"This always happens when a new model comes out, existing owner are generally dismissive.It's like a self protection mechanism. It's just bizarre and you see it everywhere. I'm surprised Audi actually sell any new models these days!"

"Audi could have just used the last model, updated the interior/dash, added sweeping indicators front and back, and it would have been good to go!"
"Yeah but the grill was fine (in black only), new one looks wrong-ish. Maybe it will grow on me when I see it in the flesh."
"No, black pack/grill never worked, looks like cheap plastic you'd expect on a shitron.Could be worse - have you seen the RS TT with the ""aluminium pack"" OMG, thats nasty and the price makes me laugh everytime i see it!"
"Did you miss the completely different sheetmetal? So we have:New grillNew headlights and taillightsNew body stylingNew interiorAnd not visible, we have new underpinning and new electronics.I'd have to say this is a totally new car, as opposed to just making a few changes here and there."
"Except for the iPod I quite like the look of it, a sporty version with torsen, BP and more aggresive stance should be a cracker. When the end of line Mk2 SQ5 plus SE makes an appearance I may be about ready to change, probably to a Macan though!"

look forward to the completion picture
Use the same stuff myself.

"Once Dynamic selected, gearbox automatically goes into Sport mode. You will see the gear indicator in the DIS change from the previously selected mode (D or E) to S."
It will start in last known setting but if in dynamic and you put to Drive it will stay in Drive until you tell it to use Sport.If you were in a different setting as soon as you select dynamic it will select sport
Only on newer cars. So you will be fine.

Interesting pros and cons I can't comment until I collect my plus in October
Great thanks.I love the washing machine quote.Rappy.
"Would also like to know the procedure for this. I always plan to replace the bulbs, but will probably only do it when one dies first.But I would say the SQ is an amazing car and there is nothing quite like it on the road. also see myself keeping this car for a long time."
"SteveMcB said:Haha, don't worry it's a great car, you won't be disappointed. Macan and FPace were on my short list but bang for buck I found the SQ5 plus impossible to beat. I ordered one before they were released and have not been disappointed.DittoPros:Performance - It is rapid, certainly more than quick enough for our roads, smooth delivery with no throttle delay or flat spots. Slick gearbox.DittoHandling - I've not had the opportunity to really push an SQ5 so can't comment on how they handle but with the sports diff on the plus it corners like it's on rails. I could go on about the diff all day, it's witchcraft how it pushes the car tighter into the corner and impresses me every time I drive it. Zero understeer, from the driver's perspective one of the car's best features. Brakes on mine seem fine, never had a hint of fade.DittoLooks - extended black pack IMO looks better than chrome on most colours and sets the car off. It'll contrast well with the white.Ditto with SepangCabin - very, very nice place to be, diamond seats look the part and are very comfortable ( can sometimes feel a bit too warm though). Good quality materials used throughout, the piano black trim on mine is nice although some have commented that the aluminium is a bit fragile. Clear, intuitive, instrument panel and switch gear. I've not noticed any cheap looking bits except for the foot rest which I replaced.Mostly ditto although I detest the aluminium look (but actually plastic) steering wheel gear selectors. They feel horribly cheap.Exhaust - obviously fake but a nice sound none the less. I put a kufatec on mine but probably should have saved my money.No Kaufatec for me.Towbar - if you've got it - is very neat and surprisingly cheap.Got and fully agree.ConsSpare wheel - none! I was told the collapsible was no longer supplied as standard to keep weight and emissions down. I found that explanation even less believable after the scandal broke. They can still be fitted under the boot floor but are approx £500 new.""Transferred"" from my earlier SQ5.Headlights - not really a 'con' as such but agree they could be better, the bulbs can be upgraded though. It would have been nice to have an LED option.Indifferent.Connect - not 4g compatible but seems to work fine on 3g.Agreed.Fuel consumption - heavier than figures suggest ( no surprise there though) but I can average 30+ without restraining myself too much. Easy to get into the 20s. I think adblue consumption might be on the heavy side as well.Averaging about 38mpg with occasional heavy right foot.Wheels - choice far too limited, very subjective but IMO the grey/diamond are a bit boring and the black/diamond a bit OTT. Style is OK but RS6 style would look better.Black / diamond ok with me.Deceptively fast - probably should be a 'pro' but it always seems to be going quicker than I think it is. I've set up the DIS to show the large digital speedo.Ditto x 10Door mirrors - too big, cause blindspots at roundabouts but you get used to it.DittoSunglasses holder and under seat storage - far too small, a complete joke.+1The cons are all pretty minor though, it's a great all rounder ( there's not many cars that can take a washing machine from 0-60 in 5 secs).Certainly the best car I've owned.3rd Q5 for me so tendency to agree.Click to expand..."
When did you order? Luckily my dealer found a cancelled order from June and managed to amend the spec to my requirements so ordered 1 week ago and should get the car end of October which is still killing me having to wait I just want it now especially after the test drive then having to get back in my tractor of a Tiguan!
A few weeks ago so should be December
"The adjustment for the headlights is just an allen key if i remember.sure at the time people said you couldnt do it as they were self levelling but i did with help from google i think or maybe somewhere on here?Was only a couple of turns on each side but it made just enough difference,before there was a definate cut off point just short of where i thought it should be but after it was enough to see another 10 foot or so and never been flashed by any oncoming traffic."
I've given up on sunglasses holders. The one in the Tiguan is just as small and useless. Maybe when it was designed they used kids sunglasses! I now keep them in the case in door pocket as others have said
"Im not at home this week so cant check but white plastic adjustment part rings a bell.i did mine againt the back wall of my garage using a pencil line to determine if i was going correct way just did a little at a time and counted the turns and did same amount for both sides.dont recall meeting any resistance or it being tight,maybe you are at the end of your range?"
"Outdated suspension (why no adaptive dampers on any SQ ever?)Woefully poor front brakes, the SQ5 out performs the stoppers with very little effort (the setup from the RSQ3 would transform)Headlights very average for XenonsYeah the styling is dated but the design is at the end of it's life now."
Just had my 1st service at 18.5k and apparently the front pads have 8mm left and the rears 4mm so it seems (maybe) more braking effort is going to the rear? The Audi service manager could offer no explanation ......................
hand brake turns?
Hill hold assist not disengaging fully or slowly?
"SteveMcB said:Only wear the Edna's on special occasions, day to day I select from the rest of my collection, Polaroid Oakley Crosshairs x2, Rayban Aviator (chromax), Serengeti somethings and a few cheapos - ( I like shades) - none of them come close to fitting in that holder so they have to live in the door pocket.Had my eyes lasered a couple of weeks ago because the left was getting a bit weak at night, could probably have fitted my old monocle in there I supposeMy napper size falls into the average category, I'm assuming yours does too so what's your secret?You're not rocking those 'trendy' folding ones are you.Click to expand...My Rayban Aviators fit just fine, just put them in with lenses facing up, roll through 90 degrees as they go in to the holder so lenses face forward and Bob's your uncle. Oakley Frogskins and Holbrook also fit no problem at all."
"My raybans are over 20 yrs old, the ones with a browbar, they actually do go in with the right technique but are very tight and a fiddle to get out when driving. I wear the Oakley Crosshairs day to day though and unfortunately they are nowhere near fitting. Plenty of room in the door pockets though."
"Best thing for me is the speed/sound and worst thing right now is the paintwork!I adjusted the lights on mine straight away, I've had to do this with the last 3 cars I have had - all set dangerously low.I can get my glasses in the sunglasses holder no probs too"
Can you remember which way you turned the adjuster and roughly how much?
"I parked the car in front of my garage door when it was getting dark, turned the lights on, turned the adjuster to the right a quarter turn, watched the light lift slowly on the garage door and adjusted another quarter turn and so on until I thought it was about right. Hope that helps."
"Exactly what i said previously,just count the turns and do same number on both sides,if they started level they will still be level."
"The worst are the xenon head lights, compared to my BMW 435d there absolute rubbish, the best thing is after over 3 years ownership I still love it for its looks and driving pleasure. Its replacement has got stiff competition ( either MERC GLC COUPE or new SQ5 ) when it comes out in a year or so ????"
"It's pretty obvious if they are too low, I always do an night time drive as soon as a get a car to check the lights."
Just thought of another positive - no iPad sticking out of the dash.

"vinny said:I adjusted mine up a touch and it made a big difference,maybe they are slightly set low from the factory.I was discussing replacement last week as my sq was 2 years old on 5/9/16 and came to the conclusion I was glad I took the 4th year audi warranty at time of purchase as currently there is nothing else I like or comes close the the all round ability of the sq for £50k ish.Unknown for me to keep a new car longer than 30 months but can honestly see me having this one until the 4 yr warranty runs out.Models from Porsche,bmw,merc,jaguar etc honestly do nothing for me in my list of must haves (diesel,4x4,£50k-ish incl options,sub 6 sec 0-60,)if anybody can think of something that ticks all those boxes let me know!Dont worry the positives far outweigh the negativesClick to expand...Can anyone supply a quick beginners guide on how to adjust the headlights?Full beam seems to throw decent light but on dipped headlights, night vision is just pants.I'd like to be able to raise the beam by about 10% or so, just to get another 20 yards or so of better illumination.Advice appreciated therefore.Cheers."
"I was meaning to come back and report my finding sooner, but I have been busy recently. I adjusted my beams slightly up, and the light output is still cr@p! It does not improve things. Need more light output (Lux)!"
"Not touched mine yet, the levels seem fine though it's just that they aren't bright enough, a new set of decent bulbs would probably sort it but they are expensive and awkward looking to fit. I still intend doing it at some point though."
I didnt increase the brightness but by raising them a tad i was able to see an extra 10-15 feet of the road ahead as the cut off line of the beam wasnt far enough for me meaning i can go that bit quicker now as can see more of the road ahead
"What type of Diesel do you run your SQ5 on?... Ultimate/Premium or Standard?I normally use the Standard Diesel, however I have used Ultimate Diesel for the last two fills, but didn't feel or notice any real difference in performance or MPG.Over the longer term, I appreciate that the engine internals will benefit from the Ultimate fuel.My weekday journeys tend to be short (6-mile) trips, with longer trips over the weekend.During the shorter trips, I tend to use 'sport' mode to keep the revs higher and hopefully help warm the engine up as quickly as possible.What are your views/experience on this?"
"It's just a placebo, the only time those fuels make a difference is if you have a choked up engine.We use it once a month just to keep it all clean."
"I give it a treat every 3 or 4 tanks, don't notice any difference in performance/consumption though."
"All we have is one kind of diesel here in the GWN (Great White North, AKA Canada). My 2015 3.0 TDI is a record setter for high fuel economy in its class... providing I drive it gently. Over 22,000 miles, no issues, and great fuel economy (see my Fuelly log, and individual road trips to the US where I've exceeded 52 MPG US!)-Steve"
"I try to use every now and then. I do notice increased MPG when using premium, but you have to drive sensibly to get the benefit."
Thanks for your replies.Think I will just stick with filling up with the Regular Diesel.
"I don't think we've put deluxe diesel in ours, I know the Mrs who has filled it up a few times in the last 3 1/2 years wouldn't entertain such a thought"
Missile she probably does but why bother when you have a man to do it for you!
My wife wouldn't even know there are different types of petrol and diesel! After 6 years of diesel cars she still says have you put petrol in and when I correct her she says I'm not stupid James!
"My better half does fuel the cars, putting petrol in the Golf tdi wasn't one of her finer moments though. She was on her way to work so I had to swap cars and wait in the busy forecourt for the man with the tank sooker to do his thing.It was good of her to leave me to take the head shaking and red face, should have put a sign up naming the real culprit."
"Looking at putting in some rear dvd players, headrest ones look good but when fitted are they angled too much upwards?Thanks Dave"
We've used Nextbase ones for years without issue.The fixing bracket (unit to headrest) is adjustable and the screen view is fine - both for junior passengers in car seats or taller / older ones.
"Thanks Raphster, yes ive got this set up myself but was looking for something as a permanent job. My only worry with the headrest type is the angle and height at which the screens are visable as my feelings are without seeing any installed is that the screens could be tilted upwards as the natural fit of a headrest is."
This would sort it:https://www.nextbase.co.uk/dvdplayers/stanchion-mount-click-go-series/Has a tilt ball at the back to adjust viewing angle.
Thanks for the link not sure I like those ones though might have to stick with the ipad.

Does any one know when the new Q5 will be in the show rooms. Has any one actually ordered one before seeing them?It would be really useful to know if any dealership has actually given a discount or are they all sticking to the same line - new model no chance!
This says Spring 2017http://www.theweek.co.uk/77139/audi-q5-2017-prices-specs-and-reviews
"It was suggested to me that if I order now, I can have one for March delivery."
"i think they'll have demo models in the showrooms well before they're actually y available to the public, so they can fill the order books"
you would hope so
"YapStar said:Hi all,I don't have a list but some happening this month, I'm going to the one at Coulsdon on the 26th November. Worth speaking to your local dealer to see if they are getting it in.With regards to discount it depends on dealer, over the last few weeks I've called a few and they were pretty adamant because it's a new model etc that there would be no discounts.Lo and behold it appears on Carwow and already I've received a range of discounts from 0% - 5.5%. I think there might be an opportunity that it might get around to 6-8% with Orangewheels etc very shortly.I assume this will be maximum level of discount for a while which would be in line with GLC etc after a year. Last thing Audi want to do is devalue the car against it's competitors at these early stages.Will I be ordering one, yes I'm going to take a chance on it, as coming out of PCP on an Audi and need something bigger. Fingers crossed!Hope that helps.CheersClick to expand...Thanks for the update, very useful info."
I ordered my first Q5 long before the first demo model was in UK showrooms.
"Well, I realise that's possible, you can order them now no doubt.But original question was when will they be hitting the showrooms, and i reckon it will be pretty soon as more people will order it when they've seen it in the flesh and maybe had a test drive.I wouldn't spend £40-odd-k without a good run out first.to be honest, the simple answer for original poster is to drive to nearest Audi dealership and say""Excuse me, when will you be getting the new Q5 in your showroom"""
I am prepared to run the risk.I have specced a model to suit my requirements and will be visiting my local showroom in the coming week.
"That's good, get in early, you obviously like what you've seen of them on the net in reviews etc.I'm not taken with it, from what I've seen so far, and don't like the new Q7I'm hoping though, that I'll get a pleasant surprise when seeing it up-close and personal.It's why I bought a late last model of first generation, so I have a good year to see how they are and make a decision to swap over or keep this one."
"I have the new Q5 brochure, Solid white and Black is not an option on the S line.Mythos Black is available.SE, Sport and S Line are the only options."
"Ransman said:The S-Line Plus is not an option and I certainly won't spend £800 for leather.Heated front seats seem to be standard on all modelsThe spec I am thinking of is as follows:Sport 2.0D S-tronicColour: Probably Manhattan Grey (shame no Daytona on this model)Technology Pack (probably)Virtual cockpitHHA (not on configurator)Bigger AdBlue tank - this is really taking the p*ss having to pay £50 for the privilegeFolding door mirrorsThat spec keeps below the magic £40k, assuming that delivery if not part of the equation.OK I will miss not having my current Adaptive Cruise and Pano Roof, but I can live without those. One option, however, might be to swap the Technology Pack for the Adaptive Cruise. I just need to think about that one.Click to expand...Not trying to be picky, but on the configurator I was on , they had HHA at £75, cos I remember thinking why the hell isn't this just standard, it's so good, why don't they just include it ??Other point, isn't it awful having to spec it at less than £40k , so not getting the machine you want, for having to pay the extra (considerable) road tax !!.Evil really, I know it's not even really the money but the principle.Everything points to my keeping my 2016 model for 3-4 years."
"The trouble is you sometimes get inconsistent information from dealers, perhaps it due to them wanting to shift old models? Or genuinely dont know. When my wife enquired about the mk3 TTR she spoke to two dealers one said they would have them in the shown room in 3 months time, the other dealer said at least 6 months, but surprise surprise he offered to give her a great deal on the out going TTR.Sometimes forum members have more insight into info behind the scenes and can enlighten members hence the initial post. News of pending deals would also be appreciated."
I was fortunate to take delivery of one of the very first Q5s in the UK. I hope you get one of the first new models too
"There is an inconsistency somewhere as I can find it on one the price lists but not the configurator I am using.Some of the ""options"" have increased considerably in price. RBS+ doubled in price from £175 to £350. I have it but can't think I have ever used it."
"The HHA is on the configurator under assistance systems priced at £75, I cannot find the 24l adblue option though."
Does any one know when the new Q5 will be in the show rooms. Has any one actually ordered one before seeing them?It would be really useful to know if any dealership has actually given a discount or are they all sticking to the same line - new model no chance!
Yes got it now. I can't find the AdBlue option on the configurator either
My Salesman said he's off somewhere (he did tell me ) next month for training and first drive of the Q5 and that they were expecting first Q5's in the dealership in late February / March.
Same with mine.
"Ordered one, but no delivery date yet."
"Hi Ransman,did you manage to get anything off the list price"
i've badgered my dealer asking him to ask Audi why heated outer rear seats which are a £300 option on the current Q5 are now a £1000 option on the new Q5.i'm not getting another Q5 if this is the kind of silly games Audi want to play.
"Hi JonathonThe dealer did say that this was generally a ""nil discount"" model at the moment but they did honour the standard discount I had previously negotiated. This is my fifth Q5."
Option 4A4 on the price list - £300 (Page 18)Edited: Just seen your post on the other thread - madness that it has to be combined with electric front seats.

"Not that I can see, and they may be being optimistic. I am happy as long as I have an agreed p/x and I have specced it at £39,975 at list so the VED is not an issue."
"Congrats on the new purchase, will be one of the first on the roads !Can you give us an idea of which model & what is included for that (rather good) price of just under £40k ?i.e. how does it compare to your current S-line plus, re: e.g Nav, leather, 20"" wheels, privacy glass etc ?"
"Ransman said:Hi SJWhen you look at the spec, you get quite a lot for your money compared to the previous Q5. I decided to go for the Sport model as you have to pay extra for leather on the S-line and, to be honest, the only thing that really appealed to me on the S-line was the privacy glass so it just didn't cut the mustard.

At least the 24l option should last for at least 7,000 miles according to my sums.Interesting that the standard capacity fuel tank has dropped from 75 to 65 litres, which I was a bit disappointed with until I realised that was approx the same % improvement in mpg so the range should be about the same. Let's hope that Audi are not pulling a fast one on this. Nobody will expect to get around 55mpg (unless you live in Canada of course) but the %age improvement would be worthwhile.At the end of the day I liked the press reports and I guess I am trusting VAG to do the right thing if any issues emerge.SteveClick to expand...Great spec chosen, these are exactly the options and model I would would choose.

"The New Q5 will be launched in the UK as a 2.0L Diesel and a 2.0TFSI Petrol S-tronic with Quattro-on-demandPricing for the 2.0TDi Quattro in SE trim will start at £37,170.00, with the top launch model being the 2.0TFSI S-Line at £41,040All models include 18"" Alloys, Parking plus, powered tailgate, heated front seats and smartphone interfaceSport adds sports seats with lumbar and SD navigationS-Line adds 19"" Alloys, LED Headlights, Leather / Alcantara sports seats and Privacy glass"
"Just priced up a new 2ltr S line diesel....tech pack, mem seats, pano roof and towbar....£49,640....that's more than I paid for my SQ5 with all the trimmings."
"Welcome to the new world...The R8 went epic on price at re-launch, the new TTRS is a complete joke price wise; but Audi are in a fight for their life and the new owners are going to have to pay for the wrongs/fines of diesel gate."
"TTRS at £51K is probably ok against a Cayman or whatever as the price now includes sat nav plus, virtual display, parking sensors Front and rear and s-tronic, however Audi need to sell the new Q5 in quantities and the fact that the 2.0 model with some choice options is £50K is going to make it difficult when a GLC43 is similar money"
I did the same and got to over £50K as I'd want the air suspension - haven't spoken to my dealer to find out if they're prepared to move on price or whether the Audi PCP contribution is valid on the new model
"I hope I am wrong, but I cannot see the dealers offering deals on the new model for some time. Had the same problem with my wife's TT roadster. We went to see our audi dealer when they first came out. I asked for a discount and he almost laughed me out of the shown room. We waited until just recently and got nearly £6k off the car. Even allowing for an additional £2k depreciation on our TT we still were nearly £4k better off by just waiting."
"I'm not so sure, got 10% off on our current SQ5 when the model was launched in Feb 2013, dealers need to sell cars and although the majority buy on PCP and only look at the monthly cost others look at whether the car actually looks sensibly priced against the competitionI'm wanting to avoid the VED hike next April so I'll be looking at the Mercedes GLC43 and maybe the Macan again, having already dismissed the F-Pace"
"I appreciate that technically the SQ5 was a new car then, but it was still based on the current Q5 that then had been around previously for about 5 years. Despite the similarities the new Q5 is really a new car so Audi will probably try to resist discounting. I really hope I am wrong and other forum members post details of deals/ discounts etc. Certainly the Mk3 TT was massively over priced at launch, so sales appeared slow hence the need for discounting. Hopefully prospective owners will think the same with the Q5. Unfortunately I think you are right others look at their monthly payments rather than how over priced a car appears and get one regardless."
"I would 'like' to think that the outrageous prices of the new model will stem the depreciation of our current model.That people will say ,'No, I'll pay £20k less and get a nearly new, classic, old model with the nicer shape'But it won't happen, the new ones will be bought like hotcakes, because people just have to have the latest brand, regardless,and our current cars will be old clunkers before Donald builds that wall!Human nature wins."
"re:Much desired price drops for the Second Generation Q5I believe this won't happen for some time, purely because it's a new model. The manufacturer will wait until they are very confident that the price jump is negatively affecting sales, and this might take several quarters until they conclude this, assuming it happens at all. As others have rightfully said, there's a huge market for people who just must have the ""latest and greatest."" I just don't know if there's enough of them who'll buy a Q5 and make Audi consider the product and related price a good match and a success. We'll see."
"Hi,Just noticed on the Audi configurator that 2.0 TFSI model is no longer available in UK? Dealer says noone knows why. Any idea if this is temporary or they just want to offload Diesels before the new model is out? Really annoying as back in september noone said it could happen.I test drove 2.0TDI and didn't like it. Maybe need to have another go as the Special Edition price is very good atm."
"[sup]Q5 is end of production now, so it makes sense the models are disappearing.[/sup]"
"Unless you want a run-out bargain, I'd wait for the new model now. Perhaps you can get a 3.0tdi or SQ5 for an excellent discount. I heard £45k mentioned for a fully loaded SQ5 now? That is a steal as I paid £40 for a 5 month old one with 3k on the clock last December.But note that when you come t sell innyears time, the newer model will be in much more demand. And, in a few months' time, when you're drving in your dated model and you see lots of the new model out there, you'll wish you'd bought the new one, I'll bet."
Looks like the new Q5 will be significantly more expensive and if the £ continues to fall ............The old model could be a bargain for those who don't feel the need to have the latest model which IMHO appears to be little more than a face lift.
"So, @madeinstein, my subjective opinion....The SQ5 is firmly spring, but not uncomfortably so. The critisism I would have is that some road surfaces can make it a little 'jiggly'.However, a smooth road is fine. And when I do my long continental trips on my winter-tyred 20"" wheels, it's a fantastic high-speed cruiser on the autobahns.I suggest you try one - on a variety of roads. And if you buy new, buy a spare set of 20s for the extra comfort. Keep the 21s in the garage for when you come to sell"
Only the SQ5 Plus (normal and SE) and 2.0 TDi (150 or 190) for S Line Plus (normal and SE) appear in the latest brochure ....................
Looks like Audi are consolidating their Q5 lineup to the most profitable models.
"Petrol was never popular or sold in numbers for the UK market.I don't see unregistered 20T cars up for grabs either. Loads of 190s, some SQ5 SE's and Pluses ready to go."
Where do you see this information? Is this available somewhere online? Thanks.
"Don't know about new, but as you probably know used cars from Audi dealers here >https://www.audi.co....tor-search.htmlI often find dealers will have cars which are not listed online."
"Have you tried the 'carwow' website - specify the new car make & model variant required and then sit back & wait for email offers to come from the dealers. It may be that a dealer is sitting with unsold stock which is no longer listed by Audi. A few friends have used the site to great effect, and achieved considersble savings (though not specifically for Audi vehicles - Land Rover and Nissan as I recall)."
"+1 I specced mine up on 'carwow, waited for the best offer then used it as a bargaining chip with the dealer of my choice, who actually beat it by 1%.An SQ5 plus SE is heavily loaded and can now be had for about £46K I believe."
Suspect you are still going to take a bath for over £1k per year even at that price in depreciation though.
Don't you mean month?

"Hi, Interested to know from owners who have moved from an SQ5 to a an SQ5+ and whether you really can tell the difference eg. extra power, handling etc... as every motoring report I read says that there is no difference at all just on paper!!"
Not sure as probably need to drive the + and make my own mind up but trying to save the time and effort!!!
"Put the diff to 'dynamic' and point it down a twisty road, I think you'll notice the difference."
"I have never driven a plus, but the sq5 handles very well and pulls like a train for a jeep type vehicle.If the sq5+ handles that bit better and is that bit faster it's all down to, have you got that bit more money.I know if I did I probably would as I would like to see a much more a good thing could be better.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Speed wise has anyone drag raced the two?Obviously on a private road????Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
I'm not able to tell the difference between the two either at the engine performance level or the handling.
What's HHA? And also did you get a good deal?
Hill Hold Assist..
"Hardly surprising, maybe it is a placebo effect?"
"...I guess so.Was 24 months into a 3 year PCP on the original SQ5, with car at 28k miles.Stealer offered the new SQ5+ on a new 3 year deal at exactly the same monthly contribution figure + new £5k cash deposit.*** packet maths suggested that since I'd put in a reasonable deposit originally, I was looking at £11.5k depreciation over 2 years which I thought was extremely reasonable.I get a new car, from the dealer's perspective they get a new vehicle sale...and of course a customer tied into another 3 year finance deal."
Improved rear suspension set up??
Does the sport diff make much difference? Thats the only change on the newer SQ's that interests me.
"Difficult for me to qualify - have been known to be a ""spirited"" driver at times (mostly in other more sporty vehicles on track) but I have neither the aptitude to apply full beans to the Plus nor enough on-road fast driving experience to tell if it improves things massively.Maybe someone else has a view?"
"I say 'Yes', massive difference but I seem in be in the minority of one on here!I actually do have quite a few qualifications to go with more years experience than I care to remember! Coincidentally I have been asked to help out on a short term contract delivering some very, very nice cars, starting tomorrow. I'll maybe post up a pic or 2."
"If its not too much bother can you deliver any Mercedes C63s AMG Estates to my home address I will send you a Private Message with my address when you are ready, LOL. Good luck."
Is it me or have prices on used SQ5's dropped through the floor?
"I was thinking the opposite - I decided I couldn't justify an SQ5 as a family wagon and went for the 2.0. Admittedly I haven't had it properly valued, but I reckon mine is now worth £23-25k, a good £7-9k less than an SQ5 the same age and mileage. That would have been the difference in the new price so the SQ has done much better on depreciation.The question I'm wondering is, are quality used car values going to find a floor (or even go up?) with the new £40k tax and the fact that new ones are going to go up sharply at some stage given GBP weakness."
"Having looked at the end of July I would say prices are down 10% on then with the cheapest SQ5 on the Audi Used cars site being a Sept 2013 car at £28K at Crewe with 62K miles.http://www.audi.co.uk/used-cars/used-car-locator/q5/3.0-bitdi-quattro/crewe/605919602-22273.aspx?srcmdc=se_na_re_Its got the essential extras in my opinion - Tech Pack, Remote Boot, Panoramic Sunroof and Heated Front Seats and looks in pretty good condition from the images"
Except 21's!!
"Extras dont add value (with the exception of Nav) to the resale. they may help it sell quicker or it may be more desirable for someone looking for those options directly.Resale, I'm thinking 10-15% and its only going to accelerate with the new car coming out."
"You are confusing two things.The trade value is not impacted by options, or colour - trade cars are about miles and condition with the exception of SatNav. In the private market if a buy wants those things he's likely to look for them.Playing two cars off against each other is a game of chicken with the dealer and the results may well have been the same"
"2 identical cars with different options fitted have 2 different values, regardless of whether that is dealer, private, buying, selling. It is a myth that options make zero difference."
Well you try and get that deal then... its a reality.. sold enough cars to have been butt loved over the years.Huge clue is the dealers dont even bother asking you the options fitted these days.
Don't forget if you try to sell back to an Audi dealer as soon as you give your reg number they will check out spec from their records this may blur the picture slightly.
"Totally, one way you can see it in action call up BMW (or whoever) and give them a spec of the car, for a trade in against something, then call back with a changed options list and see what the diff is on trade-in. maybe add or omit privacy glass, or folding dimmer mirrors..I don't wanna argue it out, people can check it out themselves and we can agree to either disagree or have had different experiences."
"Yep, have to agree,My experience was, only difference seemed if my trade-in had done more than 12k miles a year or not.I argued that if my sidesteps weren't going to account for anything, i'd remove them before trade-in, so they gave me another £500 off new model on that point, ( as I'd optioned sidesteps on new one too!) but I could have probably negotiated that anyway, got the distinct feeling they were just humouring me.I agree that options may make an easier/ quicker private sale, but as a trade-in, it's pretty much pre-set computerised quote."
"Dealers will not give you more for options, but will sure list all the options they didn't want to pay for to justify their asking price.Envoyé de mon E6653 en utilisant Tapatalk"
"If we're talking the diff between a car with privacy or without, clearly there is no change! Thats quite obvious. Howwever, the diff between a standard car with no or little extras, and one with roof, wheels, Bose, heated seats, towbar, mirrors etc is clear. I have no desire to argue the point, simply saying I have experience that it makes a difference."
the value of anything depends on the buyer (demand)The one thing I wanted on my Sq5 was the roof - I would only have bought a non-roof Sq5 if it had been significantly cheaper
"I think you also have to consider the age of the car being sold/traded in. A high spec, nearly new car seems to attract a higher price (buyers looking for ""new"" car at a larger discount and shorter lead time) rather than a much older car where the spec will make little or no difference other than to the speed of sale......................"
When ordering my sq5plus I was undecided about the B&O. I have 2 small kids so didn't think I needed it and when the kids are not with me I think I'll have it in sports so won't have music that loud. The salesman managed to give me the B&O free as it was in the dealerships best interest not for added future value but for resale purposes. Higher spec cars sell easier than lower spec.
"Just checked WBAC to check out their price on my Sept/2015 SQ5. They say £33,000 that's down £13,000 in 13 months so a £1,000 a month.............."
"That valuation looks good however....On a 2016 (1/3/2016) SQ plus with 4k miles I'm seeing £30800, but yet on our 2013 car with 30k on the clock WBAC is returning £29800Basically the newest cars are being really hammered, keep them for a min of 2 years; if you don't make sure you take lube when visiting your dealer for a trade-in."
Is it me or have prices on used SQ5's dropped through the floor?
"I'm toying with the idea of changing to a latest model Mercedes C63 AMG Estate (test driving one next week) have used some online sites to see what discounts are around and looks like around £7000 is possible on a new one. Really torn as I like the SQ5 but am tempted by that V8 Bi engine in the Merc. No doubt I will be completely smitten after the test drive... or maybe not as possibly may still prefer the SQ5!! Mercedes' own valuation site shows my car at £34,200 for showroom condition. Similar spec cars are on the Audi site at around £40,000!!"
"you mean Mercedes trade-in value for your car is £34.2k , and Audi are selling them at £40k ?If so, then Yes, sounds about right.If you meant Audi trade-in value is £40k (no way surely?) then stick with Audi"
"Trade in at Merc is £34,200 but of course show room cars at Audi are around £40,000. Any idea what Merc does with nearly new cars from other makers?"
"They are generally a group of many dealers - they will have an Audi dealership somewhere and flip it to them to sell, or just drop it at the auctions."
So if they have an Audi dealer who is willing to buy then perhaps possible for more than their £34.2 online valuation price? Travelled from London to Salisbury for my SQ5 as that was the best deal around but that was trading Q5 for SQ5 so different situation. If I go for the Merc will see what the deal is then send my spec to other Merc dealers within 100 mile radius and see what deals are out there..
"I've sold my SQ5 today to a dealer (May 2014, 19.5 k miles, 21's and Tech pack) I got £31.5k. I think I could have got more privately, but was happy with the deal.As for AMGs, I love my SL55 and never plan on selling it. I've never said that about any other car I've owned.Whatever you choose, they're good cars, not a bad problem to have!"
Was that a straight cash sale or P/X for another car?
"Cash sale. No part ex. I know he's after another, I can put you in touch with him if you'd like?"
OK wouldn't hurt to take his details can you PM hem to me? Tks
PM sent
Had a long conversation with Audi dealership today and interestingly they said that when the new Q5 arrives next year there will be a period of perhaps 6 months when prices of used SQ5's will firm up and -as was the case with the TT- could even rise for a while as there will be no discounts on the new model and no new SQ5 so to buyers the older shape/cars will look pretty attractive and demand will increase until new Q prices soften a bit and next gen SQ5 arrives probably not until 2019. So my master plan is to run my current car until late next summer and then change before the bubble bursts!!!!
"I'm just wondering how the changes to the road tax from April next year will affect residuals of the SQ5. Anyone buying a new one next year valued at over £40,000 will have to pay a extra £350 per year for 3 years and that's on top of the annual road fund fee! Sooo, me thinks used SQ5's will become an attractive proposition and help maintain values?"
"Yes for sure but its the interim period that you need to watch and also the VED tax hike will help a little more but if someone moves away from an SQ5 they are very likely to buy another car worth over £40,000 anyway. Incidentally does the new VED increase mean if you buy a new car and register it by April 1, 2017 you are not liable for the new tax or do they catch you anyway?"
"As long as you register before you get the existing tax levels.I dont believe the used SQ price will go anywhere but down - you never said, but I'm assuming the used prices haven't improved from the previous numbers.New model will be Audis excuse to over inflate the prices for BREXIT, but with OZ now looking to sue VW and the impeding 25k job loses it inevitable.On a plus note, now the existing Q5 is no more thats the last of the old Audi platforms gone so it should save them some money."
"I think the reality is that anyone with over £30,000 to spend on a performance car will give serious thought to buying an older SQ5 compared with the new Q5 which even in standard spec will probably be near or over £40,000. The old Q7 was in a similar position when the new one came along and for a while prices held and slightly increased as the new model is seriously expensive. As for the tax if I decide to exchange my car I will try to do it before April 1 next year."
"Hi,Does anyone have pdf version of q5-sq5.pdf brochure from September this year (2016)? I'm looking for the one before the SE editions.Audi seem to replace the pdf with SE editions and there is no way to access the old versionhttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/dam/audi/production/PDF/PriceAndSpecGuides/q5-sq5.pdfThanks"
Found it!Tried to upload it here but failed as the max file size allowed is 4.88MB and brochure is 6.82MBI'll try to put it somewhere on the web later today
"Hi All,I live in the central US and have been advised by Audi dealership (during the last scheduled service) to replace the brake pads and rotors (front) and pads (rear). The quoted me about $800 only for the front. One of my colleague who owns couple of BMWs (X5 and M3), told me to buy the parts online and he will replace them for free. I believe him to be good since he has done the same for his both BMWs and is an ex-Air Force engineer and owns a small plane as well (services himself).Now, my question is that which brand should I buy and from where? I heard Akebono makes good pads, what about rotors? how many sensors do I need to buy?I am also looking to buy new all-season tires and would like to know which one is the best? PepBoys has Hankook on promotion (buy 3 get 4th free), is that brand good?Thanks a lot...Kumar"
"I understand that, but I don't want to buy it from Audi dealership... is there a reliable website I can but the OEM parts from?Also, the winter is not that harsh here, so all season tires will be fine. Is Hankook a good brand? how about the road noise?Birendra"
Can't comment on the other sizes but the Sq5 plus on 21s is a very nice ride.
"yep. I have 20"" Audi wheels for my winter tyres and 21"" summers. It does make a positive difference to ride with the higher profile tyres, although the SQ5 is firmly sprung (but I like that) - and it has less suspension travel as it's lowered by 30mm - bumpy roads can still make the ride 'jiggly' though. Smooth roads are fine though. But remember it's not a limo, it's a sporty, fast or economical, familly load lugger."
I prefer the ride of the 20s over the 21s.
"Was a little worried that the 21"" on my SQ5 would give a firm ride but pleasantly surpised to find its actually nicer than the 20"" A4 Avant Black Edition it replaced which now feels extremely hard (it wasnt at the time).A little road noise on m/way, but nothing the sound system doesnt drone out."
"madeinstein said:CoolCurly: Interesting what you said about A4 Avant vs SQ5. I've got A3 S-Line with 225/40R18 and I find the ride quite a bit too firm especially in the city with all the bumps, potholes etc.. Would like to get a bit more comfort from Q5/SQ5 so 20'' might be the save option.This website has tyre height calculator, never realized that 40 on the tyre size is the ratiohttps://tiresize.com...ize-calculator/20'' SQ5 - 255/45R20 = 4.5inch height21'' SQ5 - 255/40R21 - 4.0inch height18'' A3 - 225/40R18 - 3.5inch heightClick to expand...Unless you prefer the look of the 20s I wouldn't be put off by the 21s. My A4 is an sline as well on 235/40 18s and like you I find it very firm, great on smooth roads but it can be quite harsh on poor surfaces. The SQ5 on 21s has a much better ride quality, not too firm but also compliant ( no bangs or crashes) and IMO is spot on.As you say a 40% aspect ratio on a 255 is actually not that low a side wall, nowhere near the rubber band look."
Zero. It's not worth that much.
"Fully agree, but will that stop them trying?Are they likely to keep selling cars cheaper here than at home, could lead to a reversal of the trend in the 90s when UK customers travelled to Europe to save a few quid."
"Won't happen,They wouldn't sell any,people will start looking at either end of the scale, at Porsche Macan's or Ford Kuga's, rather than having the mickey taken out of them."
And how many people in the UK make their living from working for VW either directly or indirectly. The Goverment sueing the brand and putting it in Jeapody of colapse wouldnt make great news when you have '000's of UK residents then out of work.And VW were the only ones to get caught - so far. Lets wait to see what and who is next. Thankfully no UK owned Manufacturers left to be investigated. They were too busy being on strike in the 70s.
"EPA have confirmed they have tested other manufactures and found nothing. Merc and BMW at least are in the clear.DE government wouldn't let VW go under and the potential break up of the brand would no doubt be in the interest of consumers given that means greater competition between the parts.I doubt very much any jobs would go in the UK, the breakup doesnt/wouldn't remove the need for those posts, all the UK jobs are in support/services. People are still going to need to service/repair cars. Hopefully the UK government are planning to doing something soon."
"No such thing as best settings, its all personal preference.Yes, had both and wouldn't pay for B&O again, or at least not the one supplied in the Q5."
"You need to tweak it, the bose in my cabby is by far and away the best in car audio I have ever heard so that made the BnO a 'must have' for the SQ.Unfortunately first impressions of the BnO were disappointing but after bit of experimenting it sounds almost as good as the bose, absolutely worth the extra £500 and even better if you're getting it for nothing."
"Hi All just wondered what fuel figures everyone are getting for a sq5plus ,just got back from a 1000 round trip to Scotland and back and the figure was 39.1 mpg average.Drove up giving it as much as I dare (without getting my photo took !) and it averaged 36.9mpg and today drove back in eco mode with adaptive cruise on set to 75 mph and it finished on 39.1 mpg is this what everyone else is getting ?"

"High 30's is my usual figure but thats according to the on board computer which are always optimistic,still miles better than my previous 2.2 4 cyl diesel range rover evoque that was sold on 49+ mpg promises from dealers."
Dashboard numbers are garbage - but that said it does seem that the Q5s get more economical as you increase the engine size rather than less - I average 30 in my 2.0
"See my Fuelly number in my signature for average fuel economy since Day-1 (combined city/highway), 35,000 km total. Mind you, I hypermile a lot of the time.(BTW, I agree withpurephase's ""...Dashboard numbers are garbage..."". Mine are always very optimistic.)"
I would say I average 24-26mpg.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

"Great find on the video, definitely Mexico........and that's a long way away. Order to delivery might take some time?"
Maybe they will have to build a wall to stop the Americans grabbing them all!These videos followed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ1OFkUXWd8
Certainly an improvement on the existing model..
"There seems to be different expectations of where these cars will be built.One version is that America bound cars will be built in Mexico, and European bound will be still built in Germany.I hope that's the case, but any info I can find on the net just states that the new Q5 will be built in Mexico and arrive in Europe in 2017.Anyone have a link to show they will be continuing to build in Germany aswell ??"
Audi have now confirmed Mexico (San Jose Chiapa) will build the Q5 from late sept this year.Ingolstadt will instead focus on other models. It doesn't make clear what that means...The millionth car rolled off the production line on 4th Aug (2016).
"Hi,The new Q5 does look good, not the leap I would have expected looking at other new introductions from VAG, The Q5 just looks safe, taking design cues from the Tiguan and the Q7.We'll have to wait and see if Audi can add any character for the SQ5.After 2 SQ's I'm trying an F Pace. Not sure about the Macan, more money for less.Cheers"
"I quite like it, and I think the interior is a massive step up (if you specify virtual cockpit) - I don't really mind the raised screen and most rivals have it anyway now. What I come unstuck on is the price - I reckon must figure that with everyone buying on PCP these days that they will hide the higher sticker price by having dealers fiddle with the contract/mileage/balloon payments etc to make a monthly sum that works. Issue is that I would be a cash buyer, and so it's going to be a massive jump up to an equivalent of my S-Tronic 2.0 S-Line+."
"I've always had the feeling that this would be the case,as the only sources I've ever heard about the Mexico for Americas/ Germany for Europe theory was from this forum, never heard it anywhere else.Shame, it puts me off the new Q5 just that bit more."
New reviews are here and a longer video on the production...Good step up on the current model for sure.2017 Audi Q5 Review2017 Audi Q5 Cabin2017 Production Facility
"https://www.youtube...new Q5 14 min clipVery nice, it's by far the best looking of the new Q cars, SQ5 will no doubt be a belter.Unless they are ridiculously expensive I'll probably get one in a few years time, more than happy to run about in the 'old' plus until then though.Good to see they've fitted sensible door mirrors but don't like the screen, looks like an after thought."
Could be wrong but I think the 3.0tdi is permanent.

It looks non retractable too, just like my wife's new 2016 A4 Avant. I hate it, it is the worst piece of design I have seen for a long time and whenever I get in the car I want to rip it out. My mate has just got a new Q7 which has a retractable screen, which is really nice option. The fixed screen is terrible piece of design - apparently Audi conducted a survey to find out if retractable screens were necessary. Who on earth would say no?!"
As well as looking like an iPad on a Poundland mount it won't make cleaning the inside of the windscreen any easier either. Like the rest of it though.
"I also hang onto my cars for a long time. Last one was 18 years (although I had others in my garage at the same time). I imagine owning a decade-old GPS when I think of a factory NAV system. That's why I go a for a replaceable state-of-the-art Garmin unit, and I replace it when it gets long in the tooth. Can't do that with the stuck-on-iPad NAV."
"Agreed! I won't buy a car with one of those sticking up, looks ruddy horrible."

Must admit apart from the cheap looking VW front outer grill and that ridiculous ipad super glued to the dash i really like it.Would have liked them to keep with the daytime led shape going right around the light . Every car has angular ones etc these days but the q5 looked so distinctive however the new ones dont exactly look bad ...sort of a q shapeThere just not as individual. Same goes for the rear for me.Im not a fan of the wheel arch trims either if im honest although they look better than the q3s for some reason.
"""Audi's Q5 latest quattro 'Ultra' four-wheel drive system, which stops drive going to the rear wheels if you're just cruising along, in a bid to save fuel."" ""There's unlikely to be a two-wheel-drive Q5, incidentally; Audi UK makes a point of fitting its quattro systems to all of its SUVs north of the Q3, and that's almost certain to continue here, even though some countries sell a 148bhp diesel version with front-wheel drive."""
quattro is not a match for snow tyres and doesn't help you stop when needed.

As long as manufacturing/assembly quality remains constant its a smart business move I guess. Don't forget corporate tax incentives they may have in Mexico.Wont be long until its a fully robotic assembly line though anyway.
"I'm sure though, that Audi will have to guarantee so many jobs for so many years for Mexicans, to get whatever deal they have.Seems a hell of a big workforce though, 4,200 ??Think I'll have to watch the vid again to make sure I heard that correctly."
They'll all be bringing their factories here and offshoring to the UK as the £ goes lower as we start to brexit(unless someone figures a way to not leave EU after all - and I'm sure that there will be a lot of people behind the scenes right now trying to work how to do that)
"Not at all, UK will become non tax free trade zone for rest of UE, so there will be no benefits to move production there. There are already several car manufacturer that started to be interested in moving out of UK."

Back to the 2017 Audi Q5
"If you look at the German Audi website then they have the configurator up for the new Q5, but only for the 2 differently powered 2-litre diesels and the 2 litre petrol, you're not able to build a 3 litre diesel yet, and of course the SQ5 has not even been announced yet.My German's not good enough to understand it all, but can guess most thingshttps://www.audi.de/de/brand/de/neuwagen/q5/q5.html#page=/de/brand/de/neuwagen/q5/q5/linien-pakete.html"
You are assuming with the massive cuts Audi are making it WILL still make an appearance..
"And they're talking about an RSQ5, 450bhpCould this be an either/or situation, regarding whether they bother with the SQ5 and just go to the max with the RS ?Could make sense, normal 3.0l V6 with the only jump for serious petrol heads being to the RS."
http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/audi-forced-dramatically-cut-costs-after-dieselgate
"It is reasonable to assume that Audi will challenge new projects that bring risk, as any company worth its salt should. The huge success of the Q5, and the SQ5 is likely to mean continued investment in these cash cow models. The SQ5 was originally anticipated to be quite niche, but has turned into a mega successful off-shoot of the Q5 model. Simple business principles. Keep doing what works well to generate base cash flow."
"My understanding is that Audi is Volkswagen Audi Group's (VAG) cash cow. When you put the cow on a strict diet, it'll deliver less milk. It then looks appealing to shoot the cow and have steak for a short time. It might be time to rethink that strategy."
"SQ has only been selling ok in the UK, don't confuse the 2 things..UK market is not where Audi are looking anymore. Just as a data point Q3 sells 30% more cars by volume than the Q5 in the EUMakes 0 sense to have two engines for the same car, i can't see the TDI surviving the big axe.S models for the new Audis have all happened at launch or very sortly after launch of the new models. TT, A4/5Not even a hint for the Q5"
"So having done some cursory browsing online I can see that buying the more expensive (likely genuine) lead from Ross-Tech and son on, over the cheaper ones available from Amazon etc., only really means that you are unable to update the software beyond what seems to be around version 12...I'm only looking to buy one to toy around with some of the simple coding (needle sweeps, door light activation, emergency break rear light flashes etc), not to use it for other models or any serious maintenance.What are people's opinions on this? Is it worth spending £270 on something I'm unlikely to use outside of my 2010 Q5?"
"for the simple stuff, buy Carista.I have one and you can do needle sweep etc simply"
"Thanks Jonnyspin. I had heard of Carista and see that once you get the app and hardware, you've probably only spent around £40 however there are 'in-app' purchases which puts me off a little.Worth noting though, especially for the smaller changes."
You might want to search for someone local with VAGCOM to do the changes for you?
"Depends what you want to change. nothing much of interest/value can be done on the Q5, so are those little changes worth something to you?"
"Regarding the'in-app' purchases with Carista if you just do the full un-lock you wills never pay again. The other cheaper 'in-app' purchases are timed so you can spend a set amount of time making your changes (a week?). Dont see the point in doing that tbh, in case a service update wipes them. Although my last service left everything intact (and there was an update to the air-con system).Still far cheaper then Ross-Tech VCDS will ever be. But as SnowMan said, it depends what you want to do.Have a look at this thread:http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/23850-carista/page__st__20"
"I bought the genuince HEX-CAN USB cable in 2008, for £250, and sold it a few months ago on an Audi car forum for £220. I used it literally hundreds of times on my a few VAG cars I've owned (Golf MK5, Audi RS4 and my Q5)"
"Ive just bought one off a well known auction site for £50 and its fine, fully unlocked software and no limits to what can be done, ive also got Carista paid version and thats great for doing the general coding changes that most people want.Im not generally a software abuser but the RossTech cable and software is just a touch pricey for me.21"
"Ducknpineapple said:Ha ha! Yeah I ended up going down the £50 route in the end and switched off the auto update.In the end it did cater for most of the changes I wanted which included needle sweep, tone on alarm when locking, extension of the radio player time (after ignition is off), increased the MMI decibel level, switching on the puddle/warning light option, switched off the 'Start/Stop' function, turned on the rear 'indicator emergency stop strobe' and changed the lock settings so that one press of the key fob would open all doors (inc. boot) rather than just the drivers.I couldn't switch the dial/gauge lights to be on as you start the car instead of just when the main beams are on... I see that Carista does that.

Yeah I ended up going down the £50 route in the end and switched off the auto update.In the end it did cater for most of the changes I wanted which included needle sweep, tone on alarm when locking, extension of the radio player time (after ignition is off), increased the MMI decibel level, switching on the puddle/warning light option, switched off the 'Start/Stop' function, turned on the rear 'indicator emergency stop strobe' and changed the lock settings so that one press of the key fob would open all doors (inc. boot) rather than just the drivers.I couldn't switch the dial/gauge lights to be on as you start the car instead of just when the main beams are on... I see that Carista does that.

"Yes, but my point is that Audi are changing the definition of Quattro that has been their ""usp"" since the first Audi QuattroSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Yep, understood and fully agree, although some may argue that Haldex is not 100% permanent 4x4 either but that's been described as quattro for a while?I'm a fan of the old fashioned Torsen diff and hope they keep it on the 3.0."
"I think you're maybe over reaching...The new car does have the real/full quattro system, not the Mickey Mouse Haldex thing - the difference is they have opted to enable it to be able to run 2wd for fuel and efficiency reasons no doubt. Personal I'm cool with it and makes kinda sense - my only question is who controls it and how?I'd rather have the permanent system however and i think as above it will be only offered for the lower models in the range.."
"It does make sense for efficiency and, in the summer months particularly, will probably hardly ever activate. I think the car controls it, in milliseconds, but I'd still prefer to decide myself and would run permanent at all times given the choice. Like permanently switching off stop/start probably won't be a manufacturer's option though because it would screw up their emissions.I wouldn't be surprised if the independent techies are already working on an aftermarket plug in controller, 60/40 rear biased split would be good."
Audi have gone stupid with the pricing lately... its just crazy over the top money.I guess they are looking for new owners to pay down the US fine.
"One of theBIGreasons I bought my 2015 Q5 3.0 TDI ""Prgressiv"" (mid trim level) was because I looked thoroughly at BMW's, Mercedes', Porsche's and even Lexus's offerings, and found I got a lot more car for my dollar in a Q5 (and gorgeous looks, which Lex does not offer) as compared to the competition. I'm pretty sure I'm not unique in that respect, as the Q5 is not only Audi's best-selling model, but also the world's best selling SUV in its class (mid-size luxury).Jack up the price sufficiently and the Q5 becomes a lot less ""value for the dollar,"" and a lot less appealing. We'll see if the new Q5 continues to be a class-leading act, or just another expensive, mid-size SUV."
"German has become so boring in virtually every way. Lazy design, boring drivability (feedback) and lack of all round creativity."
"I challenge anyone who has actually driven the R8 to slag it off - the old or new model. Plenty of people who have never driven it like to criticize it, but every one of the NA engines in that range has been phenomenal - and the current V10+ will probably be the last proper NA sports car ever made by a reasonably mainstream company."
I recently spoke to my audi dealer and he said the new SQ5 will cost a lot more when it comes out.
"If so, expect big discounts after 12 months imhoSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"Well i have one of those V10+ things (and i had an MK1 too) and its by far be best looking car in the range.But yes, the design is lazy, or maybe safe is a more accurate description.Audi has gone down hill fast in terms of design, the Q cars you can excuse - they are just boxes on wheels and theres not a lot you can do with them.. i cant work out if its a 911 evo approach to things or marketing simply have too much say and safe is the new language."
"Getting back to the original post.Will there be any noticeable difference ?Apparently AWD senses which wheels require most input, so if it was on motorway it would probably be driving like a 2WD anyway wouldn't it, with majority of input going to the front wheels?And if the new version switches 'effortlessly' between the 2, isn't that just doing what AWD basically does, just kicking in 4WD when necessary?"
"I'd wait and see, it's just unknown at this stage so is pure speculation.Audi maybe lazy, they may have forgotten how to design good looking cars and move automotive design on, but they are not totally silly, they wont walk away from quattro."
"My point was that, according to the existing Q5 section of the Audi website, the definition of Quattro is PERMANENT awd. So part time awd, by definition, is not Quattro. I'm not saying it's good or bad - I don't know because I clearly haven't driven it yet. Although my Crv had that sort of system and it was poor in the snow (with its standard M&S tyres)Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
"I suggest to you and other readers that the Audi website was notdefiningQuattro, or presenting a definition of Quattro for all time, but merelydescribingwhat Quattro was at the time of the writing."
"It quattro, not Quatto and it doesnt have to be pemanent.""Audi quattro is our renowned all-wheel drive technology. Developed through Audi motorsport engineering, quattro is a cornerstone of our philosophy. Today it brings safety, sportiness and performance to everyday driving."""
In my experience Haldex worked very well in both the A3 and TTs which I have owned. No doubt the latest incarnation of quattro will be even better.
Sounds like the under-steer can be just as scary with a Haldex as the Honda system. From Missile's experience the settings in terms of how and when the system kicks in the rear drive may be different on performance orientated vehicles( TT & A3) compared to soft roaders (Yeti/Tiguan/Q3). I have never tried a Haldex equipped vehicle on snow but recall a 3.2 V6 A3q I had as a service courtesy car a few years ago being pretty secure in the wet.
"Apparently it depends on driving mode. Normal modes will be front biassed, but dynamic and off-road modes will be rear-biased, so means whatever they put between front and rear axes can be somehow 'locked' for driving in more demanding conditions:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRRTqD7YvQI."
I watched a good video on YouTube about how the Tiguan 4motion works which also uses haldex couplings. Basically it senses what wheel has the most traction and puts the power there so when cornering it will put power to the two side wheels on opposite side to direction your turning! from owning that car for last 3 years I never had a problem with how it worked you heard it clicking on and off every now and again but never really had it anywhere where I needed 4wheel drive.
New Q5 wont be the cheap 4motion solution - the engine mounts the wrong way..
My A4 was the same transverse mounted but only FWD should have kept that rather than get the Tiguan but not worried now as soon the Tiguan will be gone once I get the SQ5
I was unaware that Audi ever made a transverse engine A4. Every B range model from the original 80 (B1) through to the current A4 (B9) that I have owned or seen has had a longitudinal engine.
Oops that's what I meant longitudinal not transverse the Tiguan is transverse my bad
I had the B8 A4 on a 08 plate
Just watched the carbuyer video on YouTube of the new A4 allroad and it says it comes with Audi Quattro plus. 2wd until needed.
It's ok it's ok watch this and breathe a sigh of relief.
Hi are there any tyre gurus around?I have just treaded my A5 Black Edition for a Q5 Sline plus.I have a nearly new set of tyres on Audi rims. Size 245/40/18. These fitted the A5.I'm wondering if these wheels will fit on the Q5. current tyre size 255/45/20.Any one have th edefinitive yes or no?Thanks
"https://www.1010tires.com/Tools/Wheel-Offset-CalculatorWheels may fit, stud pattern is the same but you'd need to check the width and offset to be certain, they'll be stamped on the inside of the wheel.Tyres will be no good unfortunately, they'll look like rubber bands and will throw your speedo etc way off, you'd need 60 aspect tyres on the 18"" rim."
"Yes I think you're right.The smaller dia overall will give about a 11% speedo difference, indicating 67mph at 60 mph actual.So decision is made. Ill sell the wheels/tyres as a job lot. and get a new set on bigger rims.Thanks"
If the wheels fit you could save yourself a fair bit of cash by buying a set of 235/60 R 18 winter tyres and mounting them on your current rims.
"I currently have 235/60/R18 Bridgestone tyres. I use these because although I use the motorways often, I regularly go off-piste and holiday around the UK's more agricultural areas.Anyway last year Michelin released the 'Cross Climate' range. The website suggests they're good for the wet UK weather and are also classified for winter use.They reckon it's better than 'All season' tyres which tend just to be dumbed down winter tyres.Anyone had experience of these new Michelin 'Cross Climate' ones?"
"Yeah I considered the latitudes at one stage but as you say, the common conception is that they tend to fail somewhat spectacularly in the snowy scenarios. Pretty pointless 'all weather' title really.Ordered the 'cross climates' now. I'm going on the premise that they're not officially classed as 'all weather', but really summer tyres pimped up to suit winter conditions as oppose to what most 'all weather' tyres do, and simplify winter ones.Proof is in the pudding of course..."
It's only too true Steve. There are so many variables in the real world that affect each driver it's impossible to get a perfect tyre. Everybody's got such specific requirements.I would like to get an opportunity to test out the 'winter' benefits since they market the tyre in that way... Road trip to Norway or the Alps would be excellent... But more likely Scotland. I understand there are some unbelievable roads up there!
"Ordered SQ5 plus special edition today, first new car ever for me so a bit scarey!Ordered in Sepang blue with black wheels.Special edition has a good spec so only extras ordered areRed calipersCarbon atlas inlayHigh beam assistTow barJust got to have one so hope I've done the right thing."
"Sounds just like me a year ago, no SE then unfortunately, looks a very good buy, you'll love it."
"Congratulations! I don't think you can go wrong with a Q5. It's audi's best seller, and the best-selling SUV in its class. The details of your specific configuration are just a matter ofyourpreferences.For my two cents' worth, the current generation Q5 is one of the most beautiful cars on the road!"
"I'm wondering what peoples views are on whether it is it ever OK to try and contact the previous owner of a vehicle?I have a couple of questions that I would like to ask them. Nothing bad, just for information.If course if anyone on here previously owned a SQ5 estoril blue, 63 plate and comes from the Suffolk area please get in touch."
I'd consider contacting a previous owner akin to contacting your kidney donor.avoid.
"Oh am surprised you think it's a bad thing to do.I wouldn't mind if someone contacted me about my previous car, could share information etc.Anyone else have a view?"
"I was thinking of emailing or calling, wouldn't ever turn up at someone's door though that's a bit stalker!"
Just been online to check my SQ5 plus order (still in transit) but noticed that instead of saying SQ5 Plus it said SQ5 Special Edition. This made me curious so had a look on the configurator and you can no longer order a regular SQ5 the only option is SQ5Plus then under engine option you get plus or special edition. Pano roof comes standard on SE along with B&O drive select and advanced key. Couldn't find the option for memory seats or piano black inlays only carbon atlas of brushed alluminum! Can only think it's because of new Q7 sorry mean Q5 launch! Lol
I would go back to dealership to find out exactly what is coming and decide in advance whether you agree with the order or not.
Up until yesterday it said plus just when I looked today it said special edition. I took a screen shot and have emailed the salesman so I'll await a reply. It still says the correct spec I ordered just this special edition wording at the topIs there an easy way in here to put the screen shot on here?
"Well if there is some mistake, it sounds like it may be in your favour, but you still want to know what it is exactly.If you haven't already, download the latest 'The Audi Q5 & SQ5 Pricing & Specification guide 2016' and see if it explains it in there."
Spoke with salesman via iMessage and he says it's the same as I ordered they have just changed the name. Not getting pano roof but didn't want it when I ordered still getting black inlays and memory seats so happy now. It is a good saving though if anyone was to order now
"Audi are just clearing the decks of options that don't sell well, this is normal this close to the end.Free is always great."
At the dealership this morning I was shown the latest online newsletter from Audi UK. The order book for SQ5s is now closed. No more new orders can be taken from today onwards.
Its been taken off the website too.SQ5 is dead.
I think at this rate mine will be last off the production line...
Interesting.... hopefully they've managed supply properly on the run up to the new model.
Wonder if the special editions will hold their value any better?
"I just connected my new iphone to the MMI, and there appear to be functions that I wasn't aware of...It might have been that my old phone wasn't up to the job??But, just in case it helps anyone......if you connect your phone to the car's wifi, you can stream music or internet radio (via your phone's 3g). But, perhaps more useful, you can automatically get the phone to 'remember' where you park the car!Is this all a recent app upgrade? or had I just not realised this before?"
iOS 10 has been updated for parked location:http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/10/01/maps-app-remember-where-you-parked-your-car/
"It's been part of the app for a while, as was streaming.Nothing to do with iOS, which has recently added (copied - just for a change) similar functionality."
"I've always been sent little message from my Audi Android MMI App telling me where my Q5 is parked and for how long.this used to happen on my old MY14 Q5 also, but it' a good reminder jonnyspin to those who aren't yet aware of it."
Unless you ride in someone elses car...

"Shopping for a good car cover for my 2016 Q5. I like what I have read on the Sealskin brand car covers. The Q will be garaged, but I want something with good layers for scratch protection. Anyone have any experience with Sealskin covers?I'm happy with the Max Tech 3-layer cover I have for my Corvette, however they don't offer a thick cover for the Q.This is where you add your 2-cents and write about what you purchased.Thanks."
Did some serious research over the weekend and pulled the trigger on a 5 layer cover for the Q5. It should arrive this week. -I'll post a review with a few images.
"Yep, I'd be looking around for other quotes at those prices.You need a well established local garage that specialises in VW/Audi, take your car in and explain what faults Audi found, and ask for a quote.( I wouldn't show them the prices Audi are asking at this point)With a 7 yr old car, well out of warranty, you don't need to use Genuine Audi parts for everything, so long as local garage is guaranteeing suitability of parts they do use."
Personally I think that out of warranty there's no reason to go to a main dealer for servicing if you plan to keep the car for any length of time. Just find a decent independent - they will do a better job than the dealer in my experience for far less money than you will lose on resale without main-dealer stamps.
"As above find an Audi Independent, and don't pay those prices."
"Independent should save you a fortune, or if you're handy with a few basic tools and have the time and inclination, you could save a fortune and do most of those jobs yourself."
Job looks easy enough...
"I managed to get down to about £315, and someone else on the forum got £250http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/31049-2nd-service-cost-38k-miles/"
"From what I see there is some regional variation in prices on servicing and I expect to pay more being inside the M25 so I'm happy at £360.MrH, if that is for a 1st oil/filter change and inspection they will match it for around £360 as I was getting quoted around £450-£480 to begin with, Bexley Audi gave me the best price without asking."
i was told by Wimbledon Audi where I bought my Q5 that Ad-Blu was free and always would be - and if ever i needed a top-up just drop into their service bay and get some - free.as I don't live near Wimbledon - I've never actually put that to the test.
.... AdBlue smells like the kids peed in the pool
Yeah it's true I just piss in the tank once a year thought the funnel was for this. Saves a fortune.
"Just an update, car was serviced a couple of weeks back and no problems to report.An air con software update was performed but no effect or comments on my VCDS mods so I guess they were not noticed.Total cost was £338inc."
Got same air con update as well.
The air con update wiped out some of my VCDS settings.
Out of interest what did you lose?
"Just had my first service by Watford audi£275.00 oil and filter, pollen filter and as blue top up well as other usual servicing checks and updates"

New Q5 launch confirmed for 29th SeptemberJust found this short video teaser showing trackpad and compatibility with Apple and Android deviceshttps://www.youtube....eature=youtu.be
That was just a pure tease - 19 seconds!
"Satin black looks interesting, that's the only official shot as far as I can tell?Blue rendering looks quite good, the red one - not a fan. Just hoping they don't take too many styling cues from the other new Q cars."
"Can't make my mind up, I'm just glad I have a 5 month old 'last model' , so no rush to buy the new.I'm sure it will grow on me gradually, especially if the interior is right."
"Looks a bit too ""Evoqued"" for me ..."
"Hmm interesting, I must admit it looks great, only taken Audi 6 years to finally fit LED's to the Q5! And, then go and use a key from a TT! Seriously, I would expect attention to detail and maybe have a unique key for the Q5 like the Q7 has.Dealer is being very hush hush but expects showroom car in April which seems a bit late to be honest."
"From what I've seen so far, I like the current Q5 a lot more. I'll wait until the car goes public before I pass judgement, though. I'm not fond of the new Q7's looks, inside or out, and I believe the new Q5 is going in the same direction.In my anything but humble opinion, the current Q5 is amongst the most beautiful vehicles on the road. The exterior styling isperfect, in my view. The new Q7's tail lights and the new Q5's sneak peak tail lights looks VW inspired. The new Q7's headlights are typically Audi ""hit-and-miss overstyling"". Just not my cup of tea :-("
I got a text from my local (Slough) Audit dealer saying they had great deals on current Q5s right now... reckon it's a great time to pick up a bargain if you prefer the old shape.

"So i've heard the current Q5 standard specification is going to be increased to include panoramic roof to entice customers to purchase the old model over the new one due to long expected build dates, then waiting for shipment from Mexico."
of what year?
"UK/Europe Q5's will still be built in Germany, the Mexico built units are for the North/South American market."
2016
If the UK Q5's are coming from Mexico I'll probably jump ship and order a Macan
"wow, the Concept Q5 or the actual new model?sorry if i am asking obvious questions but my Internet is very controlled here and i can hardly see anything on the links posted."
"The model launch is 29th September 2016 on line and will then be at the Paris Motor Show (opens 1st October)My dealer is on a training and driving event in December in Germany and suggests I will be able to order a car in December but my Sales guy has nothing confirmed other than he knows he's going to Germany in December to see, drive and feel the car."

Read my post above yours. They aren't coming from Mexico.
Glad I've ordered current sq5
"Barbyboy said:Have driven the new Q7 - IMO, more angular than outgoing model, interior is very classy, dash and button layouts excellent, although trackpad a good idea but very difficult - would work well in a lhd vehicle (if you're right-handed) but in a rhd vehicle where you have to use your left hand fingers to ""draw"" letters and numbers, it's very fiddly (unless you're left-handed of course). Ride is very comfortable throughout a large cabin with decent performance in standard 3.0 guise. Presume that the SQ7 must be a bit of a monster...Negatives - wheel arch infills are just horrible - look very aftermarket. A pillars obstruct some viewing and overall size of it makes parking / finding a big enough parking space a challenge.On balance, still prefer the Q5.Click to expand...Thanks BarbyBoyWas at dealers at weekend and they had a nice ex demo Q7 S-Line with most of the toys I'd want and a good (21% saving) however the interior of new A4 seemed more substantial and of a higher quality than the Q7, adding in the fact that we don't really need anything Q7 sized, I will wait to see what Thursday brings with the new Q5 - I am also quite tempted with the new S4 Avant especially if the SQ5 isn't going to be launched in this first batch"
"The SQ5 will be launched in first batch,It's the new RS Q5 (450bhp) which will come later.As mentioned on another post, I wonder why the new Q5 will only lose around 100kg, when the Q7 lost 325kg, seems a bit un- proportional ?"
"Well the Q5 is smaller then the Q7, so there are less parts to chop off, or substitute for a lighter material."
"Well, yes, I understand the Q5 is smaller, but it's not only a third of the weight of a Q7, so I'm wondering why it's only losing a third of the weight the Q7 is losing?.As I mentioned, it doesn't seem to add up 'proportionally'For e.g.If the old Q5 weighs (rough guess) say about 80% of the old Q7, why isn't it losing around 80% of the Q7's 325kg weight loss, or well over 200kg?"
"Your reasoning is based on the (possibly incorrect) assumption that the current Q5 and previous generation Q7 were both constructed identically, that being that the Q7 is just a slightly enlarged Q5. That might not be the case. The current Q5 might be considerably more ""efficient"" in its design/build as compared to the previous gen. Q7, therefore, there are fewer opportunities for weight reduction. I'm just playing Devil's Advocate, without knowing how the two compared as baselines."
Sadly no SQ5 launched this afternoon - 282BHP 3.0L Diesel is the most potent
"Looks pretty good IMO, the RS will be a real tempter no doubt, maybe I should start saving!"
Press release link for the new Q5 is herehttps://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/even-sportier-and-more-multifaceted-the-second-generation-of-the-audi-q5-arrives-6819
"so ""evolution, not revolution""... only interested if the sq5 is available before march, and the price hike isn't too ridiculous"
"One of the motoring mags estimate starting price of £39K so I'm guessing SQ5 will probably start in low to mid 50s. Once all the toys are added (looks like there will be quite a few to choose from) it could get pretty pricey, particularly if there are no discounts?"
hmmm Macan money! that's not going to work

"Just configured a current SQ5 Plus to the same spec as ours and it is just under £56K, as you say by the time you've added air suspension, head up and virtual cockpit I think a new SQ5 will be close to £60K or slightly moreThis is right into Macan pricing - however the Diesel S diesel runs the old 3L and when I was lent a car for a week I felt that the engine was the weak link compared to our SQ5 with the 8 speed gearbox"
"problem is that it's Macan GTS money - and that is some car... Ok, petrol fuel consumption might be an issue.... but better residuals would ballance that."
"I doubt this new Q5 will have current Q5 owners rushing to dealers to ""upgrade""......this owner certainly won't be. IMO, The new grille looks as awkward as the one on the Q3 when it was introduced. Hopefully there'll be a black pack option to maybe tone it down a bit. My jury is out until I see it in the flesh!"

"I like it more than I expected to. Not a fan of the front grille though as others have mentioned. I'll reserve judgement until I see what they do with the SQ when it comes out. The RS would be very tempting, but will costly to run in comparison to the current SQ."
"I first saw the official ""Real McCoy"" here:http://www.autospies.com/news/PARIS-MOTOR-SHOW-Audi-s-New-Q5-Cements-Itself-As-An-Icon-Of-The-Segment-89802/I must say that I'm extremely happy that I bought a2015Q5! The new styling leaves me cold."
"Not impressed with it. It's just a large q3 or small q7 not much design difference to either of them! The rear lights look the same as new Tiguan, the side doors and windows look out of proportion. Not a fan of oops we forgot the radio/info screen let's just stick an iPad on the dash look the same as Mercedes and I think BMW. So happy I've bought current model rather than this generic Audi SUV. The steering wheel is also ugly IMO unlike the current one. The only thing I like is the virtual cockpit although having said that I really like the 6oclock needles that the virtual cockpit does not have unless you can change in settings"
"My Dealer sent me some of the press release images together with a note saying that ordering would open in late October when prices and specifications would be confirmed, however the market introduction isn't till April 2017 - not sure what market introduction meansI haven't spoken to my SE but if I wouldn't get a car till April after the VED rates change I will look elsewhere this time round"

"the new Q5 is very Q7.i think Audi missed an opportunity here to take it a step further in styling and have played it safe.i guess if it's not broken don't fix it, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't look to improve.there now seems to be so much tech on offer that i might stick with the 2L TDi and load it up with tech instead of a 3L engine, because the cars will look exactly the same now since the tell-tale exhausts are a thing of the past on the new Q5."
"Personally saw the release pictures, watched numerous videos and i'm sadly very disappointed. I had high expectations from speaking to my DP who said he had seen the car before release and it looked a lot better. Sadly, I disagree it looks too much like a Q7 with a wide body and a very box looking shape. On the other hand interior looks great but when has the interior in an Audi ever been bad. Well not by BMW standards anyway."
"Whilst all the teaser pictures depicted a pretty ugly bus, the finished article is actually surprisingly elegant, it doesn't have the awkward proportions of the latest Q7. Audi could sell them by the bucket-load, I fear though after the exceedingly ambitious pricing of the Q2 launch the new Q5 will go the same way. Audi need to be careful as the competition is getting better."
"I've read all I can about the new Q5 on 'tinternet', and it all says it's being built in ""a brand new plant in Mexico"". Despite some on here saying that's only for the Americas/Pacific market and not Europe, I can't find anything to support that. Probably unfounded, but it does make me ask questions about potential build quality issues and long delivery times. If it turns out the Mexico thing is legit, I suppose it's a case of 'watch this space'!"
"I personally think that it's the best, more proportional looking out of the Q3, Q5 & Q7, although of course they're all in the same vein.Like a few posters have said, I'm glad I bought a 2016 Q5, giving myself a lot of breathing space, to see these new models out on the road, and read the test reviews.If reviews for ride quality, performance, etc, etc are positive, and I agree after a test-drive, I'm pretty sure I'll end up with one of these in a year or two."
"Before the new model was announced I had done an extensive review of other cars on the market that meet my ""practicality"" criteria and had whittled it down to two contenders. However both of those then failed the ""do the numbers work"" test in terms of depreciation so I will be knocking on my local dealers door as soon as the order book opens and we shall see what happens."
"I love my current 2015 Q5. Stunningly gorgeous, right up there with the Porsche Macan and Cayenne. This new Q5 design fits into the ""Audi Sea of Sameness,"" not too far from what we see from Volkswagen.If I was forced to replace my 2015 Q5 3.0 TDI, I'd be looking at the 2017 Mercedes GLC diesel. It still has the noteworthy looks that Audi has lost with the new Q5."
With my sq5 plus now in transit from Germany just wondering how the 40gb hdd and 20gb jukebox works. I.e. How to copy music to it? Delete / replace music. Also maybe a stupid question but what's the difference between the 2 apart from size? Also what size sd card can you put into the two card readers?On the same topic of this do you get the mmi cables with car either USB or lightening? I have in my VW and was planning on keeping the cables?
"20GB is the useable size for the jukebox. The rest of the drive is not available to use.You can coy off from and SD card MP3 files via the menu,Basically it's pointless, just put in a SDcard or USB drive and save effort/time.You can of course just use your phone over BT"
Thanks Snow Man ah the way i read it it had 40 gb and 20gb but now it takes sense that you have 20gb space to use. any ideas about the MMI cables?
"You should get both an apple lightning lead and a USB lead with your new car. If they are not given to you at handover, ask for them as they are included in the car's specifications."
"Hi everyone.I'm on the verge of buying a new Audi Q5 S-Line Plus in Sepang blue with the Extended Black Styling pack. It looks absolutely stunning and I'm extremely tempted but I have a few concerns.Firstly, I've only been able to test an S-Line plus with 20"" wheels and the ride felt fine (though it was on a decent quality road for about 15 minutes). I wonder putting 21s on will make the ride unbearable?The other concern I have is will having 21s on it make it unusable in the snow/rain and ice? I live in Scotland and although we don't get THAT much snow/ice you have to set yourselves up for some pretty crappy weather for a good 4 months of the year. I appreciate these tyres won't be ideal but will they make the 4WD pretty much useless?Any advice would be appreciated!Cheers."
"Welcome AIB82, firstly great choice of car and colour! You will not be disappointed with the 21"" alloys. I have them and love the look they give, seeing a Q5 without them makes me really happy I made the decision to get the larger wheels. I did attended Goodwood FOS this year and it was very muddy to say the least, with being parked on a hill and offroad mode selected I didn't have any problems at all.The only downside I find is unless the tyre pressures are set right the car does feel very 'skitty' on the road."
"ride will suffer on bigger wheels - but I have them and they work for me.in winter, a few of us have a set of winter wheels and tyres (18-20"" or so). Mine are 20s - and they do the trick for cold roads and snow/ice - anything below 7C, and especially the annual ski trip"
"Ive got the 21"" on my SQ5 and the ride of the car is actually better than the previous A4 Avant on 19 5 spoke Black Editions alloys. Not at the pleasure of snow (down south, always sunny) but as Ive had a Range Rover Sport before Im never expecting anything to match that!You'll not notice the dif between 20"" and 21"" apart from looking better.Nice colour choice - real men have Sepang.....heehee"
You can always just remove the wheels and get smaller ones if that's the only worry. They are plug and play..Personally i didn't like the ride on 21s and i run super cars so I'm used to a hard ride. I also think the rubber band look is not good for a 4x4.
Thanks for the replies and the advice about tyre pressure. So the good news is the dealer has managed to source a demonstrator car with 21s so I've arranged an extended test drive next week. I have put a deposit down subject to me liking the drive so one step closer.Also managed to squeeze another £500 out of him - beginning to think there is more discount there to be had though - they are dropping their prices too easily. What's the most anyone has got off a car? It's a stock car but aside from the Bang and Olufsen speakers is the exact spec I was after.
"Have a look at the ride height, the Q5 on 21s doesn't have the lowered suspension of the SQ5Some people like the bambi on stilts look, so it might not be an issue for you, but it put me right off the combinationA member on here did manage to get Audi to lower it to SQ5 height though"
The wheel size doesn't make any difference to ride height does it?larger circumference wheel = less rubber ( lower profile tyres) cancels out the difference.I think having either 20's or 21's is a totally overrated issue that only the owner would even notice.
No diff to ride height. The Circumference of the wheel remains the same.
"The ride height doesnt change, but the standard Q5 is higher than the SQ5So 21s show too much gap on the Q5 and make it look like its on stiltsNo one said anything about the wheel circumference changing lolIt's noticeable enough that some members nearly rejected the car, but like I said, some people don't care about things like that, so it might not be an issue to you"
"I'm not getting something,If the overall diameter of wheel+tyre remains unchanged, regardless of 19's, 20's, 21's, whatever, where does the increased 'gap' come from ?"
"Just go and take a look at one, or search here for the members that got extended black pack and complained about it"
"The perceived gap has nothing to do with wheel / tyre size. 21"" wheels look nice and appear to fill the arches better but this is an illusion.On standard suspension the Q5 sits 50mm higher than the SQ5. Previously one could specify Q5 S Line with sports suspension, but it seems this option is no longer available on Audi configurator."
"It's still there, but it never lowered the ride height. (on the configurator its under assistance systems)S line Sports suspension (Not lowered) - The sports suspension gives drivers a dynamic driving experience and presents the vehicle in an even more sporty light.Providing firmly tuned springs and dampers for more direct contact with the road"
"I think missile has cleared it up for me, thanks.There is no larger 'gap' but some may see an optical illusion, and perceive there is."
"Hi everyone.I'm on the verge of buying a new Audi Q5 S-Line Plus in Sepang blue with the Extended Black Styling pack.

"So I managed to get a good hour long test drive in one of the managers cars, a Q5 S-Line plus in Sepang blue with the black exterior pack. Pretty much the exact spec I'd ordered. I found myself looking for problems with the drive but in all honestly it drove brilliantly. Smooth as you like - no issues with the 21s at all. I got back to the showroom already to sign up then I saw it...the same car but in Daytona Grey. Stunning. My current Audi is Daytona so I'd been shying away from it for a change but it's 100% the nicest colour. Order changed and should collect in the next week or so!"
Order changed and collected in a week.Wow fastest car ever produced as Audi lock the spec 2 weeks before production.
Rather than trying to be smart by reading earlier posts you'd have realised it was a stock order. Both blue and grey were due in the dealer the end of the month.
"It's far from clear you had a ""choice of cars"", you said ""changed the order"".Stock means many things inc open, no customer allocated cars.Hope it goes well......"
"We just bought a 2017 Q5 S-line Competition in daytona grey, and we've been getting tons of compliments regarding the all dark theme of the vehicle. Not sure where you are from, but up here in Canada, the ""competition"" sub-model means black pack with 20inch anthracite wheels. With daytona grey, this means monochrome and looks awesome. Really stands out, as almost all Q5s around here are black or white with chrome. And I hate being like everybody else.Envoyé de mon E6653 en utilisant Tapatalk"
Can't see how that's possible within a week or so ?
Dealers can order stock cars. Cars that people have ordered and cancelled (or Audi have placed orders for to give them stock to sell at shorter notice). Dealerships can check stock cars and buy them for their branch to sell to customers. He had them both coming in at the end of the month. Hence why I could swap one for the other. That explain everything OK?
"Ok, great news, the only ones in my dealership are 2nd hand or demonstrator models, hence the confusion.I imagine the next time I see a new Q5 in there will be when the new model is released.I find the S-lins plus a perfect ride, but that's on 20"", never tried 21""s"
Would have been my colour choice as well but unfortunately in the UK daytona is about 2K extra on an SQ5+ and 21s are the only wheel option.
"Hello!I am thinking of buying audi q5. Because of finances I am considering 150 hp model. I am hesitating between 2017 ultra fwd model and quattro. Because there is only 150 hp, which one will perform better? For me is important also more gentle ride and not so much noise. And how will perform on motorway with two kids going to holliday? The other option I am also considering is Volvo xc 60 (150 hp, fwd, automatic). If you have any experiences with 150 hp models would be of great help in deciding.Thanks in advance,Gregor"
"I would say 150 bhp is not enough, would be underpowered.I would go for the 190 bhp if I were you."
"The 177 TDI was just not enough for sure, you really need to be north of 200bhp IMO"
The engine simply struggles to drag along the body.
Cannot comment on the Q5 engine(s) you are considering but I can say that (for me) the XC60 seemed overpriced and underpowered (and so very thirsty) compared to the SQ5 .........
"Agree entirely with this Snowman but as Missile says it depends what you you regard as acceptable performance.More intrigued by the 2wd option, I assume thatgregor42bis not a UK member as I did not think that Audi UK imported the 2wd Q5 derivative."
"...if 177 is fine for the 4wd, then 150bhp may be enough once the 4wd weight is taken out...although, I have to say that I struggle with the concept of buying a 2wd suv - but then I drive to my annual ski trip"
"""Sure if money is not a consideration the 3.0 or even the SQ5 are more fun in a straight line, but no Q5 handles well through the corners (you could argue the fast ones less so) and so I get my sporty driving kicks in a car more dedicated to that purpose.""Agree that a Q5 is not exactly a chuckable vehicle, primarily due to its' high centre of gravity, but I would say it is much better in fast sweepers than lobbing it at a tight turn that would not phase a lower c of g vehicle like an A3 or Scirocco. The firmer damping and improved body control provided by the sports suspension, if you opt for this, improves things quite a bit on the twisty bits."
I would have thought the SQ5 would be the best in the corners due to being lowered sports suspension. It's the lowest Q5 model.
180kg heavier? just the engine? I'm not sure I believe that. That's more than two big blokes.
"Dunno - probably there's some extra engineering elsewhere as well - but quoted kerb weight for 2.0 is 1820kg, for SQ5 is 2000kg (3.0 is 1980kg).You can definitely feel it when you drive them back-to-back!"
"just checked in my brochures and the unladen wieght is indeed +180kg......but some of that must be in things like bigger wheels, perhaps bigger brakes, extra standard equipment etc...."
Thanks all for your responses! Based on this discussion I have decided for 2.0 TDI 190hp (automatic). I have found used one (registered in 2015) with 40000 km. 40 000 is probably still OK for used car? It has been serviced regulary and has extended 2+2 warranty.
"40,000 km is quite high for a 1-1.5 year old car, but I suspect the only way to get to that number is to hammer it on the motorway at lowish revs which will do the engine no harm. A lot of people say they're not run in until they've done 100,000 km.You'll certainly get a good discount on the vehicle vs. a typical mileage example."
"Hi allWhen I picked up my Q5 last month, the sales guy mentioned the ""add blue"" situation. Does anybody have any guidance as to how often this would be required. I have to say he was pretty serious about the whole thing ""when the add blue reminder comes on, go straight to a dealer to get some added"".Thoughts?"
"You will get several reminders via the DIS; the first should occur at 1500 miles to go so no need to rush straight to the dealers.Real world mileages achieved before top up vary wildly (there are a few threads on here); figures of between 3,000 and 15,000 miles have been reported ...................."
"I have a 3.0 L V6 TDI. I've driven over 33,000 km (19,800 miles) and I've never seen an AdBlue light. The dealer does all my servicing and adds the AdBlue. It has obviously lasted long enough to go between major services without incident."
"my AdBlue warning just came on on my MY16 (EU6) 2.0L TDi at 6,500 miles.On my MY14 (EU5) 2.0L TDi it came on at 20,000 miles."
All depends on how full the Adblue tank was when you first bought the car. mine has done 15000miles no sign. although when I ordered my q5 I was adamant with the salesman to ensure that the Adblue tank was full to thebrim.nmym8 has a tiguan brand new factory order his Adblue sign come on at 3000 miles. the servicing depth at vw told him that they only put in 5 litres which is 1/4 tank.
"My (possibly incorrect) understanding is that Audi ships their diesel vehicles with ""enough"" Adblue to get them to their first scheduled service. They are not shipped with a full Adblue tank. However, depending on driving conditions, Adblue consumptioncouldincrease resulting in a shortage before service and Adblue fill."
Depends on the size of the AdBlue tank on a particular model (as well as everything else already mentioned) ...................
here you go. already discussed and as I stated before. Adblue tank is never 100% full to the brim.http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/28290-adblue-mileage-before-top-up/page__pid__333234#entry333234
As I topped mine right off a couple of weeks ago I'll be able to tell my real world consumption in about 9 months or so ..........................
HiJust about to order SQ5 plus but really can't decide on colour. I normally drive Mercedes and currently have a white coupe. Have had black before so I know the pros and cons of each colour. My big issues are the looks. With the black pack on the black car looks a bit lost but on the white stands out. This is a really hard decision as I have only just decided to get the car as 24 hours ago I was getting the Mercedes GLE. Thanks for your help
"Love my Sepang, but white looks good too..."
Thanks guys..spanner in the works the monsoon grey looks pretty good
Ibis white was a no cost option so its a no brainer.Hides scratches and chips plus easier matched if the worst happens.Looks better and you can spend the money saved on something nice like reverse camera or the like.
"Glacier White, brings out the best of the Q5"
"re: Red (volcano), I would not have chosen this naturally, but it was the colour of my 5 month old car when I went to look at it, and in the flesh it was stunning, particularly with red calipers, so I'm a changed manI dislike white as i hides the shape of a car, I had two metallic black cars (still have one) and they are a pita to keep clean, so would not go there again......so, were I to buy a new one, I'd be vey tempted by the £1000 option to take any colour in the Audi range to be distinctive - perhaps that purply-blue? or yellow!, or that baby blue, or...."
I'd go with white for the Q5.
Suzuka! Looks like white but so much better.
"I have to agree. Had the ""black"" package so no chrome and I think it looks really good."
I had considered volcano red and sepang blue but when talking to the wife she liked the grey or silver both very nice but decided on monsoon grey can't wait to pick it up in 4 weeks!

"Any tips guys on this, it seems very hit and miss on weather it lets you change it, mine currently keeps saying FAILED to set new photo ????"
Probably because your image is too large. Mine is 200x180 pixels. If you want square try 200x200 or 180x180. Either way there will be a maximum.
Regularly drive to France and wondered if there's any decent blind spot mirrors around as the French are pretty good at creeping up and overtaking before you can say Bonjour!! The Summit BST150P looks decent?
Just be more observant?
Observation is all very well but accidents can still happen when driving on the wrong side of the road!!

"The Q5's have wing mirrors like elephant ears,If you can't manage with them i'd stick to Skegness or somewhere local"
"i got Tech Pack Advanced with Side Assist on my latest Q5 - works brilliantly.i probably take it a little too much for granted but it lights up and warns me of approaching vehicles (from both sides) at a decent distance, and likewise it tells me it's ok to change lane when normally i would have thought otherwise but it seems to be a good addition and i would want it again on my next Q5.i don't think you can retro fit it, but it would help you out alot GRANDDUC."
"Lol, agree, they are way too big, great for looking back but cause large blind spots at roundabouts etc, the only thing I genuinely dislike about the car.Funnily enough though I don't seem to have to worry about being overtaken, could explain the 25mpg I suppose."
"I would order the lhd mirror glass as it has a blind spot area on the glass, that's what I intend to do.I have also wired my reverse camera so it can stay switched on when driving, amazing what you can see on the camera before the mirrors pick it out."
Which particular LHD mirror are you looking at as there's lots out there?
This possible via VCDS/Vagcom or is this a physical hardware change?
"Whilst my car was in for service recently I popped into the parts department, I asked if they could order a LHD mirror glass with the blind spot section, answer was yes but we dont need a LHD version as there is a mirror glass option for the passenger door with the blind spot section built in.I ordered it and it came three days later, £52.00 all in with VAT, Fitted in minutes and works really well.Please let me know if any of you want the part number and I will dig the box out"
"That would be helpful, thanks. Did you fit it yourself?"
How can I do this? I would like to change the system setting so there is no max speed setting that disables it. Anyone know how set this in software rather then doing a hardwired mod?
"Looking to buy a used (2014-22015) Q5. Have a question about the Panoramic Sunroof. I know it has only the perforated cloth cover, where I've driven a Ford Explorer that had a sliding solid cover. I'm thinking the solid cover would do a better job at blocking out the sun & keeping the interior cooler, particularly if I end up with a black interior.Is the glass tinted to help with this? Has anyone found it necessary to do / add aftermarket tint?Thank you,Blair(future Q5 owner)"
"Yes, it has a slight tint."
The perforated material is a sun blind. This and the tint are perfectly adequate in my experience.
Certainly works fine for me
Yes indeed.
OK for me.
Works well for me on my current SQ5 and previous Q5 ????????
"Glass has a decent tint, I've not shut the blind since I bought it and no overheating issues - the weather has been crxp mind you."
"Never shut the blind even on the brightest of days,makes the interior feel really small and dark,cant understand people who dont spec it,was first on my options list closely followed by many more ticks of the option boxes!"
"I wouldn't even consider a car without a panoramic sunroof now. Air conditioning/climate control is NOT the same as a sunroof. I like the open roof and fresh air blowing through the car - like a giant convertible.Never used the blind, ever. Tint on the glass is more than sufficient."
"I like the sunblind, I feel that the car can get a bit hot if the sunroof is closed and the sunblind open. Mrs however always insists on sunblind open regardless without fail.I definitely prefer the black/dark headliner, its more sporty and looks better with black leather seats etc. Having had light colour in the past on different car, I didn't like it as it just doesn't feel as pleasant a space to be in (could just be me), it marks and can get dirty easily to."
When I was specing the car my wife talked me into it because I was not a fan before. Now I wouldn't buy I car without it.
can't see why you would ever want a dark roof - but when it is closed it's pretty dark.
"By roof, do you mean headliner or lack of sunroof or maybe the blind closed?"
"I have the pano roof with a black headliner. It makes the cabin beautifully light. I do have young children however and when they are sleeping in the car during a hot day I sometimes need to half close the roof blind, I also have the side window blinds (because nothing ruins the look of your Q5 more than a stuck on window blind from Boots!) which makes it nice and shady in the back."
Me too got black headlining in current car and looks much better than lightNot got pano roof on current car and didn't go for it on SQ5. Dealer talked me out of it saying hot in summer colder in winter plus the noise when raining. With 2 small kids it seemed best not to get it
We specified it on our SQ5 but the Mrs doesn't open the blind let alone the glass and after the first year or so we suffered with dreadful rattles only sorted with a complete replacement at 37 months (under warranty) so not sure if I'd pay again.

"I gave up driving the car unless the roof was tilted or open to be honest, Mrs didn't seem to be bothered - I kept complaining and then the supplying dealer when we had it serviced in May this year said - oh you have a problem with your sunroof lets see what we can doCar was booked in for 5 days which turned into 8 days - they lent me an A1 which sat at the airport and when I picked it up it was rattle free"

If I ordered a new Q5 now I'd be looking at 3 months build time. How long until the new Q5 is available to order?"
"The new model would be the problem for me, spy shots are out so the car is close, Orders normally come pretty quick after that.""A guess"", and it is a guess.... Feb unveiling, July buy."
"If that's July order, October delivery then I would be happy to order an old model now. What I don't want to do is order one now and find out the new model is available to order before the end of this year."
Look for 12-14% discount on Q5s right now. Just use the brokers as a guide.
"As I've just been through all this, hopefully this will help:I spent 6 months reviewing hundreds of online reviews between the Porsche Macan, Q5, Merc and X3/5. Most reviewers said the Macan was the best (just), but the Q5 was mostly second and sometimes first. The Evoque never got into the top 5 of reviewers' choice. I got 12% discount and they paid £2500 towards the deposit (as long as I bought via Audi PCP). I've now had my Q5 S Line Plus 3.0 TDI for 5 weeks, and it's actually *better* than I thought.Audi Q5 3.0 TDI S Line Plus, Mythos Black. July 2016 Registration"
"Go on the 'babyrr' forum and read various threads about build quality, reliability, fuel consumption, dealers..........Best thing I ever did was to cancel an Evoque order a couple of years back! And they're as common as muck, they're everywhere!! A fine example of form over function."
"Yep, at this late stage in the game especially !"
I think I am right in saying the pan roof in RR doesn't open just a big window one more point for the Q5.
"Hear, Hear!"
"On the cabin, if you take a look at the new A5 that will show you what you will get in the new Q5."
My mothering law has one and the fuel economy is bad. Also just the other day the lower front valance fell off.
"Another no no for the Evoque, the beauty is skin deep and it lacks the kind of engineering integrity that we take for granted with Audi. I had one and LR bought it back after 9 months, it spent 12 consecutive weeks in the dealer, simply dreadful.	The Evoque is actually similar in size to the Q3 (though the boot size in a Q3 is larger), more modern technology than the Q5, i.e. LED headlights (awesome)."
I always wanted a Range Rover then I saw the evoque which again initially I wanted but after it's been out for a while I am glad I didn't. I'm not a fan of the new Audi interiors with pop up screens in my opinion it looks like an after thought the same as bmw. Mercedes have just stuck a screen on the front of the dash and again in my opinion looks terrible. I had looked at the new Tiguan (which is nice but it's not what I really wanted) to replace my current one but ordering the SQ5 was the only way for me!
"My wife is after a new car - and it seems to have come down to a Q5 (3.0 S line plus) or an Evoque (portfolio) both with black pack, panoramic roof, leather memory seats etc.I expect a bit of bias.

"Side note, I had the Tiguan in the US a few weeks ago. I have never returned a hire car before - this was a first.It's the worst car I've ever driven, and i have some dogs in my time (thanks Hertz). Shocking car, i hated it with a passion and lasted 3 days before it was dropped off."
That's interesting - assuming it's the new shape Tig that doesn't bode well for the new Q5 which will be on the same platform.
you can't open the Pano roof on an Evoque.for that reason alone i eliminated it from my short list.i love my Pano roof and have it open about 10 months of the year on a regular basis.
"Hang on, What??You can't open the pano roof on an Evoque??Surely not, that can't be right is it ????it's fixed glass that doesn't open?? who would want it?"
You can't open the roof on the CRV - didn't like the car anyway.
When I looked at the Macan you could option either a fixed glass roof or an opening one.
"re CRV - That drove me nuts when I had one. What's the point of a sun roof if you cannot open it to get the open air experience. So, same as above, that was the LR off my list straight away."
"Its not the same platform as the Q5.The tigthing uses PQ35 and is front wheel based, where as Q5 is MLB and MLB2 for the new one."
"and, I believe, the Macan runs the current Q5 platform. So the revised Q5 will be on a newer (better?) platform. That will be interesting."
"Well, you learn something new everyday, as they sayI've never considered speccing a pano roof, so hence never looked into the details,But I'm gobsmacked that manufacturers make 'a sun roof' that doesn't open.I get that the interior will be a lot brighter, but would also assume that just abouteveryonewould want the facility to wind it back, Incredible, but obviously they sell."
I think the Macan is already on the new platform (which may explain why it's so good). That said I was wrong about the Tiguan!
"This one I'm not sure of... the Macan is based on a very heavily modified version of the existing Q5 i ""believe"" the next Q5 will be based on the A4 platform.""As mentioned above, the new Q5 will sit on the same mechanical platform as the latest Audi A4 (a larger version of which also forms the basis for the Audi Q7). That's likely to mean the new Q5 will be up to 100kg lighter than the current model, thanks to extensive use of lightweight materials."""
"A little reading makes me think you are correct - again doesn't sound like a good thing as the current A4/A5 range is getting panned for handling and feel. I was hoping it might bring the new look A4 interior, same great engines, Macan like handling and Q5 styling which would be a massive win for me. I'll reserve judgement though until I drive it!"
"Evoque pano roof is essential especially if you had the coupe like me,the rear side windows must of only been about 12 inches high and the rear window was like a letterbox,i specced pano roof and light headliner/pillars to make it as bright as possible.just as well the roof didnt open it would of rattled and squeeked even more than it did!"
"Sounds like the CRV has changed, I bought one of the first ones in '97 and it had a large glass sunroof, electrically operated, which opened fully but bizarrely was over the rear seat passengers. No wind deflector either so could not drive above 30mph with it open because of buffeting.Good build quality in terms of panel fit and rattle free but very plastic trim. Under-bonnet layout impeccably tidy and the black crackle finish cam cover, a la Ferrari, a delight to look at. Not the kind of engine you normally get in a truck/SUV/4x4."
I think you'll find the mark 2 Q5 available sooner than July next yearI believe the car should be launched next month and available early 2017

"I don't believe the SQ5 will be available Q1 2017 but I expect the 2.0TDI and 3.0TDI will be, however Audi launched both the A5 and S5 coupe together this week so I may be proved wrongI wonder what % of Q5's are SQ5 as that will surely dictate how quickly the mk2 SQ5 is availableI'm working to replace our SQ5 before the Car Tax changes in April 2017 so am running out of time to place an order and take delivery of some of the competition if that's what we decide to go for"
Also looking at the same thing...
"My wife is after a new car - and it seems to have come down to a Q5 (3.0 S line plus) or an Evoque (portfolio) both with black pack, panoramic roof, leather memory seats etc.I expect a bit of bias. What are the benefits to either and what would you order after having had your Q5 for a while (or possibly having had both)?Supplementary question - I believe a new Q5 isn't that far away. If I ordered a new Q5 now I'd be looking at 3 months build time. How long until the new Q5 is available to order?"
Hi Snowmanfrom memory we picked up our SQ5's at similar times back in 2013 as some of the first owners?
"Yeah, one of the first ones... i dont normally keep cars more than 2 years either.From memory it landed end of June but we waited until sept."
"Hi allI picked up my new Q5 S-line plus last week, and just wanted some advice on the various drive modes. So far I've worked out that ""efficient"" mode is probably best for mpg, and ""dymanic"" mode is probably least fuel efficient, but what are the other modes for?Cheers"
Efficiency mode is pipe and slippers mode
"As a tip, give this a try.Go to 'Individual' modeSet Engine on 'Comfort' and steering on 'Dynamic'Works for me anyway, rarely change out of that setting."
"Perfect thanks mate, will give that a try"
"""best"", no such thing only personal preference.."
Efficiency mode is horrific - my wife managed to set it by accident once and it took me 20 miles to work out what the hell had happened to the performance!To be honest I think there's too much faffing with these modes - I just have it in comfort - it's an SUV not a Caterham.
"Some bozo veered onto my side of the road and his mirror whacked mine. How much for a new one? 300-400-500-600-800-1000? No sir, that'll be £1045 plus 3 hours labour (another £350) at your cherished Audi stealer.My insurers (Admiral .... who have been excellent during the whole claim process btw) direct me to a local bodyshop and some young East European mechanic fits the mirror in 40 minutes. I doubt he's even seen an SQ5 mirror before so how come Audi whack you for 3 hours?"
"I bought just the lens from local auto parts shop. £38. I managed to clip the housing back into shape after whacking it.Doubt it was Audi original, but identical, including the heater element connector"
"I've replaced one before, it's not that hard. If you've not done it before maybe 90mins?you need the fasteners as they are fragile.Other option is just have them body colour.. I'm looking to change hers to body colour."
"I assume they are quoting you for an electric folding one with auto-dipping glass at that price. Have a friend with a Q7 who was ""hit"" by a passing van and Audi quoted a similar figure. He managed to stick the housing bits all back together although all the electric controls did not work properly afterwards. Dipping glass alone was about £200 if I remember."
I have some specially mixed aluminum paint and top-coat for sale that I didn't need after all :~)
"Yep, the glass itself was apparently £248 and the mirror is auto-folding, auto-dimming, heated with side-assist in the housing."

One question perhaps someone could answer; initially when I changed the drive mode to 'dynamic' the gas pedal would move up a little bit (i.e. closer toward my foot) but now it is no longer doing that. Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, does anyone know if there is some setting maybe was changed and perhaps I can change it back in the MMI?thanks in advance for any helpNick"
I have never noticed any difference.
"Hi allI'm aware that your driving style will largely dictate the answer here, but on average, what MPG are you getting out of your cars. I've just done my 1st re-fuel and it looks like I'm getting about 40mpg (around 685 miles per tank) before Iost my nerve and topped up.Is that about right?"
"Yeah the driver information systems (dashboard fuel economy readouts) are notoriously inaccurate.Fuelly.comlets you enter read odometer readings and real fuel consumption to calculate real fuel economy.FWIW, you'll get variances with respect to how full a specific pump will fill your tank. The shorter distance you travel since your last refill, the more that variance affects you fuel economy reading."
"Just noticed your fulley says 36.9, which is similar to mine as mentioned above.I believe the 3.0l and SQ5's may well get better mpg than the 2.0l models, if driven 'normally', because of power/ weight ratio.For Stubok22 with his 2.0l version, I think mid-thities at best, unless on regular long runs of 50-100 mile +"
"Last one 36.6mpg over 15k miles, this one 36.7mpg over 10k miles.I consider myself a pretty gentle driver but the consumption is hammered on the 4.5 mile commute."
"I must be doing something wrong, very wrong! I am on an average of 36.9 MPG in my 2.0l with 4057 miles. I do majority motorway at 75-78 (legal of course) and a bit of town driving. I can't get anymore than 480 miles out of a tank which to fill is about £68 from entering reserve."
"If you're interested in maximizing fuel economy, joinFuelly.com(free), where you will find lots of tips on how to conserve fuel (Community -> MPG Tips). Each tip has a percentage value to tell you the percentage of members who found it useful. I found I get significant better fuel economy at 50 mph (80 kph) cruise than at 60 or 75 mph. Anything involving acceleration -- city driving, stop 'n go traffic, hilly terrain -- has a considerably detrimental impact as well."
Drop it to 70mph and you will certainly notice a difference. If I am not in a hurry and enjoying the ambience of the Q5 cabin I sometimes cruise at 65mph and can see low to mid 50's on the DIS.
"Well there's nothing wrong with 36.9 mpg, thats about all you will get in reality,but I'm not sure about your sums if you're having to refuel every 480 miles your mpg wouldn't even be that high.You've probably still got loads in reserve though, e.g. if your car takes 60 litres to fill, you've still got 15litres ( over 3 gallon) still in the tank."
"FWIW:My DIS (Driver Information System, or dashboard readout) has reported 4.2 L/100km = 56 US MPG = 67.2 UK MPG) over a distance of over 500 miles. It's fiction. Use real fuel-up and odometer numbers for real MPG numbers..The shorter the driving distance, the less legitimate the fuel economy readout, as it'll be influenced to a much greater degree by short-term anomalies (e.g., driving downhill for a distance), as well as variances in fuel tank filling."

Ha Ha Ha and gulp.See my fuelly.
"I have never been convinced, based on many years experience, that 5mph makes much of a difference in terms of mpg achieved. The ambience of the cabin is equally enjoyable, perhaps even more so given its refinement, at much higher speeds.Life can be dull driving @ 65 all day long in lane 1 despite the fuel saving."
"Interesting discussion coming out of this thread. Especially, a SQ5 doing 650+ miles on a tank! I'm one to poodle around in my Q5 however no matter how much I usher it I still struggle to get mid 40's. I don't ever let the car run into reserve so as others have pointed out there is still a considerable amount left, but the DIS says otherwise. I get a warning at 80 miles to empty."
"So much for the trusty DIS system. To be honest, I just brim to brim so don't pay too much attention until I see others getting 650+ miles and question, where I'm going wrong. Ha!"
"Hi allI'm aware that your driving style will largely dictate the answer here, but on average, what MPG are you getting out of your cars. I've just done my 1st re-fuel and it looks like I'm getting about 40mpg (around 685 miles per tank) before Iost my nerve and topped up.Is that about right?"
I brim to brim as well. 650+ miles is actual not DIS. Yesterday's fill up was 688 miles since the last. Ha!
Maximum I've driven is 818 miles during a highway-only 50 MPH road trip.
That's pretty good (actually amazing)! What do you get on a regular basis (as opposed to continental mammoth journeys)?
"In the summer, I get between 650 to 700 miles on a tank. Canadian winters are worse. For example, my last mixed city/highway tank was 700 miles, 6.34 L/100 km = 37.1 US MPG = 44.56 UK MPG. I'm constantly ""playing the game"" to get the best fuel economy, trying to break previous records."

"I've carefully logged by fuel economy since day 1. I've keep good notes about road trips. I've done the Ontario to Florida run (1850 km = ~1150 miles) several times. First time was at posted speed limits, which were up to 75 mph. Second time was limited to 60 MPH. Third time was limited to 50 MPH. On my vehicle, each speed reduction made a significant difference in fuel economy! 50 MPH is the sweet spot!"
I've never gotten more than 38mpg. My average is around 34-35mpg.
Absolutely Missile!Need one say any more?
"This seems very accurate to my exeriences, best ever was 39 mpg on a non -stop run up to Scotland, never cracked the 40 barrier in 2.5 years.Other, normal commuting times, mid 30's.That's the 2.0l Q5 folks, driven normally."
"Just filled up today cramming as much in as possible, DIS shows a range of 490 miles. I will never achieve this."
It certainly seems like you are on a mission. No offence intended.
"SteveMak said:I believe that trying to use an Audi Q5 to save money would be a questionable move.

"Nope. At 50 MPH, it's running in top gear (8th) at 1,200 RPM, and getting very respectable efficiency. It'll kick down a gear when climbing a steep hill, though. If called upon, it can briskly accelerate just by giving it more throttle. The 3.0 diesel has monstrous torque, even at low RPM. It's one beautiful engine!"
Totally agree .................
"Don't get it? 3.0ltr/ SQ5's 50 mph, getting as much fuel from a tank as possible, nope just don't get it. Still each to there own."
"That is mighty impressive.I'm not 100% convinced that lower speeds always lead to better economy. A couple of years back I drove my 3.0tdi cabby up to Aviemore sticking more or less to the speed limit, average was about 33 or 34 mpg. I drove it 130 miles back down the A9, just before the cameras came online and was home in under 2 hours, average 46mpg, the best it has ever achieved.Outward leg was a hillier route and both figures were according to the DIS but I was pleasantly surprised at the return mpg."
"Yeah, I was quite surprised. Back in Feb I did a similar run with 8000 on the clock and got 26mpg; last week was with 16000 on the clock - perhaps we are starting to get run in?"
It has been a few years since one could average that kind of speed down the A9 without fear of prosecution given the diligence of the Highland & Tayside traffic cars over the last 20+ years. I well remember the high profile prosecutions of a 911 driver and 2 sport hatch drivers racing around 1990 after which unmarked cars patrolled the Highland section daily.I agree that some of the best mpg figures I have achieved over the years have been on fast unhindered runs where the posted spped limit may have been breached.

December would be good as current drive goes in December and I feel a new year snow trip
12 weeks is my guess.
"I have had confirmation via My Audi that i have an estimated construction date of 14/11, how long after this date do you think it takes to land into my eager hands."
My car went into quality control about a week or so before they were due to start building it and arrived at the dealers about 2 weeks after the original build date so you might get it towards the end of November.
"Hope so as the thought of the arrival of the beast makes driving my current Merc awful, finding lots of faults."

"Lots of BMWs are built in the US too (all the X models).It's more than just transport costs (ship space is cheap)Just like the apple, people are buying ""designed in"" rather than ""assembled in"". A screwdriver is the same no mater where its used IMO.The manufacture of goods will be linked to trade/commerce deals etc - real shame the UK doesn't do this, but maybe that will be coming back post BREXIT.For completeness Q5s are also made in India and China for those local markets."
I wonder how much does a Q5 actually costs Audi to manufacture?
Just read a number of past threads about which tyre to choose and it seems that previously 21'' tyres were not available from all the main manufactures. Wondered if that has changed and if so what do forum members recommend? I am currently on P-Z's which came with the car and have covered around 11000 miles but they seem in good shape but haven't checked how many mm's are left.

Ok i spoke to my local audi dealer this morning. Theyhave agreed to carry out a multipoint check for £200 +vat which is basically what they carry out for the sales department on used cars bought to sell as Audi approved which sounds pretty good and this should flag any issues prior to the warranty expiring. Also they are going to carry out an mot for half price £25 which will include £750 contribution should a mechanical item fail in the first year.
"So after comparing cover between audi dealer extended warranty and warranty direct, I chose warranty direct as it was Â£100 cheaper, covers wear and tear parts and parts being damaged from a breakdown or , I also negotiated a discount of 10%to forum users as there's so many of us , the warranty was Â£570 for 1 year full cover , and you won't need to pay any Â£ out yourself 1st as they work directly with audi , and it covers diagnostics í ¼í¸²Tel 0800 731 7001Option 4Extension 2881Reference 1347767Simon woods"
"What suits me will not suit others. It is a very personal choice. That beauty of using ADS is one can tailor the settings to your own preference which may change day by day.Having said that ADS is a bit of a novelty and after playing with it for a few weeks, I set up my individual preferences and never touch it now.I use S mode, when I feel the need for speed."
"""I set up my individual preferences and never touch it now""What do you have yours set to?"
"I leave my Audi Drive Select in ""Comfort"" mode to eek out the best fuel economy. Mine has no ""Individual"" mode because I didn't get the Nav system.I wish I could get firmer steering while in Comfort mode, but that's not possible on my setup."
"What works or me, on Individual.Steering in dynamic modeEngine in comfort mode"
yep tyre centre will sort that
I'm probably being thick here but to me the diagrams above suggest major repairs are allowed in the sidewall? Based on comments received in the past at tyre repair places I thought no repairs were allowed in the sidewalls??
"Yeah I think that is generally the case that tyre centres will not do repairs on the sidewall. I don't know why the KwikFit diagram shows sidewalls as a major repair area, as its normally a new tyre in that case."
"I had almost the exact same repair done earlier this week except my nail was even closer to the side wall!Mine was about half way between your nail and the last bit of tread.The guy said it was 50/50 and may work it may not so I said give it a try before I get a new tyre.4 days on and the job is good, they did not plug it though they did the repair properly with a patch inside for £15."
I have been told that you can do repairs on the sidewall but the time required is lengthy which is why no one does it. cheaper to buy a new tyre for most cars.
What's the current view on second hand SQ5's there was a topic which was locked that raised this question seems like they may be firming up a bit in the run up to the new one arriving later this year?
"Just in process of changing mine Dec 2014 29,500 miles car spec in signature, offered £33k so £17k loss or 34% in 21 months.Bigger loss than I was expecting and no discount available on new car."
"Assume trade in price? Even so I normally base my car depreciation of what I would expect to pay per month to hire the same car, so in the case of the SQ5 I would see this at least £500 per month around £6000 PA odd way of doing your sums but it seems to work for me and if I ever do better than expected then that's a bonus. So over 2 years that's £12,000. I paid £46,000 for a similar spec'd car so if I get around £34,000 after around 2 years I wont be too upset."
"Markifa - Is that a by a dealer? I'm shocked for the prime reason that 2016 SQ5's with under 5000 are being listed at mid 40's. You, Sir have damn good price!"
Thought it may have been bit higher and was without negotiation because new car not built until November. Yes it was dealer against Macan GTS.
Well you have more interest in my part ex value than I do. Thanks for the research I'll take dealers offer then if it's a good price and be grateful.
"The price a dealer will offer for a 2nd hand car will obviously be affected by the price of the new car.i.e the more expensive the new car, the more room for negotiation the dealer has, especially if offering no discount on new.Without knowing the details of the talks you've had, I'mguessingif you were prepared to bluff, and show you're ready to walk away from the deal completely, you could get an extra couple of k on your trade in against a Macan, if that was his opening bid."
I'm sure I've read there is a new Macan due out next year?
There is a new cayenne next year.
the Audi guy on the phone alluded to the fact that they were 'having problems' and relying on a third party to try resolve this.i told them if they don't fix it i want a full refund on the car because they have sold me something not fit for purpose and they have breached the Trade Description Act by selling me a car with Google 'Send to Car' listed as one of it's features - that doesn't actually work!
rifleman said:is Google 'Send to Car'?finally - after 27 days of waiting - an Audi Customer Service Manager called me today - said they need the car into the garage to see why Google 'Send to Car' isn't working from any computer i use anywhere in the World.i did point out that even if i torched the car - this would not affect Google 'Send to Car' so then he backtracked and said he would speak to a 'MyAudi' expert about the fact that Google 'Send to Car' is not listed as 'active' in My Audi and get back to me on Monday.he also said that he would compensate me accordingly for not having one of the features of the car available to me.is nobody else experiencing this issue?Click to expand...I've never actually tried it but think I'll have a go.
"Dunno, never tried it. Just thought it may be a server type related thing???"
"Not used this previously, but I have set it up this morning and worked first time.I have used the option on the myaudilogin previously and that also works."
"thanks ICT, worked brilliantly on my MY14 Q5, won't work on this one.i reckon the best and easiest option would be for Audi to give my Q5 a new ID which i can register with Google, as this one blatantly isn't working."
Any guys on here been allowed to take their own oil to Audi at service time??Thanks.

"If you did all of the scheduled checks it would take longer, but you will know the job has been done properly."
"Thanks guys, not sure if Ayr Audi will accept me supplying the parts, but will findout.Notpaying £600.00 for this I will get indy to do it with genuine parts, and he guarantees it will not affect warranty."
"Will he guarantee that Audi will look favourably and contribute to your bill, if your car has an expensive problem just after warranty expires?"
Note that the service book is now electronic and only Audi dealers seem to have access?
"Yes, that would be my concern. How could one prove servicing has been carried out in accordance with Audi schedule? Given the choice between a vehicle with full dealer history or a pile of receipts from an independent, which 2nd hand car would you buy?"
I know but how can they justify £600 for major service?
I would suggest you try a.n.other dealer and/or get a quote and ask your dealer to price match.
"I've had cars with both, but i don't think you can compare a faulty dynamic system with the standard one.The system also leads to feeling even further detached from the from wheels in terms of feedback."
Having owned Audis specced both with and without I wouldn't choose it as an option again (my current Q5 doesn't have it). Audi handling is probably the weakest part of the package vs. the competition and testing side-by-side it's much better with the standard rack.Maybe I have to push a bit harder to spin the wheel in the car park but it's hardly like Ford Escort I drove as a teenager with totally unassisted steering!
"+1, I disliked ADS when I tried it. It made the steering feel even worse than standard. Vague and far too light steering is one of the few aspects I dislike about my SQ5 and the Q5 I had previously.PS: My wife prefers power steering on the Audi to the Porsche = says it all really?"
"I have Drive Select, but no Dynamic Steering. It was not available as an option on my mid-level trim package. My Q5's over-boosted (standard) power steering was one of my complaints, compared to my previous ride, a BMW 328 convertible. At slow speeds, it feels fine, but it never firms up sufficiently while driving, even when Drive Select is in Sport mode. It's just too soft for my preference. The Porsche Macan's steering felt spot on, though!"
"I prefer steering without too much assistance, I've got the normal rack on dynamic setting and actually quite like it. If you want the steering even heavier you can remove the servotronic relay which leaves the power steering but does away with the extra low speed assist, worked on the A4 anyway.On the A4 relays are interchangeable between models, i.e. you could put one from an S4 into an A4 to get less assistance, it will probably be the same on the Qs?"
"@SteveMak - I might be wrong but without the dynamic steering I think drive select is limited to engine management. I have the same set-up as you and I just drive in comfort the whole time. I don't think I've touched the settings for about 20k miles! And I agree re. the BMW comparison - I have a 135i as well and the steering is much more direct and the handling/feel better as a result. It's about the overall package though and I still like the Q5 as a family car even though it's not the last word in dynamic driving.That said if Macans were a little cheaper, and the waiting list a little shorter I would be in one like a shot!"
"I think Drive select is great, and I have it on 'Individual' setting,which for me is steering in 'Dynamic' (tightens it up nicely) and engine in ""Comfort', as I didn't buy it as a racing car."
"That's what I wanted to do, but can't. I discovered Individual model is available only when you get the Nav package, and I didn't."
"Hmm, pity.Not sure of the models in Canada, but in UK the Nav package comes with the S-line Plus, which I have"
"In Canada, we have 3 trim levels: Komfort, Progressiv, and Technik (yeah, with that wacky spelling). I got the mid-level because I didn't want to top-level's panoramic sunroof and some other options I didn't care for. Nav was an extra CAD$2800 (US$2,160, GPB 1,671). I'm not a fan of factory Nav systems, as I typically keep my car for well over a decade (18 years for my previous one)."
There is no 'when and why' answer. Every time you come to a stop it should engage and then disengage when you move off again.The whole idea of the system is to stop the need to maintain pressure on the brake pedal when stopped.
All the time.
"Would not be without it, used all the time."
"It's handy, stops the car creeping forward when you come to a halt, releases automatically."
Hill-Hold Assist - one of the greatest features of the car - but far more functional on normal roads than hills - should be renamed 'halt assist' - because that's exactly what it does - takes control of your car when you halt.i absolutely love it and i think i would actually die without it.well...
I use it all the time. Would not have a Q5 (or an s-tronic box) without it.
"We had it on our old q5 sline plus and found it pretty useless even to the point in slow moving traffic it came on once while we were still moving & the car came to a very abrupt stop ,dealer could find nothing wrong with it so we have left it off our sq5 plus and haven't missed it one bit but each to their own ????"
"Yeah agree - you don't really use it, it just happens. ""Forward creep"" is an inherent but unwelcome side effect of automatic engines and this removes it. If it was a default setting and someone suggested removing it you'd think they were mad.It's also great value on the Q5 I've noticed HHA, along with some other features like auto-dip headlights vary greatly depending on the model."
"I used to use it constantly, but stopped using it months ago and use it occasionally on really steep hills. Don't know if I will continue or start using it again."
"Yeh, I've been using it a bit since I started this thread..Seems ok, but I don't get why people couldn't live without it, just my personal opinion"
"Here's what Audi has to say about ""Hold Assist"":https://www.audi.co.uk/glossary/a/audi-hold-assist.htmlI don't know if my 2015 Q5 has this feature, as I don't see the button they mention. Something I like a lot, this being my first car with an automatic transmission (after 35 years of driving a car with a manual transmission): When I stop while going uphill, such as at a stop sign, I can safely release the brake pedal without rolling back, like I did with a standard transmission. I don't know if this is just the nature of all automatic transmissions or if it's a special something in (some/all) Audi cars, but it makes for a much more relaxing drive."
Definitely agree with the relaxing bit.
"I had a similar doubt prior to ordering my car as the demo didn't have it fitted (odd). For the money I thought, 'why not'! The upshot is that I'd say it is the most used 'extra' on my car, and I paid a lot for some of them... Can't understand cars not having this fitted as standard rather than paying some silly little extra cost. Like 'stop-start', you can always disable it if it offends.. Great addition to a great car."
"Kind of embarrassed to admit, I only found what this 'button' did 3 weeks ago......I've had the car 15 month.Now use it all the time."
"fishermon said:I only realised what HHA was AFTER I had received my SQ5 (my Q5 didn't have it), so it has bugged me ever since that I didn't order it because the car sits down at the back when I apply the handbrake.My other issue is when stationary at lights and the sequence means I have a couple of minutes to wait. If I sit with the foot-brake applied, the stop/start kicks in and stops the engine, but I am blinding the people behind with my brake lights (at night). If I then apply the handbrake and release the pressure off the foot-brake the stop/start starts the engine!!!So, if I want to wait any length of time with the engine off, I can't use the handbrake. This seems to be the wrong way round to me. Is this correct? I know I can switch the Stop/start off but I don't have an issue with it other than in this situation.What am I doing wrong?Click to expand...That is how the system is supposed to function. Vorsprung Durch Technik ???"

Thanks for the suggestion but this doesn't work either.Just something I'll have to put up with.Rest of the car keeps me smiling I'm glad to say.
"Have to say (admit) that since starting this thread, I've seen the simplicity and beauty of HHA.I just wish it could be explained as such, in the brochure and/or by the sales people ( mine said when buying both my brand new models 'I wouldn't bother with it)And, the amount of chat about it on threads such as these, show it's very misunderstood.My personal opinion is that with it being next too, and similar looking, to the handbrake function, unaware people think it has to be used as such on an individual basis every time its used.I did anyway, at first."
"Hi Fishermon - I had extensive experience of this in a very frustrating traffic jam on Sunday, during which I was stationary for long periods. If HHA is on, then stopping the vehicle and selecting park will cut the engine, regardless of whether you have your foot on the brake. This will though be overridden eventually if the engine is required to maintain the climate control."
they use chains not belts..mileage wont be a problem if its been serviced correctly.
Looks like it has been serviced in accordance to the book. Full Audi service history. Just a bit worried if there may be large bills awaiting me!!Any idea of how much Audi charge for the timing belt change?
cambelt on my 2011 2.0 diesel s line was done a couple of weeks ago by audi in kings lynn. £599 fixed price inc new water pump.
"I would not worry about high mileage, IF that is reflected in the price. That one looks good, inside and out but IMHO overpriced.I would advise that you check the auto box very carefully. Check the oil change history. Lookout for snatching which is a tell tale sign mechatronic and/or gearbox is on it's way out. This can be VERY expensive to replace.Cam chain should outlive the life of the car.Did you buy?"
Hi there and thanks for the replies.Although this one ticked all the boxes the milage did put me off.I'm now on the lookout for a Q5 with less than 60k on the clock.
"Hi.My car has an after market tow bar fitted (the same wiring as Audi fit) The dealers want to do a software update on the Air Con, but if they do I will have to go back to my tow bar supplier to have the car recoded.The update will reset the cars brain for no tow bar. Is there any way this can be over ridden??"
"Seems a bit unreasonable, if they wipe the tow bar settings can't they just reprogram it for you?"
"This is nonsense, not sure why they are saying this.See if you can find someone with VCDS (Vagcom) local to you, get a full scan done, save it, then get Audi to do their thing then recode afterwards with the VCDS owner. If you are near to me more than happy to help."
"My SQ5 is now 1 year old and has provided 33,000 enjoyable miles during this time. Having previously owned an A5, I am surprised that I still have loads of wear left on my tyres and would imagine that I will get 50,000 miles out of them. I am interested to find out what other SQ5 owners are getting?"
I've just put a deposit on a 3.0tdi s-line. It's done 23k miles and has 4mm tread left on the front. I'm not sure what make they are yet though. What make are yours?
After 30months rears are getting ready for change. 23k
Blimey - serious miles out of a set of boots.A3 Black Edition TDI Quattro - first set changed at 6k miles after a massive aquaplane on the mway gave me the indicatorA4 Avant Black Edition TDI - First set changed at 8k miles with PZeros which lasted about 20k miles a set all round.Both of the aboves I didnt have to pay for as the car was a company car (and to be fair I drove the A3 like it was designed to be driven) but the SQ5 that I collect tomorrow I will - so hearing this news has put a smile on my face!
what size wheels?
"you've done well therei've got 21 inch wheels. 20k miles on the clock now. i had to switch the fronts to the back at 12,000 miles to buy me some time. all 4 tyres are now due to change, down to legal limits. Pirellis of course :-("
"I had the fronts changed at 11,000 miles. Not changed the rears yet as only on 14,000 at the minute. That's on the 21"" wheels with Pirellis"
"I am running on 20"" Goodyear and wouldn't class myself as a steady driver. I do however do mostly motorway miles"
"I'm putting my second set on at 29,000 miles first set lasted only 13,000 both sets been Dunlops. Putting Pirellis on which I believe don't last as long but cars going in November but £50 tyre cheaper."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
Audi confirmed my 64 plate 2.0 tri 177 with ad blue is one . But the softwear update my lower my mpg and who knows wot else but audi can't confirm wot the update will do .
"Hi, Did you contact Audi or did they contact you? I have 2.0 Litre Q5 2011 quattro S line with ad blue don't know whether this is impacted?Update: Audi confirmed that my model is impacted"
Does anyone know if the update/fix impacts on performance? If it does can you opt out?
"Just rung Audi Uk, mine is one thats affected."
"Audi have confirmed that my MY2014 vehicle is affected. - i do NOT have adblue.they have said that a website will be set up over the coming days giving further info/advice.No details have been released to public as of yet on other parameters that may alter with proposed ""fix""."
Its going to be another PPI.http://www.slatergordon.co.uk/commercial-and-group-litigation/volkswagen-scandal-legal-investigation/
Petrol and V6 not affected according to Audi news
This give you info as well..http://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/owners-area/emissions.html
"What cars have Adblue, my car I believe to be a MY14 177PS has Adblue, yet I read on here that other MY14 cars do not have it fitted, is there any reason for this ?"
I have asked the same question. My 2015 doesnt yet I believe some earlier ones do and so do some later ones. I wonder why the inconsistency.
My 2013 177PS car has AdBlue - haven't checked if it's part of the recall yet
"My March 2015 has no ad blue but I think that is because it is the lower 150bhp 2.0 tdi, can't see them being able to remap our cars, more like a compensation plan to cover the differences we will all face after our cars have been re classified by the uk government"
"Local Audi dealer checked and confirmed this afternoon that my 2011 MY (Oct 2010) 2.0 TDi with Adblue will be subject to recall, but had no idea whether the recall would be just for a software patch or for new hardware."
"There has been speculation that affected cars would get Adblue hardware, but clearly it affects those with it already."
On BBC News government wont increase road tax on non compliant cars.
"Of course they won't, road tax is calculated on CO[sub]2[/sub] emissions, this problem relates to NOx emissions..."
Correct. Just repeating the news item.
"Hadn't read the news item, it's just logical... Also, it saved other people from bothering to ;-) Sharing the laziness..."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"Hey mate, just been lurkin'! My Q5 is amazing, I love it - but without any dumb questions to ask like my last one then I haven't felt the urge to post anythingHope you're well."
Glad to hear it Andy. It is an amazing car indeed!
"Just had it confirmed that my 64 plate S line Plus is affected (177ps with Ad Blue).The dealer had no idea on the fix or exactly when, just that it would be confirmed in writing by Audi soon.Interestingly (and rather annoyingly) my 2009 Golf is also affected (no Ad Blue). I checked this car via the VW website which now has a checker live."
"Mine has been confirmed 14 plate S line Plus as affected (177ps with Ad Blue).I was told I would receive a letter in the next 4 weeks for an assessment, then wait for more information."
Check if your UK car is affected on Audi UK website - Now livehttps://www.audi.co.uk/owners-area/emissions/check-your-car.html
"My 63 plate is now confirmed ............. watch this space. if this mod changes the performance I will not be having it done, as at the time of buying I wanted a 3 ltr TDI but was told by the dealer that the new 177PS was the better car ................"
better - on balance.. i guess..but only in that the performance is not night and day and the resale values.I don't think you can choose to not have it corrected as it won't be legal..
so this might mean those of us affected who purchased a 177PS 2.0l EC5 in good faith may end up with a remapped / legal Q5 with far less power in order to make it legally compliant - surely this is illegal that we don't end up with the product we purchased?!
And Audi would then be in breach of contract?
surely yes!i bought a 177PS car - that is not what i will have - not by unfortunate accident - but by deliberate deception.(that is assuming the only way you can make the car legally compliant with less emissions is to downgrade the power?)
I'm not sure it would be illegal as the cars are rated by CO2 omissions.
"agreed, but if we take a hit in power or performance to the specs of the car when we purchased it in good faith - then surely this will be illegal?"
"I would say yes, clear misrepresentation under Sale of Goods Act, not to mention probable criminal charges of Fraud by misrepresentation."
"Just used the Audi online checker -https://www.audi.co....k-your-car.htmlAnd it tells me that mine is not affected, but VW customer services said it was.Confused!"
Just checked mine and found it is affected. no surprise there then!
Well my guess is they will increase the flow rate on the AdBlue to absorb more NOx so you will have to refill the tank more often. There may be other tweaks done as well but A6's with the 190ps engine do seem to use it at a faster rate than the 177ps Q5.
"Just heard on news, recalls start January, simple software update. Some will require hardware work."
just checked mine and its not an ad blue one and its not a faulty one!I can go on driving safe it the knowledge that it is less pollution than an X5!some one once said when Toyota surpassed ford they were investigated.Now VW going through same.....
"What I don't understand, if it is a simple software update, why would they not have done that in the first place?"
Because to achieve the claimed NOX emissions levelPerformance and MPG will take a hitThe question now is do we have to accept a software update that will potentially negatively impact the carI hope its not a compulsory recall
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
I may be missing the point but surely the purpose of any update will not be to remove the 'cheating' element but instead to amend the engine so that the NoX emissions are in line with what was declared during the (cheated) test?
The 2.0TDI Q5 (and other manufacturer's smaller diesels e.g. the Freelander) often exhibit dangerous hesitation when taking away from junctions and at roundabouts.I wonder if massaging the ECU to satisfy economy emission control test figures could be a contributory factor to this behaviour?
"As far as I am aware, to date VAG have only declared they will remove the cheat element. Hopefully VAG will make it clear exactly what effect the proposed change(s) will have."
"simply removing the cheat will make all the cars illegal in the US, so surely any 'fix' will involve a lot more than just thatunless we have two different fixes for each continent"
Just been on BBC News some will require new injectors and catalytic converters.
"These works to our cars will not be completed until the end of 2016, if that is so I wonder how this will effect the value if we want to sell, that's if you can sell."
"@Dibs - I don't think it will have that much effect how long the recall works - anyone who is the legal owner at any time can send it in for ""correction"" - even if that's the end of 2016. I think we will know very soon what the actual effect of the corrective changes will be on performance, and that is what will set any adjustment in the resale value. Any compensation due from VW will probably follow from there."
I was called by Audi UK last night and they confirmed my car is affected (details in my signature).Im hoping this means a nice easy / free procees to be able to change / upgrade mine now.
Well not sure how I feel as traded my Q5 for new SQ5 in early September -before the scandal became known- not sure whether Audi would have been quite so generous with their trade in value for my Q5 if after this time. Checked the Audi checker site and Q5 was definitely one of the cars affected. However not clear as to whether any SQ5 is actually affected even the EU5 models. Have checked site and my EU6 is clear. Being completely cynical now but when I came to sell on will definitely state that my car was not part of the VW/Audi scandal not sure that all SQ5 owners will be able to do the same??
think again - i am in the process of an upgrade now and my dealer has stated that Audi are doing NOTHING to entice existing owners to stay loyal to Audi and upgrade - infact as of 1st October the catalogue price has risen 1.2% despite the low Euro to the Pound and the AudiGate scandal!
"All SQ owners can, the 30TDi was never impacted by the cheat (based on the released info from Audi)."
Mine is affected. The whole scandal has meant that all diesel engines are coming under scrutiny with calls to ban them from town centres etc etc. It will take time but it will happen in one form or another. I was about to replace mine (Q5 2.0tdi) with a newer similar model but am now rethinking - probably a non VAG group petrol or even hybrid is the future now.On a more immediate point. In the UK we can now join class actions and I see lawyers are already advertising this. I will keep an eye on this as I am seriously hacked off with Audi and expect my car to have worse performance/economy/engine life/and value after the recall...

"VW told me mine was affected, the Audi website told me i wasn't and now I have received the same letter, what the hell."
"I agree - but it looks to me as if this probably goes out on all their comms - generally the letter reads pretty poorly - but as I said in my other post, it would be very odd if they had accepted any liability in writing at this stage."
Well I did inform the DVLA six weeks ago but I still got a letter. Wheels turn slowly at the DVLA.
http://www.mirror.co.uk/money/volkswagen-drivers-could-3000-compensation-6550773Not sure if anyone has read this
I received my letter yesterday word for word per the VW letter above.
"Is everyone just out to get a bit of free money or what??? The software did not effect anyone and in the end made everyones cars cheaper to tax, so has saved the owner money. I could understand the government etc being angry about it, but us as customers . . . Really?People need to get a grip, a dimple software fix for most cars that people wouldnt even notice. Money grabbing bunch of w***s. You were all happy with your cars before, now all of a sudden its a disgrace, audi and VW are the devil. Grow up !!!! They still build the best cars, best quality"
Rifflemans comments is insensitive for people who've been shafted and robbed. The brand is literately destroyed
theres a reason why audi have used cheat tactics a simple software fix will fix the problem but with a negative impact. If people are thinking ' audi will fix the problem with no affect on performance' then one should think if that was the case why would they want to use cheat software in the first place. 'Manipulation of statistics'
So who actually looked at NOx emission figures before choosing their car? I certainly didn't as thy were not easily available e.g. in the sales brochure..............
"Well I definitely checked the EU5/EU6 status of the vehicle which is effectively the same thing. I was actually wavering on an X3 rather than the Q5 even through I didn't like it as much simply because the engine was EU6.That's kind of irrelevant though - the point is that if the software cheat and the fix for NOx starts to affect the things that everyone looks at and bases there decision on - namely MPG, residuals and performance, then owners have a right to be upset!"
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"rifleman said:texactly - these are not the cars we thought we thought we bought based on any of the above.i called the number on my Audi letter last night and unleashed hell on them - i didn't give them inch, got the supervisor involved who told me ""you can seek an independant third party to assist with any claim"" - ""did Audi seek an independant third party to install illegal software on my car?"" was my reply!to that end, i got them to log a formal complaint between me and Audi entitled ""owner wants a full refund for mis-sold vehicle"" - not that i am expecting that to happen but i wanted to let them know that their letter without an apology was outrageous, as was their claim that ""a software update will rectify the situation"".call Audi on 0800 093 0124 and get your official complain logged - voice your discontent!Click to expand...The number I was given was 0800 699 888. I also registered a complaint."
"My question with residuals is how will you ever know how much less your car is worth? They can hide it and put it down to other things, thats how it works"
"There are a lot of stats available around the trade auction prices and it will be pretty obvious if EA189 engined vehicles take a step down vs. compliant ones, or even if VAG in general start to track at a different trajectory vs. rivals than before.Agree it's a bit subjective - but this won't be VAG or a dealer making this decision - it would be the government regulator making a judgement."
"Residual value is all about demand and supply. Supply of the affected cars hasn't changed but demand sure has therefore the values will fall. How much, no one knows just yet. For sure there are a load of dealers sitting with affected cars which no one is going to buy until the fix is well known and tested. So in that while my car isn't affected I do agree that owners have a legitimate claim.However what about owners of unaffected models such as my SQ5. If the general tide goes against the VAG brands then values may also drop due to lower demand, do we have any recourse I wonder."
"the deliberate installation of illegal softare into the vehicles of those of us affected tarnishess the whole Audi brand and not jsut us who run an EU5 engine.i would say absolutely YES - you will be affected and it will take about 5 years for this to go away, if not more.log a complaint with Audi - get your grievance in there officially now and they have to address it.best of luck my friend."
Well my EU5 Q5 sold in less than two weeks so somebody wanted one.
What a shambles I've a June 15 plate 177 Tdi SLine Plus.....when I entered my details on Audi website last week I was told I'm not effected today I receive a letter saying I am . I was told EU6 engines are not effected they clearly are even my Audi dealer didn't have a clue what's going on ! I hope Audi UK read this forum
First I have heard that EU6 engines are affected - where did you get that information from?
"I sold my 61 plate 170ps manual (non ad blue) car to my parents, today they received a letter from Audi UK informing them they were in possession of a car requiring remedial action. The letter went on to say that this will begin in January and they will be contacted then."
Simply the fact that my car has an EU6 engine and I've been told it has a problem my dealer was also surprised !
If this is the case that it does affect EU6 then the plot thickens.And it does......http://www.wral.com/2016-vw-diesels-have-new-software-affecting-emissions-tests/14968541/
"It's quite unbelievable rang Audi this morning as helpful as a chocolate teapot......I thought my car had an EU6 engine, this I was assured by my Audi dealer as my car was manufactured in April 15 , I took delivery June 1st , I now have my doubts over this as i'm being told my car has an EA189 engine what ever that is . From not being concerned I'm now very concerned , as PR exercise and keeping customers informed VW/Audi should hold its head in shame. I've now registered with Slater and Gorman as in my opinion it's quite simple , I did not purchase the vehicle I was led to believe by Audi and I want it sorted"

Could not have written it better myself - brilliant!
Older engines now being examined: VW to investigate another engine type for 'cheat device'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34601593
"The emission figures on my Q5's V5 are I assume, incorrect. The DVLA who issued this document must therefore have been misled.I wonder if there are legal implications for this. I find myself in posession of a document with fraudulant details."
does it state NOx emissions on the V5 or just CO2?
Tried to post photo but always get Too Big.Nox is 0.149(gm/km or gm/KWh)HC+Nox is 0.187(gm/km)
"yes indeed - it's all a lie now and not worth the paper it's written on - however i would also caveat that by saying trhe fact thta we have it in black and white on an official government document is worth something when compensation is forthcoming, and i feel it must - eventually."
"There is view that the ""Defeat Software may not have been activated for EU testing merely present. If this is the case it will just be removed."
"i don't remember 'Defeater' being listed as 'fitted as standard' on my Q5, and I certainly didn't add it as an 'extra' - so they lied to me.feckers!"
"Yawnnnnn, compensation i think not. Build a bridge and get over it i have and most people i know dont care. Tv and media hype doesnt help"
i'm not the type to just roll over like that.anyone i know (Audi / VW / Skoda / Seat owners) who have been affected are all livid.i'll have my pound of flesh.
"Good luck, jump on the band wagon.I hope the comment around 4 up is right and it was never used during the testing stage, wipe the smiles off peoples money hungry faces"
"'...wipe the smiles off people's money hungry faces...' - I can only assume you are referring to those people in Audi - because they fitted this software to cheat tests so they could sell more cars and make more millions, and not those of us who were deliberately deceived and sold vehicles fitted with illegal software who will lose money on the residual value of our cars, right?"
"Haha, i can bet you any money everyone would have still bought there car either way, just the not knowing about the software has made everyone angry. Dont get me wrong i get that but still i think 99.9% of people would still be in the same car if they hadnt added software and the car not be quite so green"
I wouldn't have bought the diesel version if the figures had been known at the time.
"Really?? Cant say i believe that, i wouldnt care what emissions my car gives out id still drive it"
"My car isnt effected, i also spent alot on a brand new sq5 with alot of spec. At the end of the day if its worth 2k less when i trade then fair enough, ill still jump into a new audi again next.Its not cos im not soft or dont have a back bone, the fact is i just done give a f**k, ive lost countless thousands on cars over the yrs so another couple wont kill me. Still being offered top top money for SQ5 from people asking to buy it not me sell it to them"
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"good for you, but i and tens if not hundreds of thousands of other owners affected do give a f**k - that we have paid tens of thousands for a brand new car which is deliberately fitted with something illegal, and this is why Audi must be held to account.i rest my case."
Your car is no different now than when you bought it apart from now you have foubd out it has some software. Wowsers !!!
"the difference is - I would never have touched it if I knew it was fitted with anything illegal.my car is very different now than when I bought it - nobody knew it was fitted with anything illegal - now everyone knows.I would not own this car if I knew then what I know now.Audi's fault, not mine."
"Physically it is the same as when we purchased the car, the technical specs documented against the car are not. Therefore the car is not what we agreed to purchase."
"and nowhere in the brochure or in the salespersons pitch did it mention it was fitted with anything illegal, but now Audi have confirmed to us that our cars were deliberately fitted with something illegal that they installed themselves.Audi didn't just cheat emissions they cheated their customers.thankfully those people who ""don't give a f**k"" are in the minority otherwise this would all be a case of ""oh dear, never mind"" and Audi ""wouldn't give a f**k"" either."
"........ More to the point, it is what detracts from the car's performance, value and longevity in making it comply that if these suffer, will require compensation."
"If its that illegal it would be law by the government to change it. There is no rule to say you have to get it done. Audi dont really seem to care either by the way there going about it, so i wouldnt expect a ten grand cheque at your door or a red carpet rolled out next time you enter a showroom"
Apparently an article in the Mail says Leigh Day solicitors are starting a class action against VW group unless they sit around the table and discuss compo - seems this could end up possibly similar to PPI. Mine is one of the cars affected Q5 S line Spec Ed 1st reg May 2010. I have placed an order for a new SQ5 just before all this news broke I will be interested to see what happens as I have agreed a PX price on my current car. I was also in the local VW dealership the other day and there seemed to be rather busy - and that was midweek. So I wonder if this has affected the Group as such.
From what ive seen no it hasnt. Sales seem the same
"The Euro 5 Q5 I traded-in in September sold within 10 days, and that was after the news broke."
"the difference is - these people now know the car is fitted with something illegal and i am sure it is one of the first questions any buyer of an EU5 engine will ask therefore they can choose to buy it or not, we never for a moment suspected our cars were fitted with anything illegal and that the figures quotes on the V5 were accurate and based our decision on the fact that it was as far as we knew not fitted with anything illegal.how wrong we were..."
"I have never looked at figures on the V5 to help me decide what car to buy, infact ive never looked at the figures atall. If you do then thats the first person ive ever heard of do that."
"I think you are using the wrong argument. It is not the software that is illegal (there is no legislation written around software), it is the fact that the engines do not meet the regulations that is illegal. The software is there to hide the fact that the emissions do not meet the legislation. Perhaps a bit pedantic but hey-ho."
"Yes its not the software that is illegal, nor does anyone look at the NO2 figures before they buy their car, and probably does not care. But I think the big argument here that if the car is not EU5 compliant, it must be EU4. So if the brochure said EU5 but the car was EU4 and every other competitive car was EU5 then I think that is a strong claim for misrepresentation. You probably need to recall the basis upon which you purchased the car. Would you have bought a EU4 car?"
"No, but that is what they supplied me with by the looks of it."
"Exactly my point the whole time, but some people seem to claim they do and that they wouldnt buy a car dependant on that, sorry but i say B*ll s**t"
Just because you didn't consider it doesn't mean that no-one does and I'd suggest more people should be considering it as it will affect the value of their vehicle and it's future useability. Low emissions zones in major cities are going to have a massive effect on the cost of driving diesel cars in town centres which will be directly linked to EU4/5/6 status.I knew precisely what EU number car I was buying and was aware that it was NOT best in class in that respect (even in 2013 BMW X3 engines were all EU6 and as far as we know not cheating the tests). On balance I chose the Audi anyway - but it factored into my decision.
Im not saying no one knows just that very few knew in compared with the complaints about it now.
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"For me its simple,I bought a car from Audi trusting it was road legal and satisfied all regulations and legal requirements, whatever they were.It doesnt, they lied.Its now a question of what detracts from the cars performance to enable it to comply.If nothing .... FineIf its worse .... Compensation."
This is one of the reasons that I choose to trade my A6 tdi in for a petrol because if the fix does ruin the car performance then I know the value will drop so it best for me to off load it now while the trade in is good.
"Sj1000 said:Correct,To the few posters saying that some Q5 owners are 'over-reacting', or that 'they wouldn't previously know, or care, about the emissions', or 'even know whether they have an EU4, 5, or 6,'No doubt 99% correct on the latter two, but they also wouldn't now be having to consider 'their best next move' through no fault of their own.Their only crime having being to pay around £40k for a 'prestige' car in good faith, but now having to spend their valuable time reading reports, news items, forums, innocuous letters from the manufacturers, rumours, and having to consider what to do.All because of one reason......VW got caught!!That's VW's problem, not the buyers,We didn't ask for this dilemma, we've been handed it, so either sort it respectfully, or expect legal action.Click to expand...Well said !There appears to be a belief amongst huge corporations and multi national companies that they can simply do what they want when they want with impunity e.g. Major banks, VW , FIFA, etc etc.Only when senior management are gripping the rail and pondering their future behind bars will things change. This is organised crime with an outward appearance of respectability."
"See i agree with you on that point, yes id argue about the value of my car afterwords.But you were preaching emissions and EU5 4 6 whatever before which you said bothered you, thats what i didnt agree with as not many people u dont think are bothered about anything apart from value of there vehicles, which i agree with"
"It's also about whether the paperwork matches up after the 'fix'i.e do I still have a 177 ps Audi, because if it drops to 173, 174, whatever.. then it's an illegal document surely, and not what I ordered"
"Although VW Group are holding their hands up here I rather suspect (and have had it confirmed by a well informed source) that it isn't actually something VW have done and the smoking gun is actually in the hands of Bosch who also manufacture the fueling/ECU systems for almost all the German manufacturers. Will be interesting to see how it all pans out, the press etc will lose interest and move on to something else before long."
"Pg220 said:I've contacted Audi UK twice this month regarding this seeking some reassurance as to resale values and also conformation that my replacement Q5, which was built last week, will not be affected.I have received one automated reply saying I will be contacted shortly, that was three weeks ago. After that, nothing. Like Rifleman I am F****** furious and considering my options.I have one major concern.I ordered my replacement Q5 (S-Line + 2.0ltr TDI S-Tronic) in September. The technical data quoted in the Q5 official documentation brochure was printed in April 2015 and refers to the car as a model year 2016 with an EU 6 standard engine.As no one was publicly aware of the software cheat at the time the brochure was printed, or indeed at the time I ordered my car is it fair to assume one of the following1. The new car will also have dubious software fitted in order to meet the current standards2. it will not have software fitted and therefore the technical data as per the printed documentation will be incorrect and i will have no idea of the true technical data or performance of my new car.3. Audi already know what the effects of removing this software has on technical data and performance of recently built cars but are not willing to disclose it at this time. Therefore one can assume they already know what effect the recall remedy will be on vehicles classed as effected.Click to expand...or 4. The new engine, combined with an increased flow rate of AdBlue, meets the emissions requirements.One can only hope."
"I think a reasonable solution would be that anyone who bought a new (affected) Audi from dealership, should be able to now return the car and keys to them, and collect a new (unaffected) replacement from them.Might try that tomorrow"
I am considering signing up with on of the legal firms who are chasing Audi for compensation - anyone done similar and who with?
"lol i tried that and didn't get very far, but i haven't given up yet."
my workmate is doing just that with his Skoda - i'll keep you posted here as to how he progresses.
"I was told today by a trader friend of mine that on October the 1st this year the law changed in favour of consumer in the fact that any car bought from any trader or dealer that has (any) fault within 30 first 30 days of ownership is entitled to a full no quibble refund,and the customer doesn't have to let the garage put it right,so surely this scandal would come into this new law ????"
Except that the latest cars are supposed to be Euro 6 compliant and they have yet to be proven not to meet the regulations. If they were proven to be non-compliant that would be a different matter I guess.
I am still shocked that Audi cannot confirm if our cars fitted with the dodgy software are EU compliant or not.
"If a car is fitted with ""dodgy software"" it is pretty safe to assume it is not compliant with the emission regulations."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."

Audi and Porche on the BBC breakfast news this morning denying any involvement. So why do I have a letter from Audi at home telling to await their recall notice???
"I won't be overly concerned by any impact on emissions, but still agree it's a scandal that all these cars were sold with false credentials. I expect all that will happen is a small amount of compensation, a free service? Maybe not but I doubt there will be any mass acceptance that people are due anything significant. I hope I'm wrong."

Assuming this includes the EU5 SQ5 engine?Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
I wouldn't rely too much on what the Audi Website is telling you about whether your car is affected or not as clearly this sites data was formed on the basis of what VW admitted to from the start. Now that there is a ? over whether they have used defeat software in their V6 engines we will have to wait for this to develop before you can really trust their data base. Or am I wrong thinking this? In the meantime I will contact the mighty Advisory service called Audi Customer Services to ensure that my concerns are recorded and they will then have an obligation to contact me to confirm whether my car aMY2016 SQ5is implicated. My gut feeling is that it will be as why would VW/Audi not want to use this type of cheat device in their larger engines as well as the smaller ones!!
"Oh dear - just seen that petrol engines may also now be implicated in a seperate VW CO2 issue:Volkswagen says 800,000 cars may have false CO2 levelshttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34712435At this point thinking I may be better off avoiding Audi altogether!"
"That was exactly my thinking when I was recently buying a second car - I had been looking at a TTS, but I went with a BMW petrol for precisely that reason.That said - the more VAG engines are called into question, the more I doubt that other manufacturers can have been operating entirely within the rules."

"Apparently Audis sales haven't dropped:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34731703However given the escalation / increase in scandal scope over the last few days you'd have to guess the next set of figures may reflect this.As someone who was ready to pull the trigger on a q5 purchase up until a few days ago, I can't really justify buying right now.

I suppose SQ5 owners need to consider what they will do when they find out their car is also implicated by this scandal. I have had my concerns recorded with Audi Customer Services for starters and not sure whether to contact the dealership I bought from in September but they have been crap so far with other issues so will probably just stick with ACS for now.

Compo? Keep those dreams coming...................
I can see VW coming close to folding over this. or at least the group getting split up to cover the costs.This is going to be huge...
I agree.... The VW brand may become toxic..... Then again they've survived 2 previous scandals....I think it will be difficult for them to split up... But I can see some of the group being sold off such as Porsche and Bentley... I also think people are smart enough to know that the quality of the cars are still very good and it's unfortunate that this scandal also coincides with massive focus on global warming and at the cross roads of electric vehicles becoming more popular.......Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Things seem to have gone a bit quite on this forum re the scandal and whether it affects the SQ5!! Any news anyone?
"You have to laugh ..........VW offers US customers $1,000 vouchers as gesture of goodwillhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34763777"
Went on Audi Uk site and punched in the VIN for my SQ5 snd they have confirmed it is NOT affected. It's 2015 model regidtered in January this year with the Euro 5 engine so hopefully all us SQ5 owners can now relax a little.
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
or it is too early yet for the 2015 Audi's to be affected. No one can really relax until this sorry state of affairs is cleared up properly.
and what do we get !! Naff all at the moment
Yep ain't that the truth!!
I've just had a look on the Audi & VW sites & it appears my previous 2 cars are both affected! I'm hoping the current one doesn't make it a hat-trick. Now I wonder if I'll get compensation for the years I owned them...Not likely!
Has anyone had discussions with a solicitor directly or have people just signed up to the groups taking collective action? Surely sale of goods act applies here?

While all the UK based 3.0 Q5 and SQ5 owners wait to find out 'Officially' that their beloved cars are affected by the emission scandal why don't we have a bit of fun and start a poll on who thinksYes AffectedandNot Affected.

"hi Treacle,i've been away with work so not had my eye on the ball on this at all but i'll look at this now thanks.i think Audi UK are chancing their arm and trying to wiggle out of this quietly as they can, but they won't be able to so long as we don't let them walk all over us and put up a bit of a fight.you should all be getting a call soon no doubt - do not accept closure and tell them you want your case escalated."
Any word if the SQ5 if affected yet? More out of interest than anything
that would be a big fat YES for the SQ5...
"Thanks,Have signed up with Slater and Gordon."
Read GRANDDUC's thread properly and you will clearly see that he in his words is having some fun and suggesting a straw poll aticipating the SQ5 will be affected but like the rest of us owners of the 3.0 litre engine we have no confirmation of this from Audi. Strange that some people are demanding blood from Audi and a full refund of their vehicle but then still want to order snother one.
Yes you are quite right I am just having a bit of fun but with serious undertones as I really don't believe that VW/Audi would only have doctored their smaller engine cars. But who knows I might be wrong!!
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"Still want to order another one.Still in a position to order one.Still have not ordered one because of this - that is the difference.I love the Q5 but hate Audi for what they have done.Audi deliberately hurt our cars and the brand, so I'll happily draw blood where I can."

"Each to their own of course. In my view, life's not so short that we don't need to be thinking about residuals and looking ahead to the next purchase. I bought my Q5 because I wanted to as well, but I was also clear about the (once) rock-solid residuals. I'm not so sure about them now though...."
"It seems that this forum has a lot of people from the UK. I am in the US, and we are seeing a lot of controversy with USEPA emissions testing of VW's TDI engines. Have you seen similar in UK or EU"
@sigq5Is that controversy over the results (due to cheat software) or the testing methods themselves??

"I bought my 10 plate Golf second hand from an Audi dealer in 2011, it's on the list.I intended keeping it but am now wondering if I should offer it as trade it in against the SQ. I can see how non VAG dealerships would use this as an excuse to devalue the car but surely VW/Audi would have to offer a good price or risk totally undermining their claim that residuals are not affected?Is anyone, who recently traded in an affected car, able to comment?"

Panorama on now (8:30pm)

I called Audi Customer Nervous sorry should have said Service about 3 weeks ago when the 3.0 diesel engines were implicated in the USA but have had no call back yet. Will wait a while longer to see if this story has any legs but I'm convinced that the bigger diesel engines will be implicated soon.
"Pg220 said:Haven't had a chance to view Panorama yet but heres an update on my storyOrdered a new Q5 in September for delivery next week. Emissions saga blew up not long afterwards.Contacted Audi UK on two occasions seeking reassurance that used values would not be affected and that the new vehicle was not fitted with any devices and was as described in technical data. No assurances were forthcoming, indeed no response was ever received from Audi UK.Contacted dealer two weeks ago warning that I would cancel my order if no assurances were forthcoming about new vehicle. He was unable to guarantee anything and has obviously been put in a very difficult position by Audi UK.Not long after it became apparent that VW, through their website had apologised to their loyal customers and were offering loyalty bonuses to potential purchasers of up to £1500.Rang dealer again last Tuesday to be told no such offerings would be forthcoming from Audi UK and he agreed that the way AUK were dealing with their customers left a great deal to be desired.At this point I cancelled the order and he admitted I was not the first and won't be the last. There were no quibbles regarding the refund of the deposit.Wednesday I placed an order for a Mercedes GLC.This weekend I advertised my current Q5 and sold it privately last night.This morning I received a call from the Audi dealer telling me that Audi UK were now offering a £2000 loyalty bonus if I went ahead with the purchase. Told him it was a bit late and that I was even more pissed off with AUK now!I then rang him back with a view to going ahead with the order to be told that it was dependant on me Part Xing my current Q5 which of course I could no longer do.So here's the sum total of my feelings.Been a loyal VAG customer for 26 years and had a new Q5 on order. It is then established that the largest motor company in the world has systematically been deceiving every man and his dog about the technical and performance details of their vehicles. A great deal of planning went into this deception at probably the highest levels. What the f***wits didn't plan for of course was being caught.Each arm of VAG it seems is then left to independently explain to its customers what they have done and what they intend to do about it. Is it unreasonable to expect a level of service commensurate with Audis standing in the pecking order?Well, what you actually get, is a pro forma letter telling you they have f****d around with your car without your knowledge but they are going to fix it with as little inconvenience as possible, and don't worry because they don't expect you to pay for the fix. Don't know what the effects will be on your vehicles but tough s**t. It is this contempt for its customers and their typically high horse approach that has me pissed off.Apology for being lying cheating corporate organised criminals? Reassurance about the value of your second most expensive asset? Compensation for putting you in the position they have done? Thanks for standing by us at this difficult time and being such a loyal customer?&#8230;&#8230; No, not even a kiss my arse. They then have the temerity to warn me that if I sell the vehicle I must inform DVLA, like it has anything to do with them!For me this is about a point of principle, I'm not an eco warrior but I will try to do my bit where possible. I even put up with that stupid stop start function in the misguided belief that i'm playing my part. If only I knew that I was belching out more shit than a Chinese power station. The fact is another large corporation thinks they can do what they want, when they want, with impunity and with no regard for the consequences of their actions and the effects on its customers. So we can now add VAG to the long list of corporate thieving scumbags.I'm only one person, but I take solace that firstly I've done my bit and voted with my feet. Audi have lost a loyal customer to one of their rivals and secondly I believe someone will ultimately have to answer for their actions. I sit here imagining Martin Winterkorn sharing a prison cell with Sepp Blatter and it gives me a lovely warm feeling.Click to expand...Hi pg220 who was the dealer offering the £2000 as I have a new one on order thanks"
"Tying the loyalty bonus to having to trade a car in is again sharp practice. They therefore plan to shaft you over the trade in value and then say they have given an extra 2000. The VW bonus does not rely on a trade in, all you have to prove is that you owned a VW vehicle for a certain length of time. Much fairer treatment and it certainly seems VW are more open and apologetic, Audi are playing the high horse prestige manufacturer but they forget they are lying cheats. My first Audi and if it is effected and looses value they will struggle to retain my custom."
"Oh dear, I'm not going to be happy if the 'fix' for my SQ involves reducing the power..."
"Think it's probably wise not to go ahead with any purchases at the moment - my two month old, 1500 mile SQ5 has shed nearly £17,000 of its £51,000 list price. To say the trade is a little nervous would be an understatement."
"But thats normal... its nothing to do with this...SQ is now replaced by SQ+, extras = 0, and I'm pretty sure all SQs did the same..If its on PCP - why would you care?"
Shrewsbury Audi.
Anyone know the latest on diesel 3.0 engines and whether they are affected or not? Seems that UK cars don't appear to have broken any rules but the 3.0 models in the US have been dragged over the coals!!
Don't exactly agree with the SQ5 being replaced by SQ5 Plus as this is not the case with Q5 S-Line and Q5 S-Line Plus but I know there are differences with extra power on the new SQ5 Plus model. Problem with the SQ5 Plus it forces you to have options that you might not want shame they didn't give buyers choices it would have made the + a much more attractive proposition.
"Steve, I can appreciate your anxiety. It is a shame that this issue has put you off what is a fantastic car.I was interested to note that the NoX emissions for the Zafira were much worse than the VW under the Panorama test conditions."
"Cheers Missile,Yep, I'm pretty hacked off about the whole thing, in some ways I wish I hadn't done any more googling after placing the order and remained blissfully ignorant. I'm certain the car will be a cracker but it's a gamble I've decided not to take.Having said that I'm still fairly confident I'll have one in the drive yet.Funnily enough when I was breaking the bad news to the salesman, who was brand new, he brought up the Zafira test as well. We agreed that other manufacturers will no doubt soon be found out which may deflect some of the heat from VW, thankfully though my 'Vauxhall days' are long gone."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
Yes but what about EU6 3.0 Diesel engines surely the jury is still out on this?
"You're quite right - jury is still out, but there seems to be an issue over CO2 emissions with the european 3 litre diesels as per the press articles. My local Audi dealer is remaining coy, but there seems to be some unforeseen delays over the delivery of the 3 litre diesels across the whole range&#8230;."
As we are all aware if you contact Audi Customer Services all they do is type your details into the 'Computer' and then say engine not affected but clearly the 'Computer' is saying No at the moment when in fact it should probably be Yes!! How long do 3.0 diesel owners have to wait for a final definitive answer!!
@Pg220 - BMW have also categorically stated they do not use emissions cheat software (I don't think they are telling their dealers to hand out letters though). That's why like you I went for a BMW instead of the Audi I was considering when I bought a 2nd car recently.Seems there's a huge number of people making this switch at the moment. Some people seem to think it will be hard to prove that this scandal will affect the values of VAG vehicles going forwards but I think there is going to be a clear decline in them vs. other premium German brands and owners are going to demand and be given compensation (voluntarily by VAG or mandated by government)
"Pg220 said:JulesWhen did you receive that letter. Mine arrived yesterday over a month after I asked the question.Here's the full versionFrom&#8230; Audi UK Customer ServicesSubject: AU-2015/11-000461Dear Mr GThank you for your email dated 28 October to Audi UK.I would like to assure you that the Volkswagen Group is working hard to develop technical solutions for the affected dieselvehicles to correct any issues with the emissions characteristics of NOx, in relation to the testing regime of the vehicles andis working with the relevant authorities in this regard. Once approved, we will provide you with more details regarding how andwhen the technical solutions will be implemented.At the moment, the technical details of the fix and the timescales for implementing the fix have been provided to the relevantauthorities and are awaiting their approval. We have agreed a timetable with the relevant authorities that the solution willstart to be implemented from early 2016. We are in close liaison with the Department of Transport. The provisional timetablecommunicated to the KBA and shown to the VCA is as follows:Engine Approval Intended Start of Fix roll outEA189 2 litre Jan/Feb 2016 Week 9 2016EA189 1.2 litre April/May 2016 Week 22 2016EA189 1.6 litre July/Aug/Sept 2016 Week 39 2016The above timeline is subject to finalisation of the technical solutions and approval by the relevant authorities (KBA, VCA andMDI).In more detail, Volkswagen Group is developing a software solution for the 1.2 and 2.0 litre EA189 engines. For the 1.6 litreEA189 engine, the company will provide not only a software update but also a technical solution for the exchange of hardwarecomponents within the engine. These proposed technical solutions will be subjected to an in-depth qualitative analysis andapproval by the relevant authorities (KBA, VCA and the MDI). This will be undertaken with as little inconvenience to thecustomer as possible.In the meantime I can confirm that the NOx emissions testing issue does not change the fact that your car remains technicallysafe and roadworthy. It has been approved by an independent approval authority, which means it is legally allowed to be drivenon the roads.The NOx emissions testing issue relates only to NOx emissions levels in testing. There is also no evidence that the NOxemissions testing issue impacts the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels, fuel consumption or any other specification of theaffected vehicles in real world driving.In relation to the re-sale value of your car several factors will affect the value of your car, including its condition, thetime of year you are looking to sell and dealerships' independent stock profile. However, affected used cars are still beingsold. Further, there has been no change to Audi's trade-in policy as a result of this issue, and so, should you wish to, youwill be able to trade-in your car at a Audi dealership without issue.The Volkswagen Group are continuing to monitor resales of affected vehicles. Industry experience has shown that even when therehas been a safety recall (which this issue is not), there is no identifiable impact on resale values.With regards to your new vehicle, we would recommend that you contact the Audi centre where the vehicle is on order, so they canadvise if your vehicle is one of those affected.I am sorry you have had reason to contact us and appreciate your patience during this time.Yours sincerelyTara WilliamsonCustomer Relations AdvisorAudi UKT 0800 699 888ECustomer.Services@audi.co.ukClick to expand...Hi Pg220,I received my letter on 20/11/2015 this was the reassurance I was looking for, now I have it in writing from Audi UK any issues regarding emissions going forward the vehicle will be returned for a full refund.I received my letter on 20/11/2015 this was the reassurance I was looking for, now I have it in writing from Audi UK any issues regarding emissions going forward the vehicle will be returned for a full refund."
'Full' refund - or trade price?
that's word for word what Audi UK said to me when they called me to tell me about the letter they were sending - which i don't know if i received yet as i am working away from home for a few weeks.it's an attempt by Audi UK to dumb down the issue and doesn't change a thing - and certainly does NOT entitle you to a full refund as far as i can tell - what makes you think otherwise and how does it re-assure you?
"I have in writing from Audi UK that my vehicle is fitted with a EU6 engine that's not affected by the emissions testing issue, the latest October Audi Q5 sales brochure also states that the 2.0 TDI engine is EU6 compliant, so as far as I'm concerned if there turns out to a problem further down the road I would have a fairly good case as the vehicle would not be as described."
Are any EU6 diesel engines affected?
"So why didn't Audi UK simply tell me that as my new car has an EU6 engine it is not affected by this issue? Why are Audi UK telling you one thing and me another, only a few days apart?The lack of clear and unambiguous guarantee that the new engine is free of anything dodgy, just confirms what I thought, I'm better off out of it!"
Pg220 To me your letter from Audi reads as if your car would have come with an EU5 EA189?
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"At the point of ordering my replacement (september 2015) the latest manufacturers technical details were contained within their brochure dated and valid April 2015.It clearly states the engine emission standard is ""EU6"", however I have just noticed a mark alongside this which states ""The addition of AdBlue technology ensures compliance with EU5 emission standards""So as we now know that is a load of bollocks and it is not EU5 compliant what does that mean for EU6 compliance???????"
"Pg220 said:At the point of ordering my replacement (september 2015) the latest manufacturers technical details were contained within their brochure dated and valid April 2015.It clearly states the engine emission standard is ""EU6"", however I have just noticed a mark alongside this which states ""The addition of AdBlue technology ensures compliance with EU5 emission standards""So as we now know that is a load of bollocks and it is not EU5 compliant what does that mean for EU6 compliance???????Click to expand...I reckon they have increased the flow rate of AdBlue. A friend with an EU6 compliant A6 reported that his warned of needing a top-up at 6,000 miles and I think the size of tanks are broadly similar.I wonder who has the most miles on an EU6 Q5 currently? Mine has only 2,500 miles."
"it uses around 5ltrs (5%) per 100ltrs, so if its 6k miles that sounds correct.If it was about the future, diesel would be banned already.. the particulates are still carcinogenic with the EU6 legislation.."
"Diesel cars, which were once hailed as environmental saviours, are now seen as the 21st-century equivalent of Victorian chimney stacks, belching noxious fumes over cyclists, pedestrians and homes.I find it hard to accept UK government were so short sighted. Did they no know or did they not care? IMHO this is the real scandal."
"You missed the point entirely, many people believed because our government ""experts"" told them it was so."
"Well diesel became popular because the green lefties had a push around climate control and CO2 emissions, no one stop to think about what the alternate was doing, so while its true the CO2 is less, the other gasses are much worse.At some point people will wake up to the fact global warming is much more complex and the models work over periods much longer than exhaust fumes can be measured by.. Population control is the only way to reduce the impact of humans on the planet."
It should be remembered that the first time you top-up your AdBlue in a new car will not be reflected in the miles the car has covered as the tank may not have been completely full when leaving the factory therefore may not be holding the 20+ltr that the tank takes. As there is no AdBlue gauge you will never know until the warning pops up to fill-up in nnnMiles.
"SteveMak said:Itwasn't""...our government 'experts'..."" who told us that VAG's diesel are environmental saviors, or that they get great fuel economy. Government agencies just [a] defined legal emission levels,defined the testing methodology to ascertain if a vehicle violates those laws (i.e., unrealistic in-lab test only), and [c] defined the methodology to determine fuel economy. It wasVAGwho figured out how to game the system to get great in-lab emissions numbers while doing badly in real-world conditions, and how to game fuel economy numbers (e.g., overinflating tires, adding diesel to motor oil to thin it out for tests, etc.). VAG came up with those numbers, and reported them to government agencies. Government agencies just passed those numbers onto consumers, without validating them. Consumer entities and organisations, such as car reviewers and product analysts (e.g., America's Consumer Reports) just repeated those emission numbers to the public (some performed their own real-world fuel economy tests). And of course, VAG marketing also reiterated their falsified emissions and fuel economy numbers to consumers.In my view, governments around the world were caught with their pants down by thinking that an in-lab test reflects real-world conditions for emissions. They were also naive to think that the auto industry's self-policing is effective for monitoring and compliance, especially when it's so easy to see the huge incentives they have to misrepresent (Hint... profit).BTW, my point in the post that you quoted is that some misguided public perception first saw VAG diesels as saviors, and now again some misguided public perception sees all diesels as ""...equivalent of Victorian chimney stacks..."". In both cases, the reality was and is different than the perception.Click to expand...I never ever said that ......... and once again you are miss quoting me. For someone who ""I, for one, am not participating in the media frenzy."" you are posting rather a lot on this subject <LOL>"
"I believe the AdBlue tank capacity on the Q5 to be 23 litres. Therefore, based on my current average of around 38mpg the AdBlue would last for the following distances:@ 5% - 3,850 miles@ 2.5% - 7,700 miles@ 0.5% - 38,500 milesOn my last EU5 model I did 16,000 miles without a message to refill.Time will tell on the latest one."
"Can only go on what the manufactures say.http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/technology/diesel/adblueThe design is 5% by volume, less would mean its not as effective.http://www.ingoeoils.co.uk/adblue-explained/http://uk.air1.info/en/all-about-adblue/what-is-adblue/"
Conflicting information in those reports. 1.5 litres for 620 miles would mean a car was doing about 100mpg at 5% usage.
Hey don't get me started on false manufactures claims!
Wow its been a week without an update to this thread!! What's happening does anyone know more about SQ5 emission details yet?|
The clock is ticking.....................
"VW sales are officially down 20% from Nov 14, Audi are 4.4% down, BMW are also slightly down, whereas most other usual makers are showing good increase in sales, particularly Ford."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
great news....
I'm still waiting to receive official written confirmation from Audi HQ that my car is not affected by this fiasco but I guess that's only worth the paper it's written on!!
"And they're not giving you the paper, so it's worth less than a piece of paper itshouldbe written on."
"A colleague with an EU6 Q5 reported that his AdBlue warning appeared after 6,500 miles. My previous Q5 went for 16,000 without the warning so this appears to be good evidence for an increased flow rate."
Are there many 3.0 TDI owners still waiting for official written confirmation from Audi that their cars are not affected by the Defeat Software as I've been waiting for some weeks now and all Audi Customer Services say is that due to demand it will take a while for me to receive confirmation?
"VW customers to be compensatedVW is going to provide an ""attractive"" package for customers who have seen the value of their Volkswagen car fall due to the scandal.""We are going to prepare the right package for each market and that includes the UK,"" says Mr Mueller.Volkswagen also says it has not put aside any extra funds to cover potential litigation. But at some time there might be some extra provision, says the company's chairman."
Problem is that even if your car is not affected by this fiasco it will still suffer £ wise but VW won't come to your rescue because they will say it's market forces at work and has nothing to do with the emissions scandal. Did someone say Win Win for VW?
"I can't help but speculate that if VW's end up having poor resale value as a result of Dieselgate, then this will discourage future buyers, which works to VW's detriment. I'm still waiting to see how this settles rather than panicking or worrying. In the meantime, I'm loving my 6-month-old Q5 3.0 TDI."
Can't see how it's a win for VW. They will loose customers no matter what incentive they give and as above all the cars will devalue but they won't compensate all owners. If both my VAG cars loose value even though they are not formally affected I won't be rushing back for my next car.
"According to the online check my car is not affected.. However, if the value appears to be impacted negatively, I'll be heading back in a year or so to part exchange for the new SQ5 or SQ7 or RS4, but I will be making them an offer for their new car based on all VW group cars being affected by the scandal. Swings and roundabouts if you want to stay with the brand."
Unfortunately I think you will have a hard time convincing the dealer that his new car is worth less... and even if this was the case it will be reflected in any trade in price so I guess it nets out in the end. That's only in theory but I think in the real world it will be very different.
"I'm sure ""the new price is already adjusted for the impact"" would be my response...I've noticed parts prices have started to increase as the car values decline.. maybe this is the plan to pay for it.."
Maybe this should be highlighted in the press etc to stop them doing it?
"Car was in at the dealers today for emissions light, i was told based on my VIN our SQ5 is not impacted by this fraud.Shame, i was hoping for the cash to offset the plummeting resale values.What VW don't seem to want to hear is this is impacting ALL Audi cars, it doesn't matter if they are fitted or not with the software.So the kick in the nuts is if you have been cheated, you get some cash to reimburse your loses, if you dont have the software... well enjoy the VW size 9s in your crotch."
"""SQ5 resale values are plummeting"". Do you have evidence to support that opinion?Yesterday, I was offered £35,500 for my old banger."
"I looked on Autotrader earlier, over 90 SQ5s, cheapest was just shy of £33K, a 13 plate with 44000 on the clock. Most are still over £40k.Strangely enough not one private seller so I'm guessing most folks must still be 'reasonably' happy with trade in values."
It was on the news last night that all second hand car prices are dropping and stressed it was good for buyers.
oh well ......... must be right then. All we need now is a report in the Daily Mail to prove it <LOL>
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
I did tell you my trade in valueI already told you my trade in valuation
I take it you havnt traded yet.
"I spotted a rather nice RSQ3 and the salesman offered me a valuation for my car. No doubt, I could have pressed him for a little more.Point I was trying to make is; What evidence do you guys have (other than press hysteria) that Audi SQ5 resale values are ""plummeting""?"
How much was the RSQ3 with extras you would want.?
Why?
Curiosity.
Got letter today from AUDI saying wot the update to the cars are . The 2.0tdi is just a softwear update and the 1.6 tdi is new parts and update . A bit late for me as picked up my new car to day
"Actual trade-in price is down £1480 in just under 6 weeks.I don't care what the forecourt prices are, they have stayed level-ish, the issue is the discounts you get have rocketed up driving down the price hitting the trade-in values."
"North American media claims this is for European models only, and that the 3.0 liter TDI is still an unknown."
Got the same letter today for my Golf.
"I nust sold my SQ5 yesterday, 15 plate, 10k on the clock, got 41k for it, happy with that, payed cash, payed 49k new with discounts from 53"
That's a result - private sale or trade-in?
"You really are a glass half full person. The market is certainly not as strong for Audi as it was but you could say the same for many manufacturers. I don't see any evidence to support your opinion that trade in values ""plummeting down"" and discounts ""rocketing up"" for the SQ5."
"I personally don't see the problem with all this emission stuff I have a SQ5 on order and by the time I come to sell it I think all will be blown over, my daughter has a seat diesel and has had a letter from Seat saying its 30 minute softwear upgrade and that's all there is to it and they have said it will make no difference to performance or mpg so why all the fuss"
"Venowyellow it was a private deal to a trader, so selling completely private would have seen 43 i think. Stillhding strong in my eyes"
"Cheers - thanks for that - goes to prove that the £34,700 I was offered by WBAC for a '65 £51K spec was artificially low."
Depends - the dealer might have a buyer lined up and is happy to make a quick flip and modest profit..
"Trade values for all cars drop at this time of year so I wouldn't read too much into Snow Mans comments, never can understand why he has an SQ5 never mind any Audi. Also as the poster above says in 6 to 12 months this will be yesterday's news with the h Ronny lasting effects being on the VAG group finances and their ability to develop new innovative models."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
I dont think i got impacted atall with rescent news. I got what i wanted
I got an email this week from my Audi dealer offering A3 1.6 Tdi Cabrios. Small discount but the interesting thing is the GFV after 4 years which was 53% of RRP.That doesn't sound like a company expecting their residuals to go into free fall especially as this was for a diesel car. Yes it may end up worth less in which case the owner hands it back and walks away but audi aren't going to expose themselves to getting a load of cars back that aren't worth anywhere near the GFV.Goods news I reckoned and keeping the GFV helps keep the monthly payments lower on PCP.
"I am very surprised at 53% GFV after four years! That is more than I would have expected before the current ..... ""issue"". Only issue for me would be the interest charges on that deal(?)I am also considering an A3 Cabriolet for my wife. Perhaps a 2.0TDI / 1.8 TFSI?"
APR is 6.8% so it's normal enough. Deposit is 1500 then payments are 299 per month on a 4 year 10k per year. S Line A3 cab rio as well. Seemed pretty decent to me and as you say a very high GFV.
"I meant the total interest charges to borrow over 4 years, that will be high."
That's the price to pay for buying a new car on PCP!
"I would agree that is the price one pays for the deal. The beauty of PCP is one can tailor the package to suit your personal circumstances. You pay much less interest with max deposit, a shorter term and lower final payment."
"Depends, it doesn't mean one thing or the other - you can get Tiguans for £99/month (internal fleet emailed this one last week), it's more than likely a block deal to clear excess stock or keep the line running at cost.. BMW build cars just to have run around for a few weeks to become used cars."
The Tiguan deal will be mostly to do with the new model being just round the corner. Deals on these are pretty readily available.Agree that interest cost can be lessened with a larger deposit but can't see why you would want to reduce the GFV. This would increase the monthly payment and increase your risk should the cars value be less than predicted.
We all have different requirements.
"Yes normally that's the case but just say you bought a VW or Audi 6 months ago and then all of a sudden they were found to be cheats and demand for the brand fell considerably and potentially thus your value after 4 years is a lot less than expected. In that situation you may be very glad of a higher GFV.All hypothetical of course, can't see something like that ever happening lol.And yes you pay more interest but you repay less capital which will be greater than the interest. I'd rather take the sure bet in that situation."
How does it gain more interest for the finance company anyway??The loan size doesn't change does it. If the car is 30k with a 3k deposit. loan is always 27k no matter what the final value is. The higher GFV lessens the capital repayment and hence the monthly sum. All a lower GFV does is increase the monthly payment and increases the chance of positive equity at the end but you have paid for that each month.Am I missing something?
You don't seem to understand how interest is calculated on PCP. This is off topic and I suggest you read previous posts on PCP.
"I was of course referring to existing deals because as you say dealers are already factoring in the effects of higher discounting and lower residuals for new deals. Interestingly VW GFVs all took a downgrade around March this year, long before the public knew anything about the emissions scandal but perhaps around the time the story was breaking to VW in the US."
But also as posted above Audi are willing to pump a deal on A3 at 52% GFV at year 4. That doesn't show a loss of confidence although sales will be relatively low so if a few cars come back in negative equity it isn't going to kill them.
"It doesn't show ANYTHING, other than they want to push sales...In the same way i gave the VW example previously (which is clearly a loss leader even at the height of the models sales curve), first it sends a msg of confidence to consumers but it's also about clearing existing stock and trying to stop the decline in sales numbers. It's better to make a small loss than have airfields full of unsold cars."

Don't have ad-blue on my 2015 3.0TDI so still uncertain whether mine is affected.
i understand my2.0TDI EU6 MY16 will come with AdBlu which guzzles more than my current EU5 MY13 Q5.
I don't have Adblu on my 2015MY SQ5 and it's not affected according to Audi's Web sitehttps://www.audi.co.uk/owners-area/emissions/check-your-car.htmlRespectfully suggest you bang your registration number in and check?
Audi confirmed to me based on the VIN the SQ we have is not impacted (yet)...
"It carefully says: ""The vehicle with the Vehicle Identification Number you entered (*************) is not affected by the recall campaign for diesel exhaust gas EA189 (23Q4)"".I know it's not an EA189 engine (as I have a 3.0). However, what about other disclosures about the 3.0TDI that have since occurred. It is those I am concerned about."
"I just got my letter from Audi Canada for my 3.0 TDI with Ad-Blue. According to the very superficial wording, Audi is working with the US-based EPA and CARB authorities to devise a ""technical solution"" to address unspecified issues. The letter states that the other issues identified by authorities were the omission of documenting emission control behavior.Aside from that, Merry Christmas, folks."
"Yeah Merry Christmas, still can't decide what to do with the SQ - wish Audi would hurry up and release the Q2, the emission debacle is just boring old news now, life is too short!"
"i bought my11 2.0tdi only 6 months ago and got a recall letter about a month ago asking for it to be taken in.i purchased the car for a number of reasons inc great mpg, low emissions, and mainly because i had an a4 previously and trusted the brand. unfortunately my trust has been abused and as soon as i can put a compensation claim in iwill.ifi was a dealer and sold dodgy vehicles and i got caught out then i would expect the same.i paid more for my q5 than i have for any other car in my life so you can imagine how gutted/pissed off i was after hearing about the scandal."
From BBC News an hour agoThe US justice department is suing Volkswagen over the emissions scandal that saw the German car giant fit software in millions of cars to cheat emissions tests.
Ahh i see you have placed a new order then. Did you manage to work a good deal because of the issue?
got anextra2.7% discount (relative) as a good will gesture from the dealer because of the emissions - nothing from Audi as yet.having test driven the X3 and Land Rover discovery Sport - i could only envisage driving a Q5 again!
Well done for taking the plunge rifleman...I had a go in a disco sport - yuk! Admittedly it was the lousy old Ford engine which they have now replaced but the whole thing just felt cheap and outdated.
Anyone know the latest news on whether SQ5's are likely to be caught up in this regardless of what the VAG VIN database tells you?
"Audi have said ours is not impacted, but the rules are changing weekly, so wait and see....No compensation is to be paid to UK owners of cars that have been impacted."
"I just booked mine in for a late Feb service, and requested they do the ' emission software fix' at same time.No can do!"

"The whole thing is a meaningless pile of bureaucratic nonsense with useless tests and standards.VW were starting to get too big in the USA and probably the US car manufacturers lobbied US Gov to do something and when they found this ***** in VW's amour, they planned to go town on VW like they did on BP. Win for US car manufacturers and win ($$$) for US Gov"

"The issue was in CA were you had people doing research into global warming and pollution in general when they tried to verify the claims of cars VW stood out from the others as the on the road tests were not at all representative of what VW claimed.

This is protectionism, this is VW scamming people and they should be brought to book over it. if it means they end up having to sell off car divisions that won't be a bad thing - too many cars under one brand and they all look alike."

Has anyone had a call from Audi about the modifications that they are making to our cars ?
"I had mine in my original dealership for a service 2 weeks ago, and I requested they do the 'cheat device fix' at the same time, to save me a return visit.Told me they couldn't as they hadn't yet received the package/software/ whatever from VW to enable them to do it."
Had mine in recently and as told will soon be getting a recall. Staff had had a briefing but they were keeping tight lipped.
"I did a deal and traded it in for a new one, best fix I think !!Just hope they're telling the truth that the new 190 ps engine's are not affected........."
Interesting. I asked VAG to confirm in writing whether myMY2016 SQ5was affected and they said -in writing- that it wasn't. Should they now contact me re the 'Cheat software' many words will be exchanged!!!!
Can someone explain what the actual issue is for owners please? I get the emissions scandal is/was a nightmare for VAG but what is the issue for us??
"Sj1000 said:Depends whether your car is affected or not, if you have a 1.6l or 2.0l diesel (as in most Q5's) it probably is, depending on the year of manufacture.To put it simply, if you own one, it will be worth less than before this scandal broke, because the general public know there's a problem, but most don't know the technical details.Whether the 'fix' ( just a quick software remedy for the Q5 engine) will alleviate the public's mistrust or not, is not yet known .If you're prepared to stick with Audi brand, and trade it in for a newer, unaffected model (as I'm doing) you won't lose any value, and you can actually use the problem as a bargaining tool on the new deal.Click to expand...That's very helpful thanks. I presume mine (SQ) will be (BW13) ok then."
I bet if the fix does affect your performance they could not tell you and do the fix at the next service and you'd be none the wiser.
I think there'll be enough people/organizations monitoring the fix to see if there is any deterioration. Lawyers for one will have a vested interest.
it will be like the ppi scandal all over again. lawyers and solicitors will be sure to earn a few quid out of this crap.
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
Hope so because I would not want or have the fix if it affects performance.
"Your last sentence says ""Our engineers tell us there will be no difference in fuel consumption or driveability"" So why do it at all doesn't make sense."
"In terms of impacting performance, the question is where, and by how much....But the SQ is not impacted so it doesnt really worry me."

"Very well could be,I'm just in the process of trading my affected, yr14, 177PS, 2 yr old model, for a new (supposedly) unaffected yr16, 190PS model, with a decent discount.Who knows, if I kept the 2 yr old model, maybe in future they'd be obliged to buy back at original price and compensation, but I think that would be a long, long way down the track"
You couldn't be persuaded after all to go for the 3.0TDI then?
"No, Drove everything from the SQ5, couple of 3.0lTDI's and the newish 190ps 2.0l, and realised I was more than happy with the latter.Had chance also to buy my mates 11 month old SQ5, with only 4k on the clock, at pretty much a bargain, but with the deal I got I went for a new car again"
Just had the fix done on my Q5. Took the Option of having it done at home via AA.
Any difference noticed.
Update at first threw a few faults after but he cleared them except for Tpms which he couldnt clear till I suggested resetting it in mmi. Faults all cleared and he got a clear scan. Had to pair phone and engage autohold again.
There is no compensation planned for UK/EU.
I've had the updated done here in the UK on my 2014 Q5 as part of the service on Monday. They told me it would not affect any performance or mpg (secretly hoping I would have got a few more horses).
"I'd have thought it might decrease your horses, but if it's true about the performance and mpg, maybe not.Seems a bit genius physics if they can implement this emissions change without affectinganything!"
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"Apparently the technology has advanced in 2 years to enable them to offer this without affecting performance. Shame they didn't boost the bhp from 177 whilst they were at it then!!!!It was kind of vague as to how they do it without it affecting anything, I have a feeling the person I spoke to may not have been the most technical."
"As I understand it the software ""cheat"" was activated only during testing? Thus there should be no change to economy / performance during normal use."
Good point
I think they are cleaning up the NO2 figures too.

"But you could run the test on two different days without an ECU software change and get two separate results depending on heat soak, the weather barometric pressure..."
"I've just aquired the 2016 190 ps model, up from 177ps 2014 model.There's a slight difference I enjoy, under certain conditions, (less lag when pulling out onto busy intersection etc)a couple of bhp/ps here or there will make zero discernible difference"
"my 2010 2.0tdi q5 is due a cambelt and water pump change. ive booked it into kings lynn audi for tuesday at a fixed price of £599 and £12 for a hire car for the day,will they fix the emission recall problem whilst its in with them on the sneaky? or ask me to come im another time? thx andy"
"If I was you, I'd request that they do it at same time if they can.Save you another journey there and makes them aware that you're expecting it.I asked a few months ago for them to combine it with my service, but they said they didn't have the necessary software at the time."
I had the aircon update in January this year.

"I hope VW get handed their arse. if they go bust, so be it."
"Anyone been contacted by Audi yet?Maybe would help others if people add to the topic once you get yours with model, age and engine fitted."
"If VW goes bust, us Audi Q5 drivers are up Shitt Creek without a paddle. I wish for my Q5 to be supported for as long as I own it. And considering how much I like it, I hope I own it for a looooooong time"
Lol.... You think the german government wouldn't bail them out?Even though its illegal under EU law...!
I find it curious that only VAG are being targeted for compensation by USA regulators and none of the other manufacturer's found to be emitting more than the permitted emissions.
"Whilst not condoning VAG cheating the test, I tend to think this has been exaggerated and has the hall marks of and smells like a.n.other dirty tricks campaign."
"Audistorm said:My 2015 Q5 was serviced yesterday at Audi Tamworth, when I originally booked it in I was asked if I wanted the software update for the emissions, I asked ""do I have to have it"", answer was no, collected the car yesterday evening, 36k (now 16 months old) service clean and fresh, paperwork said healthcheck completed, 4.5mm all round on all four original tyres and two software updates so I asked what are these two addtions, I was told one was an aircon recalibration and the second the updated engine software.My car is the 150bhp so obviously I dont want to lose any horses, I was told sir this new software has been completed on over 100 vehicles since June with no issues, and the caveat ! and you may even notice a slight rise in power. As we all know the likelihood is that this will not be the case, my car is a Euro 5 pre Adblue, just EGR and a DPF version. I think the aircon ""update"" maybe a coincidence, my aircon was perfect before, I worry and I am suspicious that this calibration change is linked to the aircon compressors drain on the engine, hence linked to the emissions software update, I heard at least 3 other discussions yesterday whilst I was waiting around for mine of the same aircon re calibration carried out to various Audis. Cant help feeling suspicious. Could just be a coincidence.Drove home approx 20 miles, doesnt seem to be any different, got some family trips at the weekend with a full car so will be able to see, did need to set a few things up again as experienced by some others, coming home lights and handbrake.Only time will tell if there is any difference good or bad, so far it doesnt seem to be any more powerful, will keep you posted. I would prefer to leave as is so please be firm if your choice is no otherwise like me it will just get updated.Click to expand...I would be livid if they did the update against my wishes - I certainly would not be paying for the service! Mine is going in next week and I'm going to be very clear that they will be doing a free service if it's apparent that they have performed the update."
"Well, if you're so against the update, threatening them with a non-paid £300 service doesn't seem very convincing, or livid, does it?Either tell them to not do it, on threat of prosecution/suing whatever, or just roll over and accept it.Just my opinion of course."
"i have to be honest that whilst i was not very happy i havent seen any negative behavior, doesnt seem to be any different and my bargaining power over not paying is weak as it is a lease car.fuel consumption via the dis seems to hover between 36 and 50mpg depending on driving style, i dont think its that far off as the tank to tank seems ok too."
So noticed that the oil was down a bit on the digital readout so topped it up. But it now shows it's full but either I topped it up exactly or overfilled it.
"It is bad to overfill. Where was the level on the gauge and how much did you put in?I would suggest you wait a little longer next time. When car tells you to top up, it takes the litre which should be in your boot."
Probably around a quarter left in. I put in just over half a litre.
Sounds as though you have filled it up just right if half a litre took it from a quarter all the way up to full. I always use the manual dipstick (T40178) as well just to check that the DIS is suitably calibrated.
That would be about right. 1 litre equates from low oil warning i.e. near minimum to near maximum on the level display.
"I did same - put in half of the litre container when it was below 1/4 on the dis.I'm not sure that it's using oil, or that that is where it was from new, but I'm used to my Boxster that always shows full, and has never used a drop in >11 years"
"There's quite a few companies offer tailored and personalised floor mats.The standard mats are OK but with no heel plate they'll wear out quickly, been thinking of getting a set from Autostyle with SQ5 logo, they offer different heel plates including metal."
I tried the web site but it doe s not allow selection of heel plate (iPad) I've emailed them but no response yetThanks
"Autostyle looks to be good. I viewed web site on iPad, but this does not show all their options, seems they will do metal heel plate and logos, on edge or at the base for a reasonable price."
Ordered some from auto style with bespoke SQ;5 V6T logoWe will see what they look like when I'm back in uk next week
"I've found that by the time my driver's side mat is showing wear at the heel of my accelerator position, then the rest of the mat is also looking like it could do with a refresh, so a replacement makes sense (not just for the heel wear). Too bad that I can't replace a single driver's side front mat, because they're only sold as a set of 4."
"Try auto style, they have heeled mats and maybe just driver side only. I was after four to ensure originals remain as new for when I pass the car on. Always looks better with new mats"
Interested in getting a set so would appreciate a snap when you get a chance
Eta Friday ....
"Good quality, fits well and they created logos from images off the car.If I had one negative it is the heel plate is too far forward as shoe heel rests in rear most line of holes.Could come further rearward by half the depth of the heel plate.

"Thought about rotating the text on the fronts, but SQ5 is on the sills, so thought it would be too cluttered and repetitive.Can't see the point of heel rest for passenger side though.I like the V6T, but it's all personal preference. ????????"
"Look good, see what you mean about the heel plate though."

"Maybe you need the official Carista OBD module? I take it you did the in-app purchase to make it pro as well?

Why did you buy the Carista OBD2 module if you can access it already?Can't help you with the mirror mod as mine already does this by default.Think I will also add the emergency hazard lights. Do you know how hard braking or fast you need to be get them to activate?
Bought the official module as some say that the cheaper ELM modules only do some of the coding so at £25 thought it worth buying.Not sure how hard you would need to brake to flash the hazard lights but I would say only way to test is do an emergency s top and see iff hazard lights flash on dash.21
"My factory fitted (enabled) one only returns to memory once you move forward over a certain speed - no need select middle position again. I think that is ""normal""."

"Just called Hatfield Audi to book my car in as the indicator on the dash came on to tell me that I need an interim service.The car is 11 months old and has 9000 miles.Firstly I got redirected to a call centre who told me that I could not use my own oil due to health and safety (!!)So, I called the dealer direct and managed to get through to a very helpful guy in service called Mike. He said no problem using my own oil, and the bill would decrease by approx £100 for the 7 litres of oil (the call centre inc-oil-quote was £267.88)However, when he'd taken all the details, he told me that I don't need a service at all. That the indicator on the dash was incorrectly set to 'short service' when it should be 'long service'. He said that a lot of cars are incorrectly set from the factory. The first oil/inspection should be at 2 years or 19,000 miles (whichever comes first)"
"Only part of the story.If you do mostly short journeys, Audi recommend oil change at yearly intervals."
Strange . He was adamant. I do 200 miles every weekend on motorways and A/B roads and then local journeys all weekSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
"Still a bit confused about all this. I phoned another dealer to check and they basically said it's up to me...Either I can have the oil service now at 1 year old and thence forth every other year (year 1, 3, 5, 7....)Or I can align it with the inspection service at 2, 4, 6, 8....This is assuming I keep to 9500 miles per yearSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Audi advise annual oil change if one does mainly short journeys. Some owners feel 2 years between oil change risks premature engine wear.This subject has been debated before. I would suggest you search for fuller discussion on the pros and cons of long life servicing.
500 miles of journeys next week alone so I'll stick to the 19k miles I think. I'll put the oil I bought on the shelf in the garage until next yearSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
My Q5 cone up with a service due notification 11 months in at around during 7000miles. I was told my audi Watford that the mmi is incorrectly programed at factory and that the service should be done every 2 years or 19000 miles whichever comes sooner. But the telephone booking call centre are a bunch of money grabbing incompetent tossers who have no knowledge what so ever. I was bit dubious about their strange knowledge so I went direct to the dealer. I was told for any future queries to bypass the call centre as they get a lot of dissatisfied customers complaining. Top service by audi Watford everytine. My experience has been they not like other dealers looking good to rob you blind (mercedes)
Is there any way to check that the mileage of my car is genuine and has not been clocked back?
VCDS will let you read the mileage from the ECU (which should be the same as the instrument panel (although in KM rather than Miles).

"morningdriving to the French Alps at Easter 2016. so the last week in March, first week in AprilVery very unlikely that i'll need to use snow chains. But i'll be on normal (summer) tyres, and the rules say i need to have chains with me just in case of a dump of snow and a gendarme telling me i can't go further without chains.so has anyone found anywhere that sells chains to fit my wheels? 255/40/R21 is the tyre size. so far i can't find anywhere selling chains to fiti suppose snow socks would be a valid alternative, but i can't find any of them either.....thanks in advance"
you might already have some now but i have the 21s on mine and i have got a set of chains for mine and they are spot on. don't touch wheels and clear suspension.they are maggi TRAK.bit pricey but good set.they fit by clamping to the wheel nuts so you just have to pop the centre cap off and your away.

"Had to rescue a pals broken down vehicle yesterday - short 2 mile tow to get it back home but a conundrum arose:I have a factory fitted retractable tow bar fitted to the SQ5+ so my initial thoughts were to use a towing rope between that and a towing eye point on the front of his vehicle.Is there a preferred / recommended approach for this? In other words, should I have used tow rope from the eye on my vehicle (rather than use the tow bar) to towing eye on his, or is using the tow bar considered better / safer?"
"Hate to say it, but the User Manual does specifically state only use the towing eyes ......................."
Cheers Mr H - lucky perhaps it was a level 2 mile tow of a very small car rather than an uphill drag of anything bigger or heavier.Hate to think what the consequences could have been!Good to know for the future though. Thanks again.
I would have thought the rear towing eye would be used to pull you out a ditch or something like that . there would be no way I would tow someone else with it if you had a towbar
"I called my Audi dealer and asked for the price of a 28,000 mile oil service and they quoted me £280 which I told them was ridiculous given that the parts are oil and filter, screen wash only. After much discussion we settled on £240. I was still not happy but as this was my supplying dealer, I wanted to keep the relationship. When I went to collect the car, the bill was £208. I quietly paid for the service.So what happened for the price to be reduced further?"
"Had a similar experience with my last service, amount charged when I went to collect it was quite a bit less than the price I had got them down to on the phone when I booked it in.Does not excuse the fact that the sump was not filled but after a bit of e-mail and phone chat the service manager posted out a litre of Castrol Edge."
"So I've been reading up on the 100kg weight loss of the new Q5's this year.Anyone know if this is fact and if it actually contributes towards a huge difference in power, relative to the 3.0 models released in the last few years?Wondering if it's much of a muchness or whether it's something worth considering this year."
"It's the difference between driving solo or with one beefy passenger (I'm 95kgs), suspect no-one, except BTCC drivers, will notice."
"Ha! Yeah I'm pretty sure I fall into that category too SteveMcB!I'd like to think the new lighter construction metals would prove to give a noticeable difference to the ride but I guess at the very least, fuel consumption will benefit in some way."
"I've got my Q5 on a flexible service regime and it's coming up to it's first service at approx 18k miles. Audi confusingly differentiate between an Oil Change Service (fixed), Oil Change Service (flexible) and Inspection, but their advertised services are Interim Service and Major Service. I'm assuming that I'm after an Interim Service which includes an Oil Change Service with longlife oil? Can anyone please enlighten me and offer any sample costs.Cheers"
The MMI on my SQ5 informed me I needed a oil change (not an interim service) recently. After shopping around (the prices vary substantially between Audi dealers) my local dealer price matched a dealer from within their same group at £229 for an oil and filter change. Most of this is made up of the labour charge at rates that would make a lawyer embarrassed!
"If its first service at 18k, you need the oil/filter change and inspection.I had it done in March, plus they changed pollen filter (?) and it came to around £325inc.VAT.It's just like combining the 9,000 & 18,000 mile service/inspection/whatever they want to label it, and works out a bit cheaper combining them (apparently).Anyway, it took me two years to get there, so the price seemed pretty reasonable to me, to have it done at my original Audi dealership.If the price goes much above what I quoted, you want to be asking why"
Cheers Folks
Interesting. I was just quoted £427 which made me gulp and query that thiswasfor a combined service (i.e.flex oil change service with an Inspection service) to which it was confirmed. When I said I was expecting around £325 for a combined she went away and said for Q5's from Jan2015 service costs were increased(mine was 1st reg Jan 2015 but arrived at the garage mid-december). She went on to say 'but I can put yours through as a Dec 14 and we can do it for £340..... Not surprisingly I agreed.. What a muddle it all is...Thanks SJ1000 - your indicative price really helped me here.

"OK, summer's not over just yet, but I'm already thinking of winter tyres for regular jaunts to the ski slopes.I've previously used the factory-supplied 21"" wheels and tyres during summer months, swapping to a separate set of 20"" rims shod with Pirelli Snow and Ice winter tyres for the colder season.(I originally went this route as I couldn't find anyone manufacturing a 21"" winter tyre).Question - a couple of years since I last looked so does anyone now make a 21"" winter tyre and if so, any pointers on where to purchase here in the UK?Cheers."
"@Barbyboy I'm pretty sure that you can get 21s winter tyres as I've seen a set adverised used....however, I personally would stick with a separate set of 20s as I can't imagine that swapping the tyres 'often' is too good for them.Also, I can switch my wheels myself, but would need a local garage and £60+ each time I want a tyre place to change themDid you not keep your old 20s?PS: not too early to think about these things - I bought chains 2 weeks ago"

I thought I would ask what colour people have chosen for their Q5. I have not yet decided but will have to on the 31 May 2013 when I hopw to buy.
"I saw the vote for Teak Brown so Googled pictures and I like the colour, looks really smart, I had an X5 in a metallic beige with pale pastel green leather (sounds yuk but looked so smart in real life and so many people loved it) I cant remember BMW's name for it but it was more exotic than Teak Brown! Come on Audi surely such an unusual colour deserves a better name than Teak?"
Thanks for all your inputs. I have to say that we are stuck between scuba blue or lava grey. Two very different colours. Does anyone who has these colours have any regrets on their choice.Thanks
"I just love the plain old ibis white, did have monsoon grey on one that was'nt down to me it was ex demo it was ok'ish."
"I have Scuba Blue and it is amazing everyone who sees it thinks it looks just right on the car, the only one I have seen in this colour so to me it isUnique, of course each person has their one favorite it depends if you want to go with the safe bet or chose your own"
"We have finally deceided to go for cuvee silver, after having seen one at an Audi dealership. According to Audi HQ only 24 have been registered so far, so the colur will be quite rare."
Nice choice. I wanted to go for cuvee silver also but as it will be the wife's car she chose Ice silver.
Glacier White. wont show scratches as bad as some others but bad for showing tar spots.
Missile I take it you didn't participate in this poll?
I am one of the 24 then. Cuvee is classic and classy and I still haven't seen another one on the road. Nice you could get the stats from Audi!
I chose the volcano red ..It is stunning and I get compliments everywhere I go.. I have always had white black and silver vehicles so was really steeping out of the box on this one..I love it!!!!!!!
"Having seen a couple of Mayo browns in showrooms, I am not surprised, no one has gone for it. Its a bit of an acquired taste."
"As i have heard in past this Estoril Blue colour is a very sort paint or soft skin, just came back from hols and had a couple of Bird shits on bonnet which i removed within hours of seeing them, looking at it closer now home and washed properly ive noticed it has marked the lacquer and paint a lot,it has really bitten in to it,off to Audi tomorrow where the guys will hopefully machine polish it outWorth keeping an eye or - or it just could be a case of Coastal Sea Gulls have ACID shits, Too Many Fish & Chips !!"
Me too fella. I have gone for the Volcano red with the titanium wheels and black pack. Looks mean!! lol
I just wanted to keep this post alive. Any chance of having it pinned. The question of colour seems to be a popular one.
I just saw a customised vote. How about a photograph please.
anyone looking for real life colours check out this link..helped me push towards lava grey for sure!http://www.autogespot.co.uk/audi/sq5-tdi-b8/spots?spottype=photo
Maya Brown. It was the only ready available and it looked nice!
Estoril Blue for me.....looks beautiful (in the showroom). I have seen a few reviews and comments that it is beautiful in the sun but very 'ordinary' in other light.

About right...
Phantom Black because I went for the black styling pack and titanium alloys - think I could have tried to contrast with white but wanted the full effect of the black...
"Estoril, Would have gone white as i feel its the best option but have that on the existing one.Daytona is not available on the SQ, so that was out. So Estoril it was by virtual of nothing else jumps out.Real poor colour palette, black was a MASSIVE no - got it on a current car and its the worse thing ive ever done (and i've done some bad things!)"
"I went for Daytona, by process of elimination. I quickly crossed out the black colours (high maintenance), the red is orange, I've had loads of silver cars, didn't fancy brown or blue, so it was a choice of white or several shades of grey. My wife's car is white, so we decided on grey....and Daytona seemed to be best...Interesting to note it is the most popular colour in this survey - by quite a distance."
would have loved to have the sq5 in daytona but its not available unless you go exclusive (no thanks) so lava grey it was Pictures to follow next week!the matt grey option at bentley would have been the ultimate colourhttp://www.cheltenham.bentleymotors.com/Pre-Owned-Models/search/Bentley_Continental_Supersports_5108224/whlst looking for the colour I came across thishttp://www.bentleymotors.com/models/bentley_suv/might have to be my 2016 car!!
"Ordered Lava Grey as I wanted a dark colour but not black, I thought the grey was very classy and would be a nice contrast again the black pack and privacy glass. It might even stay cleaner for longer opposed to black as well."
Good choice Leezo!
Daytona Gray on order. Chosen because it was the same color as the RS4 I couldn't have...
"Current Q5 is Daytona Grey (and love it), but have chosen Lava Grey for the SQ5 on order.Originally went for Estoril Blue and, whilst a beautiful colour in full sunlight, felt that it looked a bit flat in dull light (IMVHO, so apologies to all Estoril owners!)"
"Misano Red, exclusive colour. Because I like RED"
"Daytona Grey, I like the colour on the car, not too bright or dark, I have Scuba blue on the A3, nice colour on the car."
"Don't know how I actually vote here, but I chose Ice Silver because it doesn't show the road muck very clearly!"
Glacier White for me as I had Dolphin Grey on my A3 so didn't want to go down the grey route again. I Haven't regretted it once and I'm amazed at how clean it stays... I am definitely cleaning it less than I did with Dolphin Grey as it doesn't show up the pollen dust.Will go for white again next time too I'm sure!I expect it will be a different story in the winter though ;-)Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"Shenstone, it should be obvious with round circles next to the colours and a vote button, unless you have already voted, in which case you should be able to delete your vote by pressing the button stating that."

Ibis White vs. Monsoon Gray vs. Ice Silver? Thoughts for Q5??
"I've got black ,but realy wanted Daytona grey,but that colour is not available on sq5,the reason I wanted is there's not a lot around,easier to look clean,and looks gr8 with dark wheels,and dark tints"
"Colour is a funny thing! When I chose my colour, Monsson grey was last on my list having seen it at a dealer. But then last week I saw another one and it looked really great!Daytona is nice but very common accross all Audi cars. I personally prefer glacier whire but veleive that white will not look good in a few years time. So if only for 3 years you will be ok."

"Very similar reasoning to my self, had silver for the last 3 cars and the daytona grey is my way of moving away."
"The Q5 is my better halfs' car... she chose white after having the phantom black A3 for 6 years.I would have choosen Monsoon Grey.I noticed that you don't have Artic Silver as a choice, It is a choice in Australia."
"I chose Cuvee Silver because1. Its the nicest light colour there is (in my opinion), my second choice is the Glacier White.2. I already own a silver car3. Dings and scratches wont show up easily on lighter colours compared to darker colours"
I picked moonlight blue because I live In Essex and every other new car is either white or black.
Lava Grey gives it a serious car look not just a fashion accessory.....
Good to hear actualy GRANDDUC as i spec'd Lava Grey and now just counting down days till delivery...

Racing Mica Blue for our SQ5... Still waiting on build date to get confirmed for week 48Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Went with Daytona as I have Quartz just now on an A5 which I love but I wan't a bit of a change. White was an aption but I don't have the time to keep it as clean as it should and the other half has a black SLK so wanted abit of a colour mix - 50 shades of........
"We went with Midnight Blue. The Q5 replaces our black 4Runner and we wanted something different. Any gray/silver was out because my other car in the garage (Porsche) is Meteor Gray, and didn't want anything too similar. I don't mind the white, but everyone here seems to have a white Audi. So far, I really like the dark blue although, with the weather we've been having it's been impossible to keep it even slightly clean for more than 300 ft from the car wash."
"QShip, did you man moonlight blue? If midnight blue is available in Canada,I can add this to the poll."
"Sprint blue pearl effect, find most standard Audi colours a bit grey/dull, had a couple of dark blue and black cars but I like to keep my car clean and dark colours only look good polished. White looks nice also."

"I thought that, but when I looked it up there was no mention of them... Maybe it was optional for the lucky/foolish that bought them?"
Haha must be!
Monsoon Gray because that's what I could get in a barely used vehicle. Tried to avoid black because too hard to keep clean. I think the gray looks quite sharp!
Daytona Grey again - because I like it! Can I vote twice?
Ransman. Sorry but i think only once is allowed per login member. Did you go for a second Q5 in the same colour?
I went for Teak Brown after seeing it on a trip to Germany lovely metallic pop when the sun is shining andnot too bad for showing the dirt.
"phantom blacklooks mean and aggresive, estoril blue second choice."
"Quick question folks... what's the difference between Phantom Black and Panther Black... I've seen Brilliant black and Phantom,not Panther(is this only available on SQ5?)Cheers"
Panther is crystal effect - it has a lot of purple flick in it. Exclusive to the SQ5 as you say. My favourite Audi colour (but the Mrs wanted white!).
"Jose, it must be love....which is why we blokes can't understand it."
Love it is! We just met our wedding coordinator this evening actually - only 47 days to go!!
Another tick for the Lava Grey...
"I went for Phantom Black because it contrasts well with the metals eg. alloys, roof rails, window sills etc. Also black makes the car look bigger"
Phantom black- for me the best choice with privacy and contrast to the rear light clusters and chrome detailing... Also comes up spectacular after a full polish and wax treatment in the summer months... No denying it's harder the keep clean though

"Panther Black for me, bit of a sucker for black cars plus it was available within a week"
grey is the new black
Had a 2.0 Tdi in Daytona Grey but wanted a complete contrast for the forthcoming SQ5 so have gone for Glacier White. Choice of colours for the SQ5 is poor.
"Mrs Blue has gone for Monsoon with privacy, no badges and 21 inch wheels. I would've preferred Panther, but I know who will end up washing it most of the time so was quite happy to see her opt for grey."

SQ5 in ibis white for usMy choice would have been black with red/black leather but wife wanted whiteI got to choose the rest of spec
I choose ibis white as I did not like the glazier white in different light settings.I also do not like dark colour's and have had silver for a few years and though white a nice change.Also and the main reason it's what the wife picked
"I'm maybe regretting Daytona, it's as if every (flying) bird in the vicinity of my office carpark wants to cr*p all over it. Black cars, white cars etc all seem to be left alone. Doesn't matter that I'm nowhere near a lamp post or tree for them to sit and cr*p on my car, they just fly over and drop it directly on me, especially gulls. Maybe I'm getting paranoid!"
"I know what you mean, the silver mercedes never gets touched, the Q everyday it seems.Went to rinse some off this evening and a dam sparrow swooped by and.. plop."
"Waxed my Ibis White SQ5 at the weekend, didn't particularly need it as it had lifeshine applied when new 2 months ago but the surface wasn't as smooth as it should be. A quick coat of Raceglaze 55 and in the sun it looks amazing, so reflective and gleaming."
"Ibis White looks great in the Aussie sunshine, plus easy to touch up all those little stonechips and supermarket trolley scratches."
"I still like white, next car will be white again. Really works on the Q5.(with the exception of the bluewhite ford seem to have - looks strange)."

I get my Scuba Blue Q5 on Sunday. I picked the colour becuase me and the wife like Blue cars and Moonlight blue was too grey for my liking.
"I picked Glacier white because I wanted a colour that hides paint defects a bit better than black or my case red cars. Nothing worse than a nice sunny day and all you can see is swirl marks,so I hope white will be a bit better."
Ditto
White really works on the Q5

"I now have satin mat grey,reason is I wanted an individual colour !"
I went for Sepang Blue but was torn between that and black. Eventually decided the blue was a little less obvious and really stood out on the one and only actual SQ5 I've seen in that colour. The contrasting against the wing mirrors was really something. I also feel that the bigger wheels that I wanted only suit certain cars. The standard wheels look better to me on dark colours and teh bigger wheels on bright colours. Good job we don't all see the same things in our cars though!
I ordered my 2015 Q5 Prestige in Glacier White with the Titanium Silver interior with the Satellite Aluminum inlays. Im anxious for it to arrive.... They said it would be here by Thanksgiving... not sure I believe it though.

I got the Daytona Grey. Was advised by the audi salesman that it's an unique pearlessent paint available only for s line plus models. Apparently it also helps with resale / trade in values.

How very dare they choose the same colour as moi.....Never had this feeling with the silver 520D tourer, which is just as well. I'd have been having little hissy fits all day.Maya brown looks lovely when it's spotlessly clean. This time of the year in Cumbria that's the first mile after a wash."
"Sepang Blue SQ5....I was tempted by black again and going fully black with wheels and all badging etc (current dealer SQ5 demo has been done) .... but then I saw the sepang blue in the 'flesh' and fell in love... with the black pack to reomove all the old school chrome, she stands our even more than I expected and she turns more heads than my previous cars..Perfect colour for me."
"Sounds crisp,get a pic up ????"
First choice was Volcano Red but they stopped making that color for '16.Second choice was Cuvee Silver and have that on order.
i've got a Sepang Blue SQ5 coming shortly. Kept the Chrome too.....
Got a Lava Grey SQ5 coming in July
Volcano Red is still shown in the Apr 15 brochure and today's confabulator????
Not available in the US on a MY16. Not sure why but it has been confirmed by several dealers and is not listed in the 2016 Order Guide. Also eliminated for '16 were Teak and Maya.
Excellent choice txtom. It will never look outdated and very easy to keep clean.
"I really like the Lava grey colour, but didn't like the pearlescent effect and wish Audi did a metallic only version. Ended up changing from Brilliant Black to Lava Grey and finally to Mythos Black as I had seen a one with the black styling back and couldn't stop thinking about it. This combination to me looks awesome!"
"Was down to either Ibis or Sepang, and just felt the Sepang looked pretty amazing (when clean anyway). Will be interesting to see how I feel after a few months/years of ownership as I wouldn't normally go for a blue, but looking around the roads these days there seems to be masses of black and white and silver cars wherever you look. Fingers crossed it always feels special."

Picked Panther Black as changes colour in different lights and -I think- suits the SQ5.
"Sepang SQ5 due next week. The reason is because my current A5 is daytona grey and my missus runs a silver A5. I thought the sepang looked stunning in the showroom and have always loved the SQ5 in black. Owned black before, looks lovely when clean but doesn't stay clean for long."
I've also just ordered Volcano red as Mr advised that my last 3 cars have been white! I like white....
"I chose Mythos Black because I like black, simple really. I also chose the black pack because I think it looks awesome and I'm not too keen on a lot of chrome."
Glacier white with black styling pack for my new order
I went for Sepang Blue as last two cars where black and the greys just blend in. Added the black pack to give it an edge over the chrome.
I just got mine the other day. It's Misano Red with black trim. I love it.
Get a pic up ????
"Evening all, finally fixed on Lava Grey for my SQ5 order - used many references and opinions on this site to help decide as not seen one in this colour although did see a v nice A4 at the dealer last weekend. Phoned my dealer and changed my Panther black order to Lava on Monday morning! Sticking with the chrome in the end rather than the black pack."
Good switch Norbs. Lava grey better than black and chrome always looks classy.
Sepang Blue - picking it up on Friday 11th September - only three days to go
New SQ5 - Panther Black for me.
"Looking at the poll results, where are all the Daytona greys? I only ever see Black/white/dark blue/silver."
"I was a bit worried about going for Volcano Red as ad never seen one. But, it looks gorgeous, I'm so pleased with it. Especially with the multi spoke wheels and chrome trim it really looks a class job! (Like me of course...)"
I would prob have gone for Daytona if it had been available on the SQ5 now. Happy with Lava order and looking forward to receiving it in next couple of weeks!
"My fav colours are:DaytonaLava GreyBlackBut I also really like the red (test drove a red SQ5), white with black styling pack looks smart too!"
"Utopia blue........why , don't know, just suited the beast well. I thought it was an unusual colour until I looked around, still like it."
"keithian,You have not voted yet. Nothing recorded for utopian blue. nice colour though"
"Scuba Blue. I resonate with blue hues and other jewel tones. I don't know why. I passed over Utopia Blue Metallic because I felt it was too grey for me, and I skipped over Moonlight Blue Metallic because it looked too Royal Blue for me.To my eyes, Scuba Blue is brilliant in bright light without being garish. In subdued light, it looks like Royal Blue. I just love the look."

i chose Floret Silver for my new Q5 -1. it had to look noticeably different to my current Lava Grey Q52. it will contrast the Extended Black Styling Pack very well3. i couldn't bring myself to owning a blue car even though i think Sepang Blue is a lovely colour
"Sepang, first ever blue car, saw one in the showroom and was converted, although if daytona had been an option I would probably have gone for that.Usual colours have been silver, grey, black, fancied a change and didn't want 3 silver cars in the drive!"
"Panther black ordered, same colour as the RS4 it is going to replace. It also saves me having to replace the unused touch up I already have!!!!"
"Daytona Grey - its easier to keep clean than white, black, silver and there was not a lot of Daytona around when I got my Q5"
"Daytona Grey currently on order, my previous 2 cars were White fancied a change this time round."
Well. I was taken by Utopia Blue in a shopping centre. Love that colour.
Congratulations. The first Utopia blue. Make sure you post a picture. Thanks
"I must admit, Utopia did look really lovely, so hope you enjoy it.I am yet to see another Volcano Red one like mine despite miles of driving around - anyone here got one apart from me? (BTW, I totally love it, very dignified and different after having had a white one)"
<-- yes
+1 On the SQ5 Plus it's got Black detailing everywhere and with Red calipers it's most elegent and well balanced colour combo for me.
Went for LavaI do site visits at high net worth properties and wanted something that wasn't in your face. Also love Carbon Grey on the Golf and thought this was similar
I thought Sepang would have been more popular or are the results for Sepang low in the poll due to being unable to order it on some cars
I've got a Garnet Red.Wanted a colour that you very rarely see on the roads in and around East London!
Ordered Lava Grey from standard list but if it does not match up I may opt for this as an alternativeAbout 4mins 14secs in

"Mythos Black, because my wife loves black cars. Pistachio interior, because my wife is also crazy!"
Phantom Black. Black interior. Cos the wife said so.
Daytona Grey obviously. I have an Ibis White A3 (just 'gifted' it to the missus actually) so we wanted a different colour to that. The Grey is just a nice classy colour which will be complimented by the extended black styling pack....
Nardo grey now ????
"Hi,As some of you may have read, I'm getting a new Q5 S-Line Plus on September 1st - so it'll be a 66-plate. I'm thinking of putting a 'personalised' plate on it but it needs to retain the 66 configuration eg. **66 ***I could do with some ideas that may be Audi or Q5 related. Can't do anything referring to my name which is Ian as you can't have the letter 'I'. Neither can you have a 'Q'. On my other car which I've sold to the missus I did AU61 *** which read (if you were drunk or stupid) 'AUDI' *** - and kept the 61 year prefix which the car is. This doesn't work with a 66 plate tho!!Apologies to those that think it's a naff idea!!Any topics, thoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated.Cheers....."
ID66IOT(With some substitute for the non allowed 'I's)
Hardly an idiot if I'm driving a £40k car.So.....any sensible suggestions?
P166 0FF1D6610TP16 61TED166ERSE66 HEADE66 FARTROUTE66BE66END
"What is meant by ""66 plate""? I live in Ontario, Canada, so I'm unfamiliar with those terms."
Sorry my simple request has caused so much offence.Can someone delete this thread please?
But thanks SteveMcB - some sensible ideas there.(I'm just after something I can put on the car that will be different to the random letters that the dealer will try and allocate.)
"BO66 OFF - bogg offGA6 6OOD - comedian?MA66STY - king?GY66LES -gigglesGO66LES - swimmer?BOGGLES - the mind....I have a plate that the PO put on the car. It's 'only' a <letter><number><letter><letter><letter> but, actually, I think it hides that the car is less than a year old and that's weirdly a possitive thing."
"Our ""standard"" registration plates have a year identifier so, for example, a car first registered from 1 Mar 16 will be in the format ""XX16 XXX"" and from 1 Sep 16 it will be ""XX66 XXX""......................"
"I assume you meant ""1 September 1966will be XX66 XXX"". If so, then that makes sense to me. Thanks"
"UK registrations have new identifiers every six months issued in March and September. To differentiate between the 2 issues for a given year the earlier issues (March) are identified by the year e.g. XX16 XXX and the latter issue for cars registered between 1st September 2016 and Feb 28 2017 are the year plus 50. Hence the next issue from 1st Sept 2016 will be XX66 XXX.Yes, just to add confusion a car bought after 1 Jan 17 will still be issued with a 66 identifier!"
I'm looking forward to my randomly generated number plate by the DVLA computer. As the general consensus is that it's stupid to do anything otherwise.....
On long motorway journeys I have sometimes kept myself amused by counting the personal registrations (sad I know!). I reckon about 15% of car owners have taken the plunge.
"Hi,As some of you may have read, I'm getting a new Q5 S-Line Plus on September 1st - so it'll be a 66-plate.

Now that's a lot of counting. Does that mean 85% couldn't care less what reg number they have......
Anything on the DVLA list is a minimum £399 with a 66 configuration. So they are effectively forcing you to pay more to allow you to keep the 66 identity. And anything remotely interesting with a name automatically jumps to £799. It's as if they are assuming if you can afford a new car you can afford to pay more for a plate.And anything remotely interesting has been reserved for special auction.Even Dick Turpin was more compassionate to his victims.
"Basically supply and demand isn't it.They'll charge whatever people are prepared to pay..£799 is tip of the ice-berg, don't know about DVLA's top limits are, but personal no.plates is big business privately and soon get into the £1000's and tens of 1000's...probably more for any two letters with 1 after them"
Saved changing three car passes by keeping the same reg
Geez - we really are peasants on here. And I'm scoffing over £799...... I think I'm just going to have to bend over and let Mr DVLA have his way.....
I bought a cheapo '55' one from DVLA in 2005 and have used it on 4 cars since. Although I've become attached to it now I do however agree with the post mentioning it'd be better spent on options or something far more useful!
"Hi AllNot had my SQ5 long and learning things about it all the time. Got a little confused this morning when I got in, I always leave the pano roof blind open but when I got in this morning it just started shutting on it's own I didn't press any buttons.Any thoughts on this??"
"I think if you somehow hold the Lock button down on the remote for long enough it will shut the roof and close the blind, maybe the remote was squeezed up in your pocket?"
"Cheers, I must have just had something pressing against it in my pocket I suppose it's the keyless one."
"Yea I found this the other day, as previously said when you close the sunroof by using the key fob it brings the blind partially along with it annoyingly."
agree with this comment:Lock button down on the remote for long enough it will shut the roof and close the blind..< advertising deleted >
"I have had my SQ5 PLUS since March 1st and I have noticed whilst washing it that there are loads of imperfections in the both the paint work and some of the tinted windows, It almost looks like blobs of silicone in the paint when it has been painted when the car is clean you can see it really quite bad.What would you recommend I do, can I take it back to any Audi dealer or does it need to go back to the dealer that sold it me as that is a lot further than my local dealerAll advise appreciated"
"Try and pick up the defect with camera. If your not happy take it back, although 3 months is quite a long time before you noticed."
"Yes that is my worry too be honest, BUT it is still only 3 months and 2500 miles old and should not be like it on a 50k car, the rear screen looks like its been done by a cowboy tinting company and is full of air bubblesShould I return it to the dealer I purchased it from ?????"
Yes take it back at your earliest convenience and tell them you are not happy and why.
"Take it to a professional detailer, ask their opinion on the cause.Then take it back to the dealer fully armed with the correct knowledge and cause.....That way they'll not be able to fob you off with any lousy excuses. In my experience dealers don't really understand the painting process.Steve"
"Good call steve I did as you said and it is something that has landed on my car but they are not sure what it is but is is NOT a defect in the paint which is great news even though it looks like its in the paint and not on top of it, they managed to remove some of the marks with some clay putty stuff so I have booked car in with them to do it all over then protect the whole car with a wax so should all be good by next weekThanks for your advise"
"That's good news, a good detailer will sort it out."
Good result. That'd would be a Huge weight off my mind.Steve
"Still thinking about doing this myself. Can anyone recommend me a brand/spec of high temp spray paint that will work? Which will preferably not peel, crack or make a mess in a couple of months?I'm also tempted to spray the exhaust boxes and pipe/s for extra winter/salt protection. Why don't they come as stainless steel from the factory!!Anyway what do you guys think?"
I think Halfords do a Hi temp paint. I have a woodburner and I have used ceramic paint for the stove from a fireplace shop. You may be able to get in silver. If you google exhaust system paint you should find what your after.
Thanks will have a Google about. I'm thinking black satin or matt.
The black ceramic paint I got for my woodburner was very good.
"Try plasti-dip. I have been using it for your years with exhaust tips, brake caliper, badges, plastic parts etc.... matt or gloss your choice.The best part is undoable and fixable if you stuff up on the way."
Thanks didn't realise/forgot PlastiDip could be used on hot parts.
The exhaust will out live the rest of the car. My 2002 A6 2.5 diesel still had the original exhaust after 9 years and 166K miles. just use chrome cleaner every couple of months on the chrome tail pipes
What is smallest size of number plate that can be used for 6 digit number. 16x 4.4??
If you are looking to reduce the width of the number plate the minimum gap between the characters and the edge of the plate is 11mm at each end
Rules are here..https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vehicle-registration-numbers-and-number-plates
Aside from your dealers lack of care this is happening because in Germany they don't tow with the fridges running in their caravans.
Cheers Bigmac! That answers the query and therefore I would of thought been common knowledge to dealers!Hopefully anyone on the forum reading this will take it up at the time of order with their dealer to avoid both my situation and possibly having to fork out for additional wiring job...Cheers and happy Easter....
i purchased the whole wiring kit from PF JONES which was a 100% complete and I was asked if I wanted it installed as the fridge and charging is dedicated to the car and requires extra wires for the car but the kit is 100% ready for the job.
I've just had the swivel towbar fitted at the stealer for a very good price ???? But upon inspecting this they have only done pin 9 & 11.There is no brass pin in 10!! I've not bought a caravan yet but looking too so would not having pin 10 be a pain for the switched live for the fridge? Or does the fridge now run from the permanent live?TIA.
The pins without any brass in are 10 and 12.12 I think isn't used for anything as the car recognises when somethings attached so this doesn't need to be used. 10 is the switched live I believe so not sure whether I need this as well as the permanent t live in pin 9. Pin 13 is another earth from what I can gather.I double checked and it is definitely pin 10 and 12 which don't have any brass in. Looks like I'll be phoning Audi then to get this switched live installed.Sorry I'm not that clued up on caravans and what pins I need to have! Permanent live I believe for aux battery charging and switched live for fridge!! I don't know..... ????
Been mentioned beforehttp://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/28665-q5-and-sq5-genuine-audi-towbar-and-electrics-module/page__pid__344041#entry344041
"Thanks, this took me to a towbar for sale and I saw your comment.I understand that part, and I asked the dealer to fit all required pins..... Yet on picking up the car it doesn't have pins 10 and pin 12 fitted!! It looks like I'll have to go back and ask them about Pin 10. But wondered if pin 12 is also needed as surely the BCM2 and electronics module will pick up when a trailer is attached so no need for pin 12???I just want to be 100% before I phone the dealership back.TIA"
"Awesome Steve, thanks so much for that.I've called the dealership and it's booked in to have the Pin 10 done. I may call them back before it goes in to mention about the loom and the split charge relay! The rest look really good from what I've seen as you mentioned. They did say I mentioned pin 9 & 11 to them but not pin 10! Why I'd ask for an earth and not a supply I'll never know! But at least hopefully they'll get it sorted properly this time! Fingers crossed anyway! Thanks again."
"Quick question, what is sq5 stealth, seen a couple with stealth badge on boot lid?"
have seen a couple but were not black!!
Ha ha
You live and learn!!
Which makes the Fuelly numbers even more incredible !!
REALLY!! Does it have 450bhp as mine does??
"Sorry forgot to say that heated seats, ditto my wife and leather seats, are an option on Q5 but quite often specified so should be no problem finding one with them fitted in front. Rear ones are quite rare but maybe I am not so generous to my kids as some others."
It there anyway on the Q5 of displaying the sat nav information on the MMI screen and the digital speedo at the same time instead of the nav data on the DIS also.
"Press the button on the bottom of the RH stalk to cycle DIS through Speedo, Mem 1, Mem 2, Efficiency, Sat Nav ...................."
Of course I have been looking for that button for ages getting mixed up between the wifes Q3 and my controls. Will try later cheers!!
"I bit the bullit today and got my AdBlue topped up, as I will be going on a long trip soon and at 21.4K I was worried the warning light would come on while away, just as good as it took 19 liters.I went to Audi to fill up and they were surprised I had got so far without a refill and at £1 50 a litre I didn't think that was too bad.2013 Q5 2 Iitre tdi S line."
I thought someone mentioned previously that you can get Adblue topped up for free at Audi dealerships?
"That's what I thought, but they did not charge for putting it in and at £28.50 that's the cheapest bill I'll ever have at Audi."
What oils are sq5 owners using in engine and gearboxs.
"For engine mine came with Shell (well that's what was in the boot so not 100% sure). But I'm topping up with Castrol Titanium as I believe it's currently the best oil for my SQ5. This is after emailing and asking questions to a couple different SQ5 oil spec companies, comparing spec data sheets and lots of googling.Don't know about gearbox..."
"Just measured the tread depth on my recently delivers SQ5 fitted with Pirrelli P Zero tyres, 5.5 mm at the deepest tread area!A new tyre typically has around 8mm when new!Is this a new ploy by tyre manufacturers to justify more sales?I checked the tread depth after reading about tyres having to be replaced after very low mileages, this is probably why!Audi owners should boycott all vehicles fitted with Pirrelli tyres.Audi are obviously aware of this issue but will buy into it with reduced tyre costs from Pirrelli, we need to nip this practice in the bud NOW before the rest of the tyre manufactures jump onto the bandwagon."
This could be down to the tyre type - its a big jump to say ALLWhat size tyres do you have?
"audiguru said:Just measured the tread depth on my recently delivers SQ5 fitted with Pirrelli P Zero tyres, 5.5 mm at the deepest tread area!A new tyre typically has around 8mm when new!Is this a new ploy by tyre manufacturers to justify more sales?I checked the tread depth after reading about tyres having to be replaced after very low mileages, this is probably why!Audi owners should boycott all vehicles fitted with Pirrelli tyres.Audi are obviously aware of this issue but will buy into it with reduced tyre costs from Pirrelli, we need to nip this practice in the bud NOW before the rest of the tyre manufactures jump onto the bandwagon.Click to expand...I wouldn't bye Pirelli again ,mine were finished in under 8k miles ,very poor wear ????????"

I have the 21 inch 255/40/21
I'm not sure power output makes any difference in this case - the TC and quattro limits the impact on the tyres..I have much more powerful cars and they are on rubber from the same manufacture without issues. I had one set for nearly 3 years.
"Like my pirrellis, just ticked over 17k kms, and would say I could do another 10k before the fronts need replacing. Haven't rotated mine so backs appear hardly worn. Given their size, I'm amazed how quiet they are as well."
"I've just realised u meant 5.5mm from new,wow that is being short changed from Pirelli ,that would explain the super early wear on mine if mine were the same,wich I assume all 21"" pirelis are,I've moved over to continentals on the rear,so we will c how they bear up ????"
My Dunlops on 7000 miles are wearing really well. Loads of life left in them.
+1 here.
Mine has just come with Bridgestones. Anyone any comments?
"Bridgestone's last well, even with a brutal SQ5 leaning on them with enthusiasm...."
"Had the Bridgestone's on our old Q5 2.0TDI S-Line (19"" standard) and the fronts lasted 24K on the fronts and about 32K on the rears, the SQ5 on Michelin (20"" standard) looks as if it will be similar, although fronts seem to be wearing more evenly (edges went on the old car first)"
mentioned the tyre issues to my Audi dealer;the 21 inch tyres apparently would overheat with sustained high speed driving if they had 8 mm tread.20 inch tyres will run OK at high speed with 8 mm tread.therefore seems to be the price you pay for asthetics
"Apologies Audiguru, but that overheating claim sounds like a load of usual Audi dealership tosh.I understand that the 21"" tyres - whether Dunlop, Pirelli or Bridgestone - all have a Y rating (good up to 186 mph) but the SQ5 has a speed limiter of 155mph anyway.Find me a road anywhere in the UK (or indeed Europe) where ""sustained high speed driving"" (ie. at or even below either figure) can be undertaken, and I'll eat my words.Less tyre tread from new = quicker wear = faster need for replacement = increased sales for the manufacturer....especially Pirelli it seems.Simples."
"Tyre manufacturers have long vied for the ability to provide OEM tyres to vehicle manufacturers at extremely competitive prices, often with low wear ratings because they know the end customer will probably replace like with like."
"Found a company in Maidstone Kent that can supply and fitt 21"" pirelis @£210 each or continental seals @£230 each ,very good prices ????"
"Just measured the tread depth on my recently delivers SQ5 fitted with Pirrelli P Zero tyres, 5.5 mm at the deepest tread area!A new tyre typically has around 8mm when new!Is this a new ploy by tyre manufacturers to justify more sales?I checked the tread depth after reading about tyres having to be replaced after very low mileages, this is probably why!Audi owners should boycott all vehicles fitted with Pirrelli tyres.Audi are obviously aware of this issue but will buy into it with reduced tyre costs from Pirrelli, we need to nip this practice in the bud NOW before the rest of the tyre manufactures jump onto the bandwagon."
I have Dunlops on mine too and coming up to 19k miles from new. Going in for its first service next week and I reckon the tyres will need replacing. Due to the high mileage I do I am glad I took out the full maintenance package.
SQ-B Can you supply their name / contact details?
Rospa recommend changing at 3mm that gives you 2.5mm of usable tread..that's a shocker
"Back to the original topic.I think all future potential owners should refuse to accept their SQ5`s fitted with 21 inch Pirrelli tryes, and all the owners out there like myself should not replace the Pirellis like for like.At least this will have a small impact on whatever Pirelli are up to with this con act issue."
"I'm still not getting this - has anyone else ""verified"" this is indeed the case?As far as i see - its just one person.And you can't pick the tyres so you have no choice, in the same way you cant pick winter tyres.To me thats more an issue than ""which brand"" thats open to opinion as to how long they will last or how noisy the tyres are...I really don't see this as an issue at all, so i would have no issues with them on my cars."
Nor me Snow Man...
Dan 01622 672 798 ????
"Yes, refuse to accept them and they might offer you to fit alternative brand, at around £300 per tyre or something.When you sign up for the car, there is no option for tyres, no mention, on configurator, with salesman, whoever, so i would imagine that refusing to accept their chosen brand of tyres is equivalent to refusing to accept the car, at moment of signing, which of course is anybodys perogative.If your car and tyres are still new, i would request to see another set of same on new model, to compare tread depth, to see if you can claim yours are a one off, faulty batch, or whatever."
"Well regardless off the tread depth pirelis are just to soft for the SQ's torque,(or my particular driveing) lol,but lowere tread depth may have defiantly played a part in my very early wear,my front wippers are shot now and need replacing ,nothing is lasting very long on mine,I'm still waiting to hear if there covering my rear discs under warranty (hopes so ) got 2 say this SUV has worn more out in a year than all my range sports and X5s,the longevity of parts these days appears poor ????????"
My view is this is why you have a new car - who cares about those getting them 2nd hand after you've abused the crap out of it...
"I have 21"" Pzero's fitted to my SQ5 which need to be changed today after 14,750 miles/11 months. Front tyres are no longer legal and about 3mm on the rear, so getting them all replaced. This came as a surprise as the Michelins on my previous 2.0 Q5 would last at least 18 months/20,000 miles.I am replacing with PZero's again, £205 per tyre, fitted on the drive."
I have the 2.0 tdi q5 with 20 inch wheels. Mine come with Goodyear excellence. Done 20000 miles still got plenty of thread left to do another 15000 easily. Ps I have a heavy foot on the gas and the brake.
"Got a feeling my new SQ5 will come with Pirelli on the 21 inch wheels but dreading it if it does Pirelli are shocking my new Disco 4 came with Pirelli tyres and they were bold in 11k its just shockingI am thinking of buying a set of dunlops and telling the dealer to fit them for me when they PDI my car before I get it, then I will sell the Pirelli tyres on ebay or something"
"Ask you dealership to swap them over and pay the difference, they wouldn't have any problem selling the Pirellis on."
Yes good point I will speak with the dealerI have just ordered 4 Michelin Latitude sport 3 255/40-21 tyres so will get the dealer to fir these before I take delivery of the car
Mine came with Bridgestone boots. But mine are 20in rims not 21in.
"Hi, where did you order the Michelins from - they are my preferred tyre...perhaps next time though."
"I ordered them through one of my suppliers as I am in the motor trade, they are on back order at present will be here in 6-8 weeksif you google the size there are suppliers out there that will sell them you see herehttps://www.tyre-shopper.co.uk/search/255-40-21/"
Many thanks ????
"Just measured the tread depth on my recently delivers SQ5 fitted with Pirrelli P Zero tyres, 5.5 mm at the deepest tread area!A new tyre typically has around 8mm when new!Is this a new ploy by tyre manufacturers to justify more sales?I checked the tread depth after reading about tyres having to be replaced after very low mileages, this is probably why!Audi owners should boycott all vehicles fitted with Pirrelli tyres.Audi are obviously aware of this issue but will buy into it with reduced tyre costs from Pirrelli, we need to nip this practice in the bud NOW before the rest of the tyre manufactures jump onto the bandwagon."
"Hi mate,I'd prefer Michelins as well, what happens to the Pirellis though, do you sell them on or has the dealer offered to take them off your hands?"
I have not got that far yet I will speak to the dealer next week explain what I want doing and offer them the Pirelli tyres if they don't want them I will sell them on myself
"Why not hang off until your car arrives, fingers crossed it might not have Pirellis, mine has Dunlops."
Dunlops cum with 8mm ????
"In December I reluctantly put Pirelli's (Pzero's) on my SQ5 again (had to at very short notice) and they were at least 8mm - the tyre fitter measured them too. Must only be 6mm when on the car from the factory, as I suspect mine were!"
"Simple way to resolve this issue.Write to Audi asking for technical details of the tyres fitted to vehicles as they leave he factory (tread depth)Write to Pirelli asking same about the same tyres sold on the open market through tyre dealerships.If there is a difference ask them why?For what its worth, mine came with Michelin Lattitude tyres which still had about 4mm of tread when I sold it with 29,000 miles on the clock."
I have spioken to michelin and confirmed that the depth of tread on a new Michelin-latitude-sport-3 is 7.9mm so i have ordered some today so i can take my winters off.I got them for £239 fitted each throughcartyres.comand fitted at halfords incase any one else wants michelins
"I too spoke to Michelin and they told me to expect around 10,000 miles fitted to a SQ5 not what i expected or wanted to hear"
it seems there is no stock in the uk anyway nothing till the end of march so they canceled my order.looks like i will have to have dunlops
"Most people on here have got on very well with the Dunlop's - durability-wise they seem to be amongst the best, but availability has often been a problem.If you can source them, I'd grab them while you can..."
I like P Zeros. I have them on both my cars.
I have managed to get some michies from tyre shopper which is national tyres but £10 a rim cheaper took the insurance at £7.5 a tyre also fitting next week so lets see..........
I noticed mine had Pirellis on when I saw it. I'll measure the tread depth when I get it home next week.......providing they don't get down to the wear bars on the way home!
"Me too, i don't want french rubber..."
Read on another forum that some Audi SQ5 owners are going up one size from stock 255 to 265 tyres which seem to fit the 21'' wheels better as the slight increase in size fills the arch gap better and sometimes can be bought for less than h 255's!! Have any of this forums members done this?
That would cause the speedo to misread slightly?
Going to 265's the speedo would under read by 1 mph from actual speed eg indicated 60mph - actual 61mph.
I just had to replace one of my P Zeros so have three factory P Zeros and one that is available on the open market. I will measure the depths tomorrow stay tuned.

"So update on tread depth the three 21"" P zeros on the car from new 5.5mm 4000 miles done.The new after market P zero 6.5mm."
6.2mm after how many miles?
Less than 100! So new tyres.
"I've been tyre shopping today and pinged this through to Pirelli;Hi,I've just realised why Pirellis on my Audi SQ5 have worn so quickly, apparently 5.5 mm as OEM, checked out replacement depth at 6.5mm - so I've opted for Dunlop at 8mm. I'll do 30,000 + miles per annum so that's 12 tyres you won't have to make for me, actually it's 16 has I've dumped the Pirellis on our 370z too.As yet no reply!"
I think it's for performance not to cheat you out of tread low profile.
"Hi,What is going on with the ""Pirelli boycott"", I've got a couple of emails from Pirelli confirming a tread depth of 8.5mm for 255 40 R21 102Y RO1 on both OEM tyres fitted to the SQ5 and as supplied to UK distributors.The problem may be with reading a tyre gauge correctly,Personally I'll be going back to Pirelli after I've chewed through the Dunlops, 33000 miles pa shouldn't take too long."
"MrZapie said:Hi,What is going on with the ""Pirelli boycott"", I've got a couple of emails from Pirelli confirming a tread depth of 8.5mm for 255 40 R21 102Y RO1 on both OEM tyres fitted to the SQ5 and as supplied to UK distributors.The problem may be with reading a tyre gauge correctly,Personally I'll be going back to Pirelli after I've chewed through the Dunlops, 33000 miles pa shouldn't take too long.Click to expand...Roughly how many miles did you get on each?"
"Hi,Fronts gone at 9000 2mm, put the old rears on the front which are now due for a change at 12000.As Pirelli are adamant about their 8.5mm tread Depth on new tyres I'm surprised their legal team haven't sent a warning shot across our bows asking to take this topic down.Cheers."
Is that Dunlops or Pirrelli that you got 9K and 12K miles and how did they compare to the other brand?
No stress here I used calibrated inspection equipment to measure my tread depth if they want to come and check they are more than welcome.
My new SQ5 came yesterday and had Dunlop SP Sports Maxx fitted. Are they decent??
"I have said and confirmed all along that the new OEM tyres fitted to my 21 inch alloys had 5.5 mm of tread when I checked them after driving home the 50 miles from the dealership. I used a vernier caliper to measure them at their deepest point to give Pirelli the benefit of any doubt. I approached my audi dealership who confirmed that they did not have full tread depth due to the performance capabilities of the car and the potential for overheating at 155 MPH. my mates car was delivered late last year with Dunlops with a full 8mm tread depth, lets see Pirelli squirm out of this argument."
My Dunlops had 6.5mm on them when measured with 250 miles done so no way were they 8.5mm when new
"Pirelli are hurting and rightly so, Camskill are selling the ROI versions of the Dunlops and the equivalent Pirelli, with the P-Zero at £50 per corner less than the Dunlops, the Dunlops have at least 8mm tread when new."
"I'd go Dunlop over Pirelli every time.1st Q5 - Pirellis - 12k miles2nd SQ5 - Dunlops - 17k milesCurrent SQ5 Plus - Pirellis...and not holding my breath.The problem is finding somewhere that has them (Dunlops) in stock. Seems to go in cycles - you find some, then they're gone, then it's another six months before they're back in stock somewhere else."
"Just collected my new car last week,Goodyear Excellence tyres, great result ! !Exactly what I was hoping for , they were on the 2 yr old I just traded in, 18,700 miles and hardly worn, even the salesman couldn't believe their condition, was happy they wouldn't need to change them !"

Hopefully I've got at least a year left in my Pirellis but am a Michelin Man at heart so will probably go for Latitudes when the time comes.Oponeo listing them at £208 which doesn't seem too bad.
"Sorry; doesn't work like that. You've no choice over what make of tyre a NEW car is shod with - if it's Audi approved then that's it, you take what the car comes with. No wriggle room. End of.When REPLACING tyres, that's entirely different (and in principle, I agree with your stance).Preferred make v. stock availability however? In my experience (currently on 3rd Q5), that's another matter altogether..."

So no one has picked up that some of the OEM tyres have a lower wear index so wear out faster than the aftermarket items? The logic being that owners will often replace like-for-like...
Had a early morning run in with a deer SQ5 won unbelievably just a few cuts and bruises. So booked into the bodyshop but not sure if it's at the new premises.
I was shown round there tonight. They do minor body work at the new facility and major repairs are carried out at John Clark.
Cool luckily I think it's minor but you don't know till they start having a look.
"Yeah, it always costs far more than you think it will."
"If its minor, you should look at alternatives rather than 'Audi original parts'Minor paintwork, dinks, etc can be resolved invisibly at a quarter of the price.I believe Audi is over £100 per hour labour, if non-warranty work.I had my wing mirror knocked, housing fell apart and the lens shattered.I'm sure if I'd gone to Audi it would be a £3-400 full reconstruction job, but I fixed the housing back together like a jigsaw (no dents fortunately) and bought an 'original' lens from a VW type supplier, exactly same, £48, job done"
Booked in now I wanted to use official Audi parts and get professional job done. Plus no time at the moment due to new baby I'll post a pic of the damage unbelievable due to killing a deer!
"Bet that deer was not too happy about the outcome, either LOL"
I had no where to go three ran in front middle one got it.
Needs a bit more than T cut.
"My mate down in Perth, Western Australia had these little plastic flute type cones fitted to the front corners of his Focus ST, they are designed to give off a high pitch whine which is invisible to the human ear, but audible to wildlife to deter kangaroos jumping in front of the car, he swears that they actually work. Might be worth a shot with our Deer!"
Yes I have heard of them a guy at work has one but not fitted it yet.
Why not have a speaker that emits the same sound from the front grill instead of a cone?
I take it just uses the wind when your driving along.
"For what it is worth I tried these ""deer whistles"" when they appeared on the market 10 or 11 years ago but was never convinced of their efficacy at deterring deer from wandering into my path. In fact the one deer I have actually made contact with in recent years, a Roe rather than a Red thankfully, made it's lunge when I had a whistle attached to the front grille."
"The most I have squeezed in is 69.5 litres, from memory I think I was down to about 25 miles to go with the needle just touching the empty mark. I regularly put in 63-65 litres when it is halfway across reserve."
Just installed interior led lights. All is well apart from the rear reading lights which don't work. (Only had the car a week and not sure if they have ever worked).I guess it's not the fuse as everything else works. Can someone please confirm that the rear reading lights don't have their own fuse.Thanks
Might need to take them out and turn them around (switch polarity)?
Tried turning the led's.Put the original bulbs back in and still no joy. Will ask dealer to look at it tomorrow when it's having the rattling parcel shelf sorted out.Thanks
Sounds like a fuse then or the contacts are not making contact with the LED/bulb?
Do the rear reading lights have their own fuse ?The handbook doesn't really explain.
"How do I work out the correct market value of my SQ5 for insurance purposes? Parkers says £36K, Compare the Market automatically said £31K. 1 year old in June. Suggestions?"
"Don't think it really matters too much mate, go high, doubt it will affect the premium either way but if you are unfortunate enough to have it stolen or written off they will come up with their own value anyway. GAP would then make up the difference."
"If it's £31k in less than a year, thats some monster hit you've taken.Its worth whatever someone would pay you for it, but as mentioned above, for insurance go high, I'd be inclined to say at least 40k"
Have you looked at the Audi website for a used car valuation?
"If its for insurance purposes it doesn't really matter much, you'll only get FMV..we buy any... will give you the current trade price and that's what you'll get paid out (eventually) if something happens - so i'd take a look at that."
... And be prepared for a shock before you look at the wbac value
"There are a few alternatives to WBAC, most offer more. I used the best offer I found to prompt my supplying dealer to make a more realistic offer for the last SQ. The official line is that SQ prices are 'softening' because it's the summer and that the current model is close to EOL."
"I think before taking any decision, Audi's website must be checked."
"Rather than looking for similar modelson the Approved Used Area try:Audi web siteOwners tabAudi Owners AreaScroll down to ""I want to"", select ""value a vehicle""Enter registration and mileage and continue.This method of valuation got me £600 more for my last car when I confronted the dealer with the Audi figure."
I know a great Audi independent Garage who do all that Audi do on servicingetc.Wouldthis affect warranty on car??Thanks.
"If they use genuine Audi parts then technically the warranty should stand. However, I'm sure that should a warranty claim arise then Audi would look less favourably at the claim as the car has been serviced outside their dealer network. I had the same dilema recently and chickened out and has the oil and filter change done by Audi even though I know my local excellent independent garage would have done it for half the cost. Worth shopping around the dealers as their rates vary widely for the same work. My supplying dealer wanted £279 for the oil and filter change but my local dealer price matched Lincoln Audi and did the job for £229. At the end of the day these are expensive and complicated vehicles so the running costs go with the territory I suppose."
Have you tried taking your own oil to an Audi service?I did this with Porsche as they charged at least double the retail price for Mobil 1. So this saved quite a lot off the first service.
"Thanks,Yes, some put the price on. This guy i know does use genuine Audi parts, but its warranty i am frightened of."
"No, but i asked them if i could supply my own oil on last Audi, as i dont like it coming out of bigbarrel.Theysaid a definate NO."
Go to a different Audi dealer ????
I will try that mate thanks
"That's complete and utter tosh...You're entirely free to do exactly as you choose (and as confirmed to me by the Dealer Principal at a local Audi outlet), albeit I / they would always recommend using whatever oil brand is currently in the vehicle - Mobil 1, Shell Helix etc. etc.Buy your own (Asda on-line is a good place to start), chuck it in the boot pre-service and tell them to use it, making sure they put used bottles back in the boot for evidence.They might try to charge for used-oil disposal however, but otherwise do exactly as you wish... there's absolutely no obligation / contract to use dealer-supplied products anywhere."
I think I will be doing that but with the latest spec Castrol oil.How many litres do I need to supply?
"Just put in 'mystery shopper' call to one (unnamed) Audi dealership.Full oil change on a 3 litre diesel Q5 would use 6.8-7 litres of oil.Price quoted was £18.85 per litre (x 7 = £132.95 excluding labour).Asda, Amazon etc. currently have on-line offers at £5 -7 per litre.You do the maths..."
"As above, anyone bothered to update their NAV maps? Cost, experience?I note all the newer cars in the Audi range with connect now come with 3 years free map updates, Q5 doesn't."
"I'm interested in the map update thing too, the Q3 misses out on the Connect update. I found a link on Ebay for Cambridge Audi who were offering the update (dealer visit, 4-5 hours) for £181...."
"4-5 hours for putting in a DVD... f******* nuts.., Has Corbyn and his union monkeys taken over Audi?I'll have a go at doing it myself, the trick will be generating the activation code.On one of my other (Audi) cars with ""real"" connect, you just download the map update to an SDcard, pop it in and your done. takes 30mins start to finish."
"Googling it Snow Man I found a lengthy post on A5OC on doing it manually and avoiding all the error codes, it looked painful..."
"I have done the firmware and map upgrade mmi 3g hdd to K0257-6-1 and maps 6-20-4 on my 2012 q5 and all went ok.Note you do need the hidden menu to do it and a 32gb fast sd card, it takes a few hours to complete."
Thats the older basic version and its not too hard to do.The 3GP system is much more complicated lengthy.I saw the post on the A5OC and that mostly seems to be 3G HDD too.
you need vag-com to allow green hidden menu.I downloaded the maps and activation details on line about 28gb
"Barbyboy said:ChapsJust back from half term ski break and have managed to do the best part of 1800 miles in a week travelling to and from the French Alps - the first proper long haul journey in the SQ5 for me.Observations:More UK cars on the autoroutes than French ones (!) but didn't see another SQ5 all week.Ironic that good French lane discipline meant swift / safe progress was made by everyone. Once back in the UK, the middle lane muppets reappeared...Return journey yesterday was 810 miles - left at 6am local time and was back in Warwickshire at 5.30pm - 12.5 hours door to door including Tunnel crossing - do the figures yourself - yep, we'll just call it ""rapid progress"".Mostly drive the car in Dynamic mode (still can't resist the sound) but switched to Efficiency mode on the autoroutes and saw marked improvement in fuel economy - circa 42mpg average for the entire journey.First time I've properly used the ACC, Side / Lane assist features: ACC is fantastic - took a while to get used to (car decelerates when approaching a car in front unless you indicate / change lanes in time) but, it made the journey so much more effortless. However, it's a pretty hopeless feature for using on UK roads - heavy traffic / congestion means that maintaining a constant speed is nigh on impossible.Niggles:Only one - screen wash tank capacity is too small. Constant traffic spray meant frequent use was needed and combination of screen cleaning, driving light washing and rear window cleaning emptied the tank quickly. Have resorted to keeping a top-up bottle in the boot.Overall conclusion:I just LOVE this car. Still puts a smile on my face every time I get in it but now desperately needs some TLC and a thorough valet - am convinced that today I have the filthiest SQ5 in the UK.Click to expand...Totally agree, French lane discipline put us to shame...I'm looking forward to my trip down to Cognac in the summer..."

Did you have winter tyres fittrd ?
"Missile - yes...and they worked a treat - Pirelli Snow and Ice tyres 255/45's fitted to 20"" wheelsFirst night in resort - 30cm of snow and car chewed through it effortlessly.Our place is on the French / Swiss border and bizarrely, you'd think with all that Swiss efficiency tosh, they'd be used to clearing the roads after a heavy downfall.In reality, the French seem to do a much better job of it..."
"Certainly better than in the UK, where it seems 1/2"" of snow brings total chaos.We are on a road trip through Germany and Switzerland in June. Do you know if there is a similar peage pass to be had?Where are your photos?"
Thanks for the info.I was more interested in your skiing photos.See here for info on how to upload photos.http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/5905-free-beer-thread/Compress the photos before you try to upload them.
Thanks for the info... That could come in handy...
"Quick question, if you have winter tyres do you still have to carry chains with you under french traffic regs?"
Welcome back mate! Glad to hear you're still enjoying and had a great trip. We were originally going to fly down to Spain however i think we have changed our minds and are now tempted to do a small road trip down through Paris to Monaco... thoughts on this idea?Post some pics if you managed to take any mate!
"gobiman said:Barbyboy,Thanks for the comments.We do it every year - essentially my wife flies out Friday evening/Saturday morning with children and I drive out during Friday to meet them.This year we did Friedrichshafen (I stayed in the airport IBIS overnight - wife +kids came on Monarch Sat morning). However still bad congestion into Austria at 1100. It seems that half of Holland is on the road - they must drive overnight Friday to be there that early!We then all drive back SaturdayMy cunning plan for next year is to meet the family at Munich airport on the Friday night (cheap late flights at 2000), all stay in an airport hotel and then leave early to beat the rush.Coming back we will depart Friday after skiing, overnight around Karlsruhe and be at Eurotunnel just after midday.As you point out and we found out, UK Border Control simply cannot cope with the flow later in the afternoon and it backs up. I've just sent a complaint e-mail as it was exactly the same last year. Since they moved the border control to just after check-in a few years ago (and tightened the checks), it has been terrible every half-term.I'll have to order an SQ5 in the next few months if I want to use it for this run nxt year!Click to expand...Driving seems to be the prudent way to do things - flights at half term for four of us would have been £1300 (Easyjet Birmingham to Geneva rtn) + car hire another £600 = £1900.Taking the car was £150 with Eurotunnel, spent about £170 on fuel, £120 on tolls and £75 for the overnight stay at Calais (Holiday Inn Coquelles) = £515.The difference worked out to be nearly £1400.Teenage kids + skiing holiday (4 x 7 day lift passes = £750) = expensive trip.Ouch."
"Hi Ray, good to hear from you and when are you thinking of going to France / Monte Carlo?I'll be in Monaco for the GP (25th May) and as yet, haven't decided on whether to drive or fly.Same issues being faced re flight costs as per thread above, but it would be a much longer road trip and I'd be driving solo (am meeting clients down there).Keep me posted on your plans and if you need any guidance, don't hesitate to ask.Cheers."
And here was me thinking spanking a grand on my ski trip next week was expensive! At least it's just me going!
Yup - difficult to do a week's skiing (in reasonable comfort in a decent resort) for less than a grand a head.However the advantage of driving is it does keep the costs down for 4 and you can avoid the rip-off half-term package prices + air fares.I paid around £4k all-in. To do the equivalent with Neilson/Crystal etc would have been £8-10k flying on a package.
"hi did you have any problem with the tag placement on the screen ? ive just got one and it says to put on"" the mottled"" part of the screen but the car doesnt have one .simon"

"Not a chance, stage 2 is 400bhp, stage 3 would be in the region of 450bhp.You would need bigger turbo's and a full engine rebuild to get those kind of numbers.....if it is even possible.790bhp in an RS6/7 requires full exhaust, map and bigger turbos and that started life having 552bhp"

"Mine is here too. Went to the alps last month, worked perfectly"
thanks guys
Is this the same cost as going through the french tolls as normal?
"...Essentially, yes. There is however a small annual charge; here's the link:https://www.saneftolling.co.uk/support/faq/support-Faq.List/#1.0.The convenience of toll queue avoidance, searching for coins or cards (and paying from the front passenger window) far outweighs the minimal admin fee IMO."
"It's about 5 euros a year iirc - I just leave it running even if I don't plan to go to France this year.When you're there, it can make a big difference in journey time just avoiding the queues (you can tag at 30kph)"
You only pay for for the monthly charge when you use it. Otherwise it is just the initial setup cost and the annual 6 euro fee. Its a great system.
if you've got a tunnel crossing booked and use the link from their webpage put your booking reference in and they waive the 20 euro deposit and 10 euro fee i've heard
Hi allMy car has just hit 10 months old and 15k miles.When should I expect the first service?Cheers
Have a look at the Servicing section on your MMI and it will tell you.
As above the MMI screen will tell all. Expect around £340 to £350 for the first service.
"Just had 1st service@9 months, 10,000miles: £277"
"it will probably remind you around the 18,000 mile mark..."
Thanks for your responses- I just wanted to make sure I hadn't missed anything!I had them throw in a service package for 3 yrs servicing ... They even agreed to collect my car from 50miles away.. So can't complain
What prices are people being quoted?Wakefield Audi have just told me its £529 for the first service. Car is 9 months old and has done 14000 miles.I suspect I'm being taken for a ride at that price?
"Just had mine serviced at Nottingham Audi they quoted £404 including pollen filter. After bit of discussion paid £360. Lincoln Audi quoted £375. Cars done just over 19,000 miles."
Anyone know what a estimate for the first 2 services would be on an Audi SQ5 Pluscheers
"Sj1000 said:Audi are pretty vague on this, both in the brochure and when actually buying the car.My MMI was set to 10,000 miles or 1year, (through no choice of mine)When I took it in, the rather helpful service manager told me it was a waste of time and money doing this simple oil change now, then having to return @ 19,000 for the full service check.He said the original oil is more than good enough for 19,000miles, and it hadn't lost a drop, so rather than taking my money he just came out to the car and re-set the MMI to 19,000.I took it back a year later and they did the whole lot combined for £327.Mine isn't the SQ5 but I'm sure the same applies.Click to expand...So when you come to trade the car in and someone checks the service history it will be missing the first service ?"
"Nope - the 10k/1 year is a fixed term service whereas the 19k/2 year is a variable. Provided you have the correct oil and depending on the type of driving you do, the variable is perfectly acceptable. My dealer also set mine up as fixed and had to change it to variable after I stamped my little foot several times ......................"
If the 10k one year service is fixed should it not have been done ? I only ask as my sq5 is soon to be one year old only done 4K miles and getting a lot of hassle from Audi to book my car in and it has to be done as the oil is only good for a year so they tell me
"As I started my post off with ..Audi are pretty vague on this, both in the brochure and when actually buying the car.Ridiculous really that it's so open ended, and seems dependant mainly on the owner and any particular service manager in any particular dealership."
"Actually it's not ridiculous at all, you car is probably on the default variable service interval.If you have variable service intervals turned on then the car will figure out when you need a service depending on how you drive it and the duration of your journeys. Spend a lot of every week doing motorway stuff, engine at a near constant speed and hot and the service interval will stretch out to 18 or 19,000 miles. alternatively if you do predominately short journeys when the engine never really gets super hot then the oil will break down faster and you will need a service sooner."
"I do 20k a year, should i change to long life? Otherwise i need an oil service in 2000 miles!"
You need to be on variable service intervals...
"Came across this on YouTube, sounds like a beast! What do you guys think? Too much or pretty good?"
No way that's a 3ltr TDI sounds like they dubbed the sound over.
When I saw the title on the clip I wasn't sure what to expect!
Aye maybe I just makes you wonder why they had to fake it on the SQ5.
"I'm perfectly happy with the stock 3.0 L TDI. I guess I got over the need for noise with my last motorcycle, a BMW R1100S with a Vanderlinde custom exhaust. Today, I'm way into quiet, comfortable, and when called upon, kick-ass acceleration. My Q5 does the trick nicely!"
Like a bit of rasp me.
Had anybody tried this on an SQ5? Cant see any aftermarket systems for the SQ5?!
Yeah makes you wonder with the SQ5 power increase what the soundtrack would be.
"HiJust started to look at insurance for ordered, but yet to arrive SQ5 Plus.I would be intrigued to know what insurance companies members are using.ThanksIan"
Admiral Multicar - SQ5 Plus + VW Golf Cabrio TSI = £450 pa with 10 yrs NCD and rural postcode.Previously with Hastings Direct - roughly £50 pa more.
"interesting, i've never tried the multi-car options i was quoted 441 just for sq5+ +MrsSI should for A1, SQ5+, & 3.2 TT & daughter's Twingo4 yr NCD (was always named driver - stupid) never had an accident in 30+ years50, rural Somerset."
admiral multicar here too. for the sq5 and my daughters' C1the boxster is on a separate Aviva policy for £200-odd
"Direct line, fully comp with protected no claims and all the legal and car hire boxes ticked, £475"
"Another vote for Admiral multicar. I'm paying circa £900 for the SQ5, 3.0 A4 cab and 140bhp Golf with my youngest son (20) as the policy holder on the Golf (accounts for about £500 of the total). I couldn't believe how cheap the insurance for the SQ5 is about £240.Been with them for 4 years now, has let my oldest son build up his own 3 yr NCD.They are good value but I suppose only a claim would reveal how good their customer service actually is."
"Hi,Please feel free to give us a try for insurance when you're ready. If you wanted to PM me some contact details I'd be happy to arrange for one of my quotes team to give you a call back.Regards,Dan."
SQ5 full business use was around £400 for wife and I (8 years NCD) in rural bucks as part of Admiral multi car policy
"LV= charging approx £450 for Mr & Mrs H; full NCD (Protected), business use, 18k miles pa, hire car, Europe use etc etc ..............................."
"Just remembered that the biggest change to costs when I looked at renewing the SQ5 insurance in March was annual mileage, car in garage or drive made no difference so I guess don't put down 15K if you're only going to do 10K, not sure what would happen if you go over and haven't informed them"
"Well impressed, put in four cars to admiral for 2 fifty somethings and 21 & 24 years old. On an ;SQ5+, TT V6, A1 s-line, Reault twingoBeing quoted £1210 per yearOver 1.1k cheaper than what I have currently.So even with Audu SMART cover I'm still £600 better off.Proof comes though when you make a claim.But it is a real no brainier as far as I can see"
Direct line no tracker needed
"My car is drawing some unwanted attention from the birds. It seems to be a magnet for bird sh1t. I keep some baby wipes in the car, but wonder if anyone has a better alternative?"
"I did get some bird dropping wipes in the life shine kit that came with the car, Auto Glym probably get them from Halfords."
are they better than baby wipes?
Probably not and probably no better than a wet tissue.
Shotgun ???
I was thinking maybe an aqueous spray cleaner would work better?
"When you stop to park up the car, get out, then get back in and move it one space over.Should be fine then."
"Well prevention is the best remedy. Don't park somewhere where you can see bird cr@p on the floor, or under trees, next to lamp posts etc"
"Not really an option for me. Our property in surrounded by mature trees. We are near the coast and when weather is bad offshore, as it usually is LOL, we have seagulls."
"How about a rubber one with suckers for feet, just leave it on there 24/7?"
In the hangar I worked in they had a plastic bird of prey on the overhead crane. You can imagine the damage that bird droppings could cause in aircraft assemblies. Seemed to be very affective.
You can hire my wife. Her moustache frightens the kids.
"Hi,I hear that Audi have nearly finished building the Mexican factory which will be producing the next generation Q5. Does anyone know when we are likely to be able to order these....after the new A4 it should be a wowser!!"
"I thought it might be unveiled at the Geneva motor show, but they only came up with the new Q2.I personally dont think it will be this year now, I've got impatient waiting and ordered one of the 'last' German made ones to hedge my bets.In a year or 2 I'll have another look to see what the reviews are like, and maybe consider it again"
"I, for one, am not an ""early adopter"" when it comes to cars, tech and the like. Despite companies best intentions, teething problems are more likely in the first year or so. Unfortunately, the next generation Q5 has the odds stacked against it. A new car being built in a new factory in a country that has no history of building ""premium"" cars, or any cars for the European market for that matter.......and it's a long way away, so that doesn't bode well for delivery times.It'll be interesting to see how it all pans out for the new Q5!"
"Yep, it seems unfeasible, just up-sticks to the other side of the world, train up locals and produce German pedigree cars.But, it won't/can't be ( surely?) it's 99% automated, and Audi/VW are investing 1.3 billion euros in the venture.How many Q5's do they have to sell to break even on the deal ???Amazing scenes, big business etc etc, but I'll just get my 2016 End-of -Line German model , (which will suddenly look old fashioned) and sit back and look on for a while."
"Not only new factory, model and workforce but it may be new supply chain and component manufacturers also."
"That's good news.i'm sure those built in Mexico will/must have the same quality control and standards, but there's always the capacity for teething problems with such a massive venture.Also, i buy Audi's because they're 'Made in Germany' and just can't get away from the fact I feel reassured by that, and believe it helps the residuals.i'm probably misguided in my thinking, but there it is."
"If the new Q5 is going to be more square cut like the Q7 I think I prefer the current model, which I think is quite a good looking car. Do we though stick with the current model or wait for new one probably in a year or so?"
better to buy the last of a proven model than the first of a new model in my opinion.
I am in no hurry to trade my car.
"my current Q5 will be about 2yrs old when the new Q5 is well established.i'm looking forward to changing to the new model already because the current Q5 does need a massive update, but i coulsn't hold out on my old Q5 until the new one arrived so i bought one of the last of the current Q5's, and to be honest it does seem a slight improvement in build quality and cabin noise on my MY14 model."
My master plan is wait for the RS Q5 and hope most of the problems are weeded out in the early Q5's.

My understanding is that 4 wheel drive increases rolling resistance and also fuel consumption? Must admit I prefer the 'old fashioned' permanent 4 wheel drive to the haldex.
"Hi,I hear that Audi have nearly finished building the Mexican factory which will be producing the next generation Q5. Does anyone know when we are likely to be able to order these....after the new A4 it should be a wowser!!"
"Found this interesting,http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-news/tech/review-audis-new-for-2016-quattro-with-ultra-all-wheel-drive-system/"
"I also wonder how reliable the electronics will be. As usual it's ok when new but what about when 5 or 6 years old. Coupled with DSG and engine controllers and now this, the chances of expensive repairs down the line seems more likely.There were now't wrong wi' Morris Minors."
Everyone I know that's had non permanent four wheel drive systems in a lot of different car manufacturers say it's crap. They just do not work as good you're stuck before it kicks in especially in snow.
The more i read about the new Q5 the less i am liking it
"Maybe, maybe not. The article says it will not be fitted to engines above 370PS; the new SQ may be around 340?"
"It actually says 370lb ft, that's torque (twisting force) not power.Audi are pretty good at sorting advanced engineering concepts and producing usable reality so I'll keep an open mind."
"Yep, current plus is 700nm or about 520 ft lb so new SQ5 should be way over the 370 mentioned."
"I found my 2009 Honda CR-V very good in snow, better than my 2012 Tiguan. Not had my Q5 in snow."
Doh!
"In my anything-but-humble opinion, I think the late model Q5's are one of the most gorgeous vehicles on the road. I'm 11 months into mine with about 15,000 miles, and I positively love it (except for the MMI). From all I've seen about the new Q7 (actually seen it in person) and the images I've seen on the alleged new 2017 Q5, I'm glad I got mine and didn't wait for the new one. Audi finally got the current Q5 just right (the latest headlight did the trick). The new Q7 and alleged Q5 leave me cold. Good thing it's a non-issue for me, as I plan to keep my current car for a while."
"Yep,I'm picking up a new S-Line plus in about a week, so I imagine it will be one of the last ones to withinn 4 or 5 months.SteveMak, if you wanted to do the same now, you'd get a great deal i would think, got a decent price for mine secured, then negotiated 11% off the new"
Only if you buy another one and register it after 1st April 2017.
"Yes I don't think the Government can retrospectively apply this as how many years could they go back on car values, technically forever!!"
Don't give that sh1t Osborne ideas.
Yes only on new cars registered from 1st April.What the hell has the price of a car got to do with Road Tax.
I'm just hoping they teach the poor how to repair the roads or go without benefits...
So let me get this straight you pay your road tax and then £310 on top of that every year for 5 years if your car is over 40 grand.
Exactly
So buy your new £40K car before April 01st 2017
But I want to wait for the new SQ5/RSQ5 í ½í¸­ Ho well better get the mother of all deals and get it under the 40 grand mark LOL.

"Diesel is dead going forward, but you never know they might want to reuse the development effort for the V8 and put it inNice electric turbo.."
I bet it will be calculated on the list price. Too many potential loopholes otherwise :-(
Yes! - £450 per year for 5 years after 1st year!
seriously? i think my Q5 is only £175 per year.but if you ever drive in the UK you will understand why when you see the state of our roads! atrocious!
"yes, but having worked in NL for 4 years, I would not recommend driving there with their crowded & jammed roads and hidden, grey painted, speed cameras."
"When I worked in NL, the Police had Porsches patrolling the motorways. Nice job if you can get it!"
What happens if you buy a second hand car which was first registered in 2017 within the 5 year period? Will this kill the second hand market for the 5 year period?
So if car manufacturers try to save the environment and make a luxury Eco model that is tax free but is more than 40 grand you will still pay road tax that is not on!
"Agree, same as the P11D valuation ................"
"How many manufacturer loaded special editions will start to appear at a list price of £39,999.00 ?"
"I was surprised to learn there are 28 million cycles in the UK. Fortunately, it seems very few are regularly used on the roads."
"my dealer already said that he expects Audi to deliberately load cars as much as they can whilst keeping them under the £40K mark next year - in competition with every other manufacturer trying to provide the most attractive car under the £40K benchmark.it's going to be hard to push an S-Line Plus out for under £40K, never in a million years with an SQ5 / RSQ5"
I know but the price of your car does not save polar bears it's emissions
"This whole thing is corrupt and fubar, if you buy a zero emission, planet healing Tesla, you have to pay the standard 'zero' rate plus £310?The only way to make it a truly environmental tax is to abolish VED and put it on the price of fuel. An SQ5 driver doing 30k per annum pays about £50 less in tax than I do for an A4 covering about 5K, where's the logic in that unless emissions is actually the last thing you are concerned about."
"That fucker Osborne has taken our overly complicated VED system and made it even worse. I wonder how much money has been wasted by the civil service to devise this and how much of the extra revenue generated will be squandered on the pen pushers required to implement it.If my arithmetic is correct it will be circa £1350 extra in tax over 5 years for a new SQ5 after April 2017. PIA, but not enough to affect my choice of car."
"any 'green' tax is just a money making stealth-tax scam.no point us in the civilised world trying to be self-righteous and penalising ourselves for self gratification when you visit other less 'concerned' countries and they couldn't give a damn - spewing all sorts of stuff into the air, the waterways and the land in general."
Like the USofA ?
Almost as difficult as registering a dog? <LOL>http://roscommondaily.com/2016/03/dog-registered-and-microchipped-march-31/I would like to see compulsory cycle proficiency test and helmets
"New owner of a Q5 2.0! I have used PPF on my last two cars (BMW M5 and Porsche Cayman) and appreciate the protection the product offers. However I always debate with myself as to how far to cover the vehicle (just front bumper or the entire front clip). I don't care to stop the film half-way through any panel due to the dirt that ends up collecting on the edges of the film thus partial coverage of the fenders/hood is not something I'm willing to do. Can anyone out there tell me their experience with the Q5 design and where they have seen rock chips/""road rash"" show up on their Q5 (front bumper only, fenders, hood, etc)?"
what's PPF?
"Guessing, Paint Protective Film"
"I have 3rd generation PPF self-healing film on, front bumper, complete hood, fenders, mirrors, headlights, fogs, and around and over the top of the windscreen.Last car was peppered from all the motorway driving I do. So far so good with the PPF, no marks at all, so I would recommend it. Although I consciously hang back further from cars in front of me more so then I did with last car. I also avoid gritters like the plague."
"It so depends on the driving you are doing. I got 683 miles out of a tank back in September on a road trip (took 72 litres to fill), but I usually get a lot less."
"Been to Cornwall and back in last three weeks and I got 560-odd on a tank (20 mile range when filled up). Even better, as used local Tesco for shopping and a 'few' *cough cough* bottles of wine down there using Clubcard, managed to get 16p a litre off for the tank-full to come back (still just under half full)."
What spec is your Q5?I've got the 2.0tdi 177ps stronic managed 510 from my first full tank all city driving. Think I could have squeezed another 50 miles but didn't fancy chancing it.
Added to sig now (hopefully!) - but the 177 2.0 TDI
The later 177 engines seem much better on fuel than my earlier 170 one then.
Ribsta: How many miles are you getting tank to tank?
Something wrong with Leeds?
"Hi Dermu, normally I'm stretching to get 500 miles. That's with an average 30mph showing on the computer.Snowman: Haha. Leeds not so bad. Stayed at the double tree Hilton which was nice!"
"No, not something - everything...."
Such as?
How many litres of juice are you guys managing to squeeze in?
Totally!
Yeah well done.
Dermu: I think it took 72 litres on the re-fill.
I just filled up 66 litres with 30 miles still showing on the dis. Seems bizzare that the tank has a 75 litre capacity. I guess it's a hidden reserve that the DIS does not show you.conchris2: you doing mixed driving to achieve those results? I'm guessing that your engines been nicely run in?
"I'm at 6,500 miles, I've got a 50 mile round trip commute which Is mostly dual carriageway so that really helps the MPG, against that Is the school run which Is a 3 mile stop/start affair, It all seems to average out at 40MPG..I'm quite gentle on the right foot and very rarely break the speed limits.....boring git!!!!"
"Drove upto York yesterday, (very fast past leeds so the pikeys couldn't remove the wheels) we averaged about 38.the economy seems to be going down as we put on more miles, but its still better than the previous Q5."
"Yer agree, mine seems to be less, silly I know but was wondering whether the colder days is playing a part in less MPG.Was getting over 40 MPG when just poodling along now 37/38 on the motorway."
"Yeah, could well be, as the air is already cold and dense.That said, I'm still happy as its better than the previous one, ."
"I will be more than happy with anything higher than my ML averages which is about 31/32, although admittedly theres less appetite to give it some heavy right foot in the Merc, so I may be being optimistic."
Diesel fuel is modified for winter and gives less mpg.
"I'd put my lower MPG down to using air con more and stronger winds, colder temps etc.You'd be amazed how much a head wind affects your MPG..."
"maybe so, but tail wind would cancel that effect out and one could say the same about driving up hill. I tend to use A/C more during summer <LOL>"
The 2.0T petrol HATES short journeys and will do about 25mpg average if the wife is going to work / shopping in it. It comes into its own on longer trips though. We got 485 miles out of a tank on a trip away in October half term.
"I wondered about fuel economy during winter. Last year I spoke to the local Audi dealer about mine reducing by 3 mpg and they said it shouldn't. But if the fuel suppliers change the diesel as Missile says, then maybe, but doesn't really make sense why you still lose economy? Can it be that different?"
I guess the auxiliary heater must have an effect on the economy...
"Engines become more efficient when they have warmed up. Stands to reason that, in the cold weather, more fuel is used to reach that temperature. It's a big old lump to heat up!"
http://www.metrompg.com/posts/winter-mpg.htmDidn't think of the reduced tyre pressure due to denser air...Main factor prob the additives to the fuel for winter use
"I think this is probably the biggest contributory factor.5. Lower average engine temperatureIn the winter, an engine takes longer to reach operating temperature and cools off faster when shut off. Since the engine management system orders up a RICHER MIXTURE when cold (proportionately more fuel in the air/fuel combination), more fuel is being burned overall."
"Reading here with diesel owners and via a friend with a diesel Q5 that the economy is better, long distance without using air conditioning. Using the most sensitive L/100k fuel consumption indicator on my Q5, I find no change, and me with a lowly 2.0l petrol.Is it a diesel phenomenon ?"
@Pg220 - I agree - I stick it in sport - turn off the visible MPG displays and drive!
Well I'm not sure a 2.0 diesel Q5 is quite living at the max - I'm hoping to hit a higher peak at some stage although I appear to be going backwards now I've added kids into the mix!Nice spec on yours by the way - I would imagine if I saw it I wouldn't be able to tell it apart from mine unless I spotted the Alcantara.
"You can compare your fuel economy to other similar vehicles atwww.fuelly.com. BTW, carrying additional weight, whether it's people or luggage, will decrease your fuel economy. If your kids are drivers too, then their less conservative driving style might negatively impact your fuel economy too."
"Stiffer tyre side walls? I would have thought the opposite on that one. Over inflated tyres will give better mpg, but wear out the centre of the tyre."
that's almost double my average MPG here in England!
"Hi my dealer said my sq5 plus is due to start being built week 16 does anyone know roughly what is the cut off for changing anything on the car ,I keep checking Audi track my order and it's still on order received?"
"Check with your dealer as soon as you can.I tried to change something on my order 6 weeks before build date and was told the order was ""locked"", however that 6 weeks did straddle the Christmas factory closure."
"Mine is to be built in Wk14. I told it was locked down this week wk11.There is Easter over that period.I thought about a colour change, but I guess this is an early item that has to be fixed up front for obvious reasons.You can change, it just pushes the build date back and for me an April build gave me a further 2k discount I was told by dealer.I've stuck with Lava Grey...."
I don't want to push date back anymore as we have to give our dealer our car in April to get a good deal for our q5 sline plus but I was looking at blue diamond stitching on seats
"The blue stitching on the seats was only available on the limited edition Macaw Blue vehicles of which very few were made and I don't think any came to the UK. SQ5 Plus seats are black with grey stitching, no other options are available unfortunately, not even the two colour choice available on the SQ5."
Hi could you not change stitching when you select leather package plus as dealer said we could swap but might delay production so have chose to leave alone
"Leather package plus on SQ5+ will only add the leather covered instrument cowl (armrests are already leather as part of SQ5+ package) and this will have black stitching. I see in the brochure that contrast stitching is available but cannot find any reference to the codes given UH, QX and UA, but the choice for the SQ5+ is: black leather with grey stitching diamond pattern only."
"FWIW, the 'standard' interior on the SQ+ looks lovely - the diamond stitched seats and contrast stitching to arm rests etc work a treat.I chose the carbon inlays (IMO much better looking than the aluminium in my earlier SQ) and all contrasts well with the grey (alcantara effect?) door inserts.Finally, there was a mix up on my original order - car should have had the black interior headlining but arrived with silver.Again, IMO, this 'lifts' the light / airiness of the interior, works really well in conjunction with the Pano Roof option, and with the contrast stitching around the rest of the cabin."
Have been usingBilt Hamber Auto-Wheelcleaner for a while and although is does a great job is has a very powerful smell (Purple cleaner I guess) which the wife and -sometimes me- doesn't like. Can anyone recommend an equivalent cleaner that doesn't smell so bad?
Muck Off works well and is a lot cheaper.
I use a product called RED it is made by Autosmart its not cheap £35 +vat for 5 lts but its fantastic no scrubbing required and no smell it also leave a gleaming shine on my high gloss black alloys
"I can recommend -Valet Pro Bilberry Wheel CleanerSmells nice to me anyway, and does a good job.+1 on the Gtechniq wheel sealant."
+1 on Valet pro bilberry wheel cleaner.
Coolmac said:+1 on Valet pro bilberry wheel cleaner.Click to expand...Make that +2
Would be cautious of Bilberry read somewhere it can take the laquer off your alloys.
Regular washing with soap and water but start with a non acid wheel cleaner. I like Merlins blood personally. Then find a product to seal the wheels as suggested by others.I will be applying my first wax coat to my wheels this weekend once I get my delivery from polished bliss

"Can anyone tell me please if you need to activate something in the MMI when on Dab stations to show song/artist when a song is being played. One of my previous Q5 when on a dab stations did this, but on this one its not doing it, i know a station has to transmit what ever it is to allow this to happen and not all do that, but I can't get it to work on any station.Thanks in advance."
Doesn't show that info on my MMI either.
"Well at least I'm not the only one then missile, thanks for the reply. It did on my 11 plate Q5. It came up with the radio show, then when a song played it told you the song title and the artist."
"Same issue for me Bonzoboy. The song used to come up on DAB in my now traded in Evoque, and although I'll miss that feature, it won't be too much of a hardship."
I'd like to know how to do this too...
"Does that mean it'll be May '14, when the weather improves before we find out?"
"You need to press the ""info"" or ""text"" buttons on the MMI from recollection it doesn't come on default which is a tad annoying.Will check tonight."

"Most welcome....was afflicted with a moment of laziness, its passed now..."
"Thank you John, what a great forum and people that use it this is."
Thank you very much. Great work...
"I'm in need of new tyres after 13,000 miles (Pirelli's - say no more) and the tyre suppliers/fitters are telling me I need to replace all four as it is a Quattro and will confuse the TPM system if I replace just the fronts. Is this right? Got a price fully fitted for 4 of just over £800 for Pirelli P Zero XL's which doesn't seem at all bad I reckon. Kwik Fit wanted over £700 for 2 Dunlops and £510 for Pirelli's! The place I'm using has also offered to rotate fronts to back after 6 months to even out the wear on the new set."
"I think there chatting pony, if there's plenty of tread left the other 2 just change wat u need, I paid £760 for 4 dunlops in Maidstone Kent , including fitting , 21"" ????"
"I've been told the same but just ignoring it as I can't see a few mm making anydifference.Mypirellis are down to wear bands on the front but still have 3-4mm on the rears after 17,000 miles so not bad really.Ordered a pair today @£400 fitted."
There's obviously a difference of several mm between front and rear now and I take it you're not having problems with TPMS. So they're definately trying it on.
I've got pirellis and after 13k the fronts are showing more wear than the rears. Assume it's ok for my friendly tyre place to swap front for the rears to help extend the life?
"Go for Goodyear Excellence tyres (if you're keeping the car)Mine came with these tyres from new, and after 17,000 they've hardly worn.When I took it in to Dealership last week, for quick inspection too see about trade-in price, the guy inspecting couldn't believe their condition, and said they could stay on and go on the forecourt as is.They have to change when down to 4mm apparently."
............ got nothing to do with the TPMS but somewhere in the manual it does suggest the quattro system can be damaged if you don't change all 4 at the same time???
That is the party line form Audi. The Quattro system could be damaged if there is a difference in rolling radius of the tyres.
If you have a puncture and put on the unused inflatable spare and the tyre on the same axle opposite has a worn tyre near the legal limit surely this scenario must be similar to changing 1 worn tyre on the same axle.
"Very true, but one would only drive for a short distance at low speed with a space saver spare wheel. More to the point, one could argue that if the front tyres have worn faster than the rears then one already has a difference in rolling radius.Anyway, not an issue I loose sleep over. I changed fronts only on my previous Q5 and replaced a damaged tyre on a.n.other Quattro."
"Wow good reccomendation. Found them for less than £500 for 4 on Asda tyres as wellhttp://www.asdatyres...--excellence-aoMy Bridgestones are due for a change after 13k miles, though that has been 90%+ urban driving."
"Only changed a pair on my Golf R as thought that everything I was told was rubbish and regretted it big time. Car felt like I was driving on ice, just couldn't believe how bad it felt"
So what is the consensus? Ok to change just 2 tyres at a timeorswap front to rear and change all 4 at the same time?What page in the manual suggests the quattro system can be damaged if not changing all 4?
"On page 148, it states ""...... also avoid using tyres with varying tread depths."" and on page 194 ""...... all four wheels must always be fitted with tyres of the same type, make and tread pattern ....."". Not sure if that gives Audi enough wiggle room if quattro is damaged (somehow) and they establish you didn't change all 4 at the same time????Personally, I swap mine front to back (and viccy vercy) when I change from summer to winter and back again."
"I would definitely want similar depth tyres across an axel.not so concerned front to back, so long as they're not too far out.And I would do the front to back swap when I put my summers back on - just need to remember to mark the wheels up :-/"
What do you mean by mark wheels up?Also is it easy to find where to place the trolley jack?
Have you ever used axle stands and if so where did you put them.
On the axle?
Nope - got a 3 ton SWL trolley jack and just do one wheel at a time ............................
"I'm in need of new tyres after 13,000 miles (Pirelli's - say no more) and the tyre suppliers/fitters are telling me I need to replace all four as it is a Quattro and will confuse the TPM system if I replace just the fronts. Is this right? Got a price fully fitted for 4 of just over £800 for Pirelli P Zero XL's which doesn't seem at all bad I reckon. Kwik Fit wanted over £700 for 2 Dunlops and £510 for Pirelli's! The place I'm using has also offered to rotate fronts to back after 6 months to even out the wear on the new set."
"But if you only have the one set of 4 on the car then you have to use an axle stand, unless you have a spare - to move front tyres to the back and vice versa."
So the black thing fits in the jacking point under the car? If so whats it called?Edit* - thinking about it I'm sure my trolley jack has a puck like thing on it already.
"Bought the ""Jacking Pad"" from a similar place in USA. The bottle jack was £11 from B&Q. Got it for my previous Tiguan but will be better for the Q5 as the ground clearance is better. Prefer the bottle jack as its smaller and lighter than Trolley Jack to cart around.http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/VW-Volkswagen-BLACK-JACK-PAD-Adapter-Floor-Jack-pinch-weld-side-lift-jetta-bug-/331762982157?hash=item4d3e9d5d0d:g:9EEAAOSwuMFUd3RR"
"Thanks for the link. I don't cart around the trolley jack though, it weighs a ton!"
Sorry it wasn't a serious answer. I would for what it is worth replace all 4. I did that last summer following an Audi health check.
"Having gone out this morning to swap to summers, I'm now postponing whilst I consider where to jack from.I might buy one of these adapters first: (search ebay for Q5 jack pad adapter) [why can't I paste a link in here????] - it's a black pad with a v cut in the top to go over the sill (sp?) at the jacking point.Unless, anyone can inform me of where they position their trolley jack to best effect, please?"
"didn't take it seriously, struggled to find a solid point under the car."
I use the scissor jack point (with the trolley jack adapter). How much are the trolley jack adapters? I only ask 'cos you can buy one for about £1.50 from Amazon; all you need to do is cut a v-shaped slot in the top with a hacksaw before use.
i changed my tyres 2 at a time twice over 2 years on my old Q5 and never had a problem.
Correct jacking point with a trolley jack is the reinforced section of the inner sill here you mount the scissors jack supplied with the car. If unsure you can locate it by looking for the triangular indent mark on the outer sill of all VAG vehicles
"I had mine detailed before collection and was completed in a day, this will depend on how bad the paintwork is of course. See my sig below. I have just had a refresh done to remove any contaminates that had bound to the paint work and this has brought back the coating to as new."
"I had my new SQ5 detailed straight after collection using gtechniq light serum. All transit marks, slight scratches and swirls were machine polished out prior to the serum being applied. The 5 year guarantee stipulates the vehicle is inspected every year to look for deterioration. I don't expect it to increase the residual value, what I did want is a better prepared new car paintwork which the dealers valeters could not match."
Thanks guys I may well do this myself then rather than spending £900 on getting the full treatment.Probably cost me £300 to buy all the bits and I can do it every 6 months myself.
"Did not cost me anywhere near £900, it was a full new car detail and had the new crystal serum and exo v2 over the top. The inside was also treated.Jonny @puredetail did say the paintwork was very good and so did not need a lot of polishing.I recently had to have a new bumper due to a faulty headlight washer and had this coated with a minor polish."
"missile said:I have four questionsMy comments >1. How many of you opted for the Autoglym product with Audi or have had something done aftermarket as such?Not me2. Does it improve the re-sale value by much?No3. Is it better to just have standard protection details done every 18 months rather than this advanced 5 year product?I doubt any product will last 5 years.4. I look after m cars and wash them etc every weekend with all the recommended products and processes so then is it really needed?If you enjoy DIY - then professional detailing is a waste of money.Any general opinions and feedback appreciated.I went on a visit to a professional detailer with Quattro owners club and gained very useful knowledge on how to DIY.You can see how to videos on YouTube, get advice and buy all you need with free delivery herehttp://www.polishedbliss.co.uk/Click to expand...brilliant advice Missile - i concur with all of that."
"Mine had the treatment by Audi when it was new last July.I'd have to say that it looks like it's been polished after a normal wash,so I'm pretty pleased.I did not pay for the treatment, and would not normally specify it on a new car - but might do next time as it seems pretty good."
Audi year split into quarters so they are probably trying to meet their R8 sales quota before the end of Q1.
"As do all publicly traded companies however it depends if their financial year run's with the calendar year, i.e. HP's end of year is October.MT"
"Yes I've heard a lot of people being made redundant there, were you with the EDS arm by any chance?MT"
"No was never there, I work for EMC. I know a few that have worked for HP (not the EDS side of things) but obviously news travels!MT"
I've gone contracting now - so maybe that SQ5 will be feasible on my next upgrade!
"Hi,I was wondering of anyone uses diesel additives like Red-ex on their Q5 and does it really work or is it just a waste of money?One of my friends swears by it for winder driving in Scotland but having never used it I do not have an opinion."
"Diesel additives are used before due to poor quality diesel and problems in the winter, now is the fuel much better and you do not need additivesFor me it was a waste of money"
"Thanks Spijun,I will defer to your expert knowledge!Ronan"
"not exactly correct ...all depends were you buy your fuel from, quality various alot. Buy it from fuel specialists like shell etc NOT supermarkets."
well some call it fuel
"Cruiser, if I am using Tesco or Sainsburys Fuel which i think may be esso (based on the tanker that was filling the tanks in the Tesco petrol station) so i use something like redex every few tanks?I am asking this as my wife sometimes borrows my car and sometimes fills it up at Tesco.your advice would be appreciated"
Thanks guys!I usually use the Shell garage in corstorphine but MRS uses Tesco and Sainsburys for her Polo and has put Tesco diesel in my car recently so will stick to Shell as it is actually nearer to my house!
"podgas said:Diesel Fuel come from the same refinery from the same storage tank for all brands.The only thing thats differant are the following.Tanker Driver swipes his card when he starts to fill up this puts the additive pack in the fuel if it has one.The only differant diesel is Shell V-Power as it has a high GTL mix [Gas to Liquid] so that part is not made from Oil and it has the lowest Soot contant of any Diesel.Forget Power claims I just stick this in our Diesel Cars and have no issues with DPF Clogging even if driven in Town at low speed for weeks.Just put V-Power Diesel in your Tank.Click to expand...That's V-Power DIESEL, not V-Power Unleaded, in case anyone makes that mistake. Unleaded petrol in VAG Common Rail 'CR' diesel engines is an engine killer! You can get away with it in the PD engines, but not the CR engines"
Misfuelling inhibition for diesel currant models on mine as Standard so no Unleaded may enter.
had a few vehicles in the workshop with misfuelling inhibition and youd be surprised what people can do ...they thought the pump was faulty
Best one was a few years ago on the M5 services.Tanker Driver filled Diesel tank with Petrol cars filled up back on motorway in a Flash up to 70+BANG and lots of them.
"I live in the Chicagoland area and have always had issues when it came to picking/finding a station that sells good quality diesel fuel. During my research i went into several stations and asked them what type of fuel they have. I typically heard B10 or >B10 which could be crap. I have found that the ""Delta Sonic"" and ""Meijer"" are the only stations that call out B5 or better on their pumps and their employees are fully aware that they carry a good quality diesel fuel. Meijer happens to be a supermarket."
My insurance company insist I have a cat 5 tracker fitted to my new SQ5 the best deal I can find is £650 plus £200 per year subscription can anyone beat thischeers LB
"The insurance company is not charging me, the price I quoted was from tracker themselves to install a cat 5 tracker to my new SQ5 plus the insurance company just said it was a requirement I had one due to value etc I am trying to find a better deal on getting it fitted than tracker have quoted"
"Lanerboy,Do you mean the tracker is £650 ?If so what is the insurance cost ?I have had a quote (SQ5) £317 for Comprehensive."
"yes the tracker is £650 plus £200 per year for subscription, regards insurer I don't want to change as I am on a motor traders policy which covers all my vehicles my employees the property etc etc but there is a clause in it saying any vehicle I own with a value exceeding 40k must have a cat 5 tracker fitted to it so just trying to get the tracker down in cost not the insuranceInsurance cost is around 5k per year but this is a good price for what cover I have for my company and the employees, the building, customer vehicles, public liability, SDP and business use, money on the premises and so on and so on"
"Hi,We recommend the below. Maybe they can help out.http://gapsecuritydirect.co.uk/Regards,Dan."
"Change broker, a tracker shouldn't be needed at all for the SQ5."
"Hi,Unfortunately in this day and age a number of insurers will require a tracking system for desirable 4x4s like the Audi SQ5 I'm afraid.Regards,Dan."
Never had an issue with needing a tracker for the SQ5.
Just insured my SQ with DirectLine - no tracker required.
I've been with 3 different companies and never needed one.
LV= don't require one for the SQ5 (but they do for an A6 Allroad)...............
"My o/p was not about my insurance company it was about the tracker as stated above moving insurance companies is not an option as i get a great deal from who i am with if i moved it would cost me another 2k as its not an ordinary policy its a motor traders policy and covers my premises, all my employees, customers vehicles, all my other vehicles, money on premises, money traveling to the bank, public liability, all the tools etc etc etc"
"Heavy negotiating but SQ5 + VW Golf Cabrio - Admiral Multicar - £420 for both vehicles fully comp...renewed last week + no trackers required.Policy is like-for-like in terms of legal cover, voluntary excesses etc. Based on 2 drivers, social, domestic and commuting cover, each having 10 + years NCD + no penalty points.Had been with Hastings Direct for the previous 2 years and invited them to price match on a £40 differential, but they decided not to.Admiral got my business."
Interested in the comment by MrH about LV. I'm with them too and they informed me that I would still be insured but not covered for theft without a tracker fitted! I got the dealer to supply and fit the Cobra (now Vodafone)/Audi tracker as part of the deal when I bought my SQ5. Personally if it gets stolen I don't want it back once some theiving scroat has been in it and would rather have the payment and the gap top up.
"Interesting that; certainly they stated a tracker not required when I asked. Are you a ""direct"" customer with LV or have you used them via CSMA (not that that should make a difference)?"
So why not just insure the SQ5 under a seperate policy. One that doesnt require a tracker to be fitted?
I did think about doing that but after all the hype regards Land Rover Jaguar and Audi vehicles being stolen very easily with the push button start system i am going to go the class 5 tracker way this will give me piece of mind and the vehicle can be turned off at any point via the call centre if it ever was stolen
My insurance company insist I have a cat 5 tracker fitted to my new SQ5 the best deal I can find is £650 plus £200 per year subscription can anyone beat thischeers LB
So if it get nicked you want it back? When some chav has been at the wheel.
was told today by another insurance company i can only use my full no claims discount on one insurance policy so this would mean the premium would be sky high if i insured the SQ5 on its own policy does anyone know if this is right ?????
I would suggest you speak with a broker like our sponsor Adrian Flux
I have had several quotes today on a separate policy to insure just the SQ5 and I have 2 problems1 I can only use my no claims on 1 policy so I need to use it on my traders policy2 Other insurance companies will not take my no claims into account as I have been on a traders policy for the last 18 years and they will only take ncb into account if earned through a private policy not a company policy
"Doesn't sound right. I came out of a company car after 12+ years and my insurer accepted without question the ""NCB"" gained using my employer's insurance; the same applied for my wife who had a company car for 20+ years and then went private.............."
"+1For what it's worth:If you've been a named driver on a spouse's policy and have maintained a decent joint claim-free record, many insurers will provide a letter on request which is often (but not always) sufficient for that 'named' driver to then start his / her own new policy with NCB attached.Ironically, original steer on this came from Volkswagen Audi Group themselves, whilst reviewing the freebie 7 day insurance they provide with a new vehicle."
"Just tell them you will take all of your business elsewhere, sounds like you are one of their more valuable customers and won't want to loose you."
"yes I have told them exactly that, told them if they don't sort it I will not renew with them in Nov I have been with them for 12 years and never made a claim, they better sort this for free or they will loose best part of 4k in NovI am sick of just lying down and taking it up the a$$ of these sort of companies I have had enough"
Well had a call today from Axa saying they WILL NOT insure the SQ5 without a tracker they have down graded it to a tracker locate but thats as much as they will do for me even though i have told them they will loose my business of 12 years in Nov they say tracker or no insurance !!!!!!I have now put in a formal complaint regards the service they have offered me
Wow sorry to hear that.There is no customer service now !Most of us put up with bad service but eventually we ALL need to stand up & say NO MORE !!Try another insurer for your business & explain the difficulties & see if they want your business.Keep your chin up Lanerboy !
well finally got the result I was after Axa have agreed to insure my SQ5 plus WITHOUT a tracker woo hoo I was all ready to cancel my insurance in the end but they came good right at the bitter end so I went from cat 5 tracker to tracker locate to no tracker so a good result in my eyes
my insurance was going to go up if i enabled my tracker ??? go figure
"With days to go before spec is set in concrete Iam having doubts about the colour. Again !!!Principally because I have not seen a SQ5 plus in lava grey. Never fussed over a car colour before, but with the glossy black wing mirrors on the plus rather than the sleek silver ones on the SQ5 I think the extended pack will be lost.Does anyone have any images side/front images of a the SQ5 plus with this colour combo.I've seen one or two lava grey SQ5 and all are silver grills which is not an option on plus.Maybe I'll be bottling it back to glacier white as we have now as I know black pack will stand out and be seen.Decisions ......."
White with Black detailing = the photographic equivalent of a negative. Go for Black with Black.
"My wife had two black RS Turbos, forever looked dirty and showed marks to much.Black is too Knightsbridge gangster for my Somerst life and Scooby blue has ""nick"" me written all over it.Really wantMonsoon looks the closesthttp://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/28210-sq5-plus-monsoon-collection"
White with Black Pack looks fantastic. My current white M4 with the black carbon roof looks so good. The best contrast of colours........surely.
"Glacier white, with chrome OR the black pack looks special.Personal taste of course, but why anyone would buy a £50k 'Sport SUV' in dull grey, is beyond me, but Hey, that's why there's a colour choice, to cater for all tastes."
"I've had a Daytona/Black Q5 and a Panther/Chrome SQ. The SQ looked far better. Black doesn't work on dark colours imo, particularly lava/daytona/mythos and panther, and particularly on the Q5 for some reason. It somehow softens the front and loses definition.I would never think of ordering a white car, but conversely think that the SQ in white with black optics and black 21's looks amazing.Clearly personal taste though, but since you ask for opinions...."
"black, white, 50 shades of grey.... yawn!"
Yeah..........I tend to agree very much with this opinion too!!
"C'mon now, there is nowt wrong with opinion. This is especially ironic from the owner of a tangerine SUV!! Barf!!Just opinion remember..........don't bite back please."
And white is a premium colour?!
I'm not sure that question warrants an answer. A white Bentley or a metallic black Kia.........which one is a premium colour? I can't answer that.
Lets consider a white Kia or Black Bentley? Manufacturer shouldnt have a bearing on whether a colour is premium or not
Agreed. I think you now see my point. Let's drop this now.
So quite how you can concur that white is a premium colour over a dull grey is rather absurd.Colour is person dependant but white certainly doesnt make a vehicle anymore premium over any other colour.Plus you may notice lava grey is a pearlescent paint as is Sepang. White comes at best in metallic.
Production fixed for wk 14 !It's Lava Grey; too late to changeI would have gone Monsson or white or red in that order
SQ5 booked in next week for oil and filter change. Dealer quotes varied widely. Best I could get was 2p short of £230 - for 6.5 litres of oil a filter and a sump plug washer. Would have taken it to my independent Audi technian but we all know what Audi are like for ducking out of their warranty if you take it out of the dealer network in the first 3 years and then encounter a problem requiring warranty work. Yes i appreciate its a premium brand but charging prices like these is taking liberties.
"What! Outrageous. Write a complaint on their facebook page and copy the link here.(Also, try buying your own oil and then see what they charge)"
"Oil and filter only, or an interim service? I would be interested to know how much you think you could have saved going to an independent?"
"It's just the oil change only as per the display on the MMI. I don't need an interim service for 10,000 miles. An interim service will, I imagine, be at least double the cost of the oil change!"
You want to find another dealer.
I'm up in Yorkshire and the price was the best of 3 dealers. Would be interesting to see what quotes you guys achieve ( just call your local dealer and ask them how much they charge for an oil change on a SQ5) and podt your results here? I made sure when calling that this was not an interim service I was asking them to quote for.
"Not sure how many miles you have covered but if less than 19,000 then probably oil change not necessary yet. You can reset the oil change due flag through your MMI just select through the Service details and you have an option to 'Reset Oil Change' it probably wasn't set up for variable in the first place."
"dealer told me my new SQ5 was 18k service intervals I took out a service plan that covers me for 36k over 3 years and includes the 1st 2 services and I paid £650 for this not sure if I was robbed or not but on a car of this value I personally think you need Audi history when you come to sell it, what you might save buy using a none Audi garage you will loose when you come to sell it."
"My SQ5 is three years old next month. Had one interim service..I agree with Lanerboy, an Audi full service history is worth paying for."
"I'd say, forget the un-necessary, 9,000 mile/12 month 'interim oil change'Just get the combined 19,000 mile/ 2 year, everything included full service, for about £100 more."
They will price match a local independent if you ask them.https://m.audi.co.uk/owners-area/servicing-with-audi/service-price-match.html
and if your Q5 is 3+ years old they have fixed price servicing.

"Could be fun, there are so many idiots on the road you could start a youtube channel! Not looked into this, I would like a good radar detector though!"
No point with radar / laser detectors Kramer by the time they pick up the signal it's too late. Better with a GPS based system with a regular database system. Now a garage door opener that's accidentally on the same frequency as a laser gun would be interesting...Also highly debatably legal / illegal!
I have also considered getting an in car cam following being cut up by a complete idiot.

I like the idea of having a cam recording what happens but I don't like idea of having power supply cables draped over the front of the car.Do these things sit on the dashboard or do they hang from the rear view mirror?
These usually fit behind rear view mirror. They can be hard wired in as I agree with you about wires hanging across screen.
After just spending the last 30 minutes on YouTube this thing has gone from a toy to play with to essential protection!It's now gone from do I want one to which one do I buy!Unfortunately there seems to be a zillion options and most of the YouTube clips are American.

Some have been able to hard wire to the courtesery light.
"I have the GoPro silver edition, works great"
GPS will be essential if you ever needed to use in a court action. With this you will be able to give accurate evidence of any incident place time etc.As for in use whilst park both blackview and mi witness offer this but beware as you will need to include a smart power lead so as not to drain car battery. As well as HD make sure night use is of a good quality or else will only be useful during daylight hours.
"Apparently the mi witness is only 720p and not 1080p. So what? I have been advised that 1080p is meeded to stand the best chance of getting the reg no,"
Your money = your choice. Using 1080 will slow down fops and eat up massive amounts of storage.Like on a standard camera more pixels do not mean better quality. Other factors such as depth of field and aperture opening will have a large effect on picture clarity.

I've done my research and I've made my choice. I've gone for the ITRONICS ITB-100HD. I quickly wrote off the BlackVue which got bad reviews (albeit a lot of them down to overheating which is not the biggest problem in the UK!) I was dithering on a LUKAS but then the below company (of good repute) dropped their prices on the Itronic so that tipped me off the fence and it's on its way - I'll report back when it's up and running (I've ordered the upc so I may need a little help with the wiring).http://forum.dashcam...c.php?f=5&t=972http://apple-ct.com/...p?id_product=44

"Update . . .Having had this cam now for 2 years I wouldNEVERhave a car without one.I will make a prediction . . I am sure that very soon these cams will be an optional extra and then a standard fitting like any other. I forget about it for most of the time and then something happens, a near miss or something and I know it's all caught on the cam. We went on holiday recently leaving the car in one of those off airport car parks. I came home, plugged the SD card into the compute and I saw and heard everything, every time anyone touched my car. FABULOUS"
There are several unused fuses. If you test you will find some of those are live / suitable to use. I would use one of those in preference to piggy backing onto an existing fuse.
That looks a very neat install and exactly where I will locate mine when I get one. I'm glad to hear that the shaded area doesn't unduly effect the picture quality.I'm undecided about hard wiring it until my warranty runs out next year. I want to be able to uses the outlet in the armrest rather than the ashtray so I will probably need to buy an extension lead as I expect the distance will be more than the usual 3m leads supplied.... I'm must get round to measuring my planned route before I decide.Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"Installation:After sorting out which fuse to attach which wire to I was quite surprised out how easy it was to install. I thought that I would have to take out all the panelling to get the wire from the cam to the fuse box but it simply tucked into the gap between the panelling and the window. I then adhered the female socket for the jack plug to the underside of the glove compartment with double sided tape. This gives me the option to unplug it at will. Why would I need to unplug it? Because if I had a bump I'd want to take out the SD card less it was overwritten and with this particular cam, if you take it out whilst it is still live it bleeps intermittently."

Anyone notice that there is a Blackvue DR650GW 2CH IR (infra red) version now available? So that the rear camera can be used as a interior camera. But it doesn't really mention if it can also be used as a rear facing camera to?Also supports 128gb card and some cloud service.
"Hi Guys and Girls, a follow-up to my Dashcam installation, it has been working now for about 6-8 weeks and things are really good. Haven't yet had reason to see any replays of the software, but a few close shaves in the main with white vans , you know what I mean.If anyone would like details of the Guy who fitted then please get in touch, am more than happy to pass-on his info."
"i fitted My old BlackVue to my new Q5 yesterday - i moved it to the right of centre (from where my camera was on my previous Q5) so it is now in line with my eyes and it sees more or less exactly what i see from the drivers seat, as there was a constant 'black spot' created by the High-Beam-Assist camera.took me about 10 minutes to fit with hardly any cable visible at any point. works a treat.it just did not feel right driving without a camera! although i need to upgrade so i get the rear of the car covered."
there is another name for Interior Camera's in cars - they are calledDeath Cams.i wouldn't ever put one in my car - all that would be seen if it came to it would be myself or friends or loved ones suffering or being killed in an accident.i only want the exterior of my car and the area around it to be seen.having seen the last moments of some of these Death Cams - it is very grim indeed.
No you use it as a rear facing camera and then when you park overnight you turn it to point inside and if someone breaks into your car you have them on camera. Other reason is for taxis.
i don't think in all honesty anyone would never remember to turn it back to face outwards everyday and end you would end up with a Death Cam anyhow.
"Could anyone please tell me what is left under the boot space when the collapsible spare wheel is not supplied? Are the plastic insert and fixing nut still in there and just the wheel is missing? I am changing my Q5, my current one has the collapsible wheel which I extend to keep, but not sure what else I might need to remove, or is it just the wheel I need to keep?"
IIRC you get the sub-woofer which is held in place by the same plastic spigot and nut i.e. just the wheel missing as you suggest................
Many thanks MrH
"Just wondered why did you buy the SQ5Me personally well I went to buy a 2.0tdi s line plus model from the dealer so we looked around it then went out for a spin and yes I thought it was a very nice car but I personally thought it lacked the umph that my 3,0 lts disco and my wifes Bmw has. I told the salesman this and he said well have a look at the SQ5 ??????I then began to tell him I didn't want to have the same £500 per year road tax and 21mpg that my 3ltr disco has and he told me that the SQ5 is nothing like so I agreed to test drive one and wow as soon as I drove it I thought I have got to have one of these the performance was incredible compared to my disco and the 2.0 ltr model I went to buySo now I have a SQ5 Plus on order and it was all down to the salesman telling me to JUST TRY IT lol so why did you buy a SQ5"
"For me it was an upgrade from a 2litre d Q5, they weren't on the road when I ordered,I test drove an A4 I think with the same engine, and was well impressed with speed and economy,I would have preferred at bit more of a difference looking wise compared to other Q5s,but I've modded mine now so happy ,I think that new black pack option is great value ????"
I did not
Wife liked the colour and 2 tone seats...
"Had a Q5 2010 170 which I was going to replace with an S-Line 3.0 as we had a caravan and I wanted more oomph, though the 170 was more than enough to pull the caravan...but I wanted more!Anyhow, went to the stealership to look at 3.0 earlier this year and ended up test driving then buying an SQ5, fully specs 'do in Sepang Blue and what an awesome car!Btw...took the caravan out 2 days after collecting the SQ5...what caravan!! ????????"
"i did NOT buy an SQ5 because i couldn't afford one!if i win the Lottery - it will me mine, oh yes, it will be mine.honestly - i'd love one. maybe some day.in the meantime, i admire and envy all of you SQ5 drivers - have fun."
"I just bought a 3.0 TDi SE Q5 a few years old, I bought it due to my Mum passing away and the likelihood of having to ferry my Dad around. it's a really well specced model, and has the bench seat plus, which was key to accommodating 3 adults. I did look at Q7s, but they were too barge like. I'd love an SQ5, but the only way I could own an SQ5 is to part finance, but I don't like finance on my vehicles, so I'm happy to stick with this one for now. It is now on approx 99k miles and still runs like a dream. As my mileage of up to 40k a year would kill any PCP or hire purchase contract agreement. According to a Merc dealer I went to when I had to sell my late mothers Merc is 75% of all cars have finance on them - this genuinely surprised me."
"Why? PCP is the Automotive industry way to get people into a car they wouldn't normally be able to afford.You have no capital payments, just depreciation and finance cost."
what is PCP never heard of it

"Initially I bought a new 3.0TDI S Line and loved it.When it came time to change I upgraded to a new SQ5 and when this one was ready to change I could not find another car that ticked all the boxes like the SQ does, so I bought another one last September. This one has a few more goodies including the 21"" wheels and cross stitch seats (which absolutely makes the interior special). I was close to changing for the Macan but I think all round the SQ is better value for a daily driver."

"My last Sq5 'drowned' during Storm Frank in BALLATER on 30 December 2015. I loved the car and just had to replace it. It is supposed to be built in Week 8 for delivery in March. Apart from the Plus version I have added the B&O sound system and Audi drive select.I feel with 21"" wheels winter tyres will be a must.My user name was previously just ZED. I am now back - hence ZEDBACK.Last one was Estoril blue.Any one ordering for the first time, will not be disappointed."
When you say 'drowned' what happened?
"I drove into the River Dee flowing in the opposite direction to which I was driving. It had broken its banks. Struggled to get out of car due to pressure of water. Built in safety feature lowered the Windows which neutralised the pressure. When I got out the water level was just below waist deep. The car just shut down in every respect.Car was written off with just 22,000 miles on the clock.An experience not to be repeated! Scary, or what?"
"Thanks for the welcome!I shall look forward to participating in the forum.Looking forward to the new wheels. Speaking of which, I have just ordered a set of alloys with winter tyres. These are going straight into storage. Could not find s propeller on the option list í ½í¸Kind regards to old and new friends on this forum,ZED"
Definitely scary.
"Yes, how did you know? It is amazing how many people have spotted it, including my Audi salesman, who was last seen rubbing his hands!!!!ZED"
"I just put two and two together flooding,Ballater and blue SQ5."
Saw this photo the day it was posted but assumed it was a visitor who had parked their SQ5 in the street before the water came through the village as had never seen the car in Ballater before. Never thought to ask if anyone knew how it got there.Decision to get winters definitely the right one. Have had a a couple of interesting journeys back from the south over the Cairnwell late at night in last few weeks which would have been very challenging on summer rubber.Should be easy to spot your new one as do not think there are many Sepang Qs west of Banchory.
yep - had a peage tag for a few years now - makes a big difference (although I managed to avoid peage altogether on this trip)
I am doing this trip early April cant wait to do it in my new SQ5 will get theT 'peage' tag you mention to save looking for change etc how does this work regards payment do you have to be in credit with it or does it debit your bank for what ever roads you use
"i'm off to the three valleys at easter too. anyone got a set of chains to fit 21 inch wheels that they want to sell cheap/rent to me? i don't fancy the £380 for the Thules ones as i'm unlikely to need them at end of march, first week in april......"
"Are you using winter tyres for your trip, I am but will I still need chains ??????"
"@lanerboy - not been able to find any winter tyres that are not crazy prices. 255/40/R21 seems to be an odd size. i tried Audi to see how much some 19""s would be, with the thought i'd keep 2 sets of wheels, 19's with winters and the 21's for summer. but audi quoted £2000 for that, so that was a no go too!"
"Shop around on eBay etc. I got virtually new tyres for 300 and new genuine Audi 20"" wheels for 825. Nearer Spring you might do better.If you will be driving on ice or snow at the resort, or it's below 7c or wet or snowing on the motorways, it's much safer to use winter rubber. Chains are then only needed if you get deep snow falls."

"Hi,Haven't used my chains since becoming a winter tyre convert, dumping it down in the Alps a couple of weeks ago, a few cars off the road coming downhill, cars either crawling or stopped fitting chains going up on a cold dark night, no problem for the SQ on winters - startling traction for a relaxed cosy drive.With lots of snow and no winter tyres all you have is a 2 tonne sledge - AWD isn't much good down hill!"
"I'm sure that chains are not essential in Germany. I've been going for years in winter in my own car and airport rentals. I have only used chains on 2 rental cars I had with summer tyres. Having said that, chains would most definitely be advisable if you knew that there was a chance of a big dump whilst you are there.BTW, I was having a quick recce at the Channel Tunnel carpark in Folkestone whilst waiting for my train and was surprised how few cars had winter tyres, including the ones that looked like they might be heading for the mountains (long thin roof boxes etc - of course this may mean nothing)"
"Barbyboy said:A comprehensive list - cheers Neebsta.I'd perhaps take issue with stated French requirements as 'rules' are invariably interpreted and applied differently. (As Churchill said, a country that produces over 100 different types of cheese is simply ungovernable).IMO, it all depends on a) where you are andwho's enforcing them at the time - be it National Gendarmes or local ASVP bods (akin to our traffic wardens).ASVP's can be especially officious and difficult - particularly with Brit cars funnily enough - and it's these chaps you're most likely to meet close to or in resort.A cursory look at your car and they'll decide whether you go on your merry way or not. A smile, 4WD and winter tyres seems to do the trick as we've been stopped many times but have never carried or been ordered to fit chains.Click to expand...Autosocks are accepted as a substitute in France on the proviso you print something out and stick it on the bag.

"I was shocked to have summer tyres on a rental car from AVIS at Munich airport 12 years ago (Audi a4 avant 2wd) There was a dump of snow on that occasion and I had to borrow chains from the owner of the apartment I stayed at because I could not get up the hill to the ski lift car park. But the worse think was the return to the airport after another dump of snow as I had to give the chains back and just go for it on the summer tyres. Never been so scared as when I had to join the motorway by trying to accelerate the car up to the prevailing speed of the heavy motorway traffic on the slip road when the motorway had 10 cm of snow on it apart from tyre channels in each lane, and all the traffic was just driving as per normal."

"MrZapie said:AustriaWinter tyres are mandatory in Austria. The law states that passenger cars with a permissible maximum weight of up to 3.5 tonnes may be operated only between 1 November and 15 April in winter conditions such as snow, slush or ice if winter tyres have been installed on all wheels. All-season tyres are also considered winter tyres if they have the ""M + S"" mark.As an alternative to winter tyres, snow chains may be used on at least two driving wheels, however, these may only be used in case the road is covered by a complete or scarcely broken snow cover or sheet of ice. Failure to comply with the law results in a fine up to 5,000 Euros and the vehicle could be impounded. Insurance is deemed void if a vehicle which is involved in an accident between November 1 and April 15 is not fitted with winter tyres.Click to expand...I'm pretty sure 'Winter Tyres' and 'Mandatory' between '1/11 and 15/4' means exactly that. They are mandatory during that period. Last part - insurance is deemed invalid for any vehicle involved in an accident between 1/11 and the 15/4 that is not fitted with winter tyres.It's not, in my opinion suggesting summer tyres and chains can be used in lieu of winter tyres, far from it in fact."
Go onto German eBay and get a full set of OEM Q5 winter alloys and tyres. I got a full set for about £350 delivered with nearly new Dunlop Winter Sports Tyres.
"When I was in Vienna with Austrian colleagues recently, they said the same. Winter tyres are mandatory from O to A. And your insurance won't pay out if you have an accident on summer tyres"

"Have finally taken delivery of my SQ5, loving it so far but petrified of kerbs!What's people's thoughts on tyre and alloy insurance? Anyone taken the dealers offering (seems steep to me) or taken it out through another insurer?I didn't bother with my last A5, had 1 nail in tyre incident in 3 years and plenty of kerb damage to the rotor alloys which I never fixed.The 21 Inch Alloys and the rather pricey tyres are making me wonder if it is worthwhile, thoughts?"
Switch to 20's and you will worry less.
"Had a puncture 2M into ownership, which cost more to replace, than 3Y of insurance premium. Now got to take it in to fix some gutter rush, courtesy of the misses. Quids in, and another 1.5Y of cover left."
"Hi,Please feel free to give us a try for tyre insurance if you like. If you would like any further information please feel freee to drop me a line.Regards,Dan."
"Hi, I had it on my first Q5, and beloved wiped an alloy against a high kerb. Paid for itself right there. So I took it out on this one...just in case.J"
Thanks JanAre the details I quoted correct ?
"Yes, I paid £149 but I had standard 5 spoke alloys. Got prettier ones now..!"
Looks very good value - i am sure my local dealer was quoting more than this.
"£149 and 18 claims? Seems too good to be true as you're looking at least a £50 smart repair for a small kerb repair, not even mentioning diamond cut wheels.My other half is reverse parking multiple times a day, if I was offered this insurance at that price I would have taken their arm off, 6 months in and 2 wheels have been done already."

"Oooooh, that sounds handy! That is where I have ordered mine from. Was that price for 21"" SQ5 wheels and tyres??"
Are you asking me about gap or wheel insurance ????
"I got the alloy protection thrown in for free, along with autoglym, rubber mats and boot mat , all on top of the 11% discount.That new version Q5 is obviously not very far off !!"
"Wheel insurance, sorry."
"Ah I thought so, Ok I took out the wheel insurance with the dealer it covers my 21 inch diamond cut wheels and I paid £221 for 3 years cover with a maximum of 18 claims in that time with £100 limit per wheel per claimHope this helps"
"£4,500 below new, seems like a reasonable deal for a new motor."
The deals are there to be had. I managed to get 12% in the end (sorry to do the one-upmanship thing) for my ordered SQ5 (from around £52k to around £46k so I was happy with that. I wasn't happy with my local dealer's discount so I shopped around with a generic email to numerous dealerships bluntly stating what I wanted and what I expected in terms of discount. It's a numbers game (if you pardon the pun) and there will (almost) always be a sales person or dealership who want/need to meet targets and are 'willing' to offer a vehicle with little to no margin profit for them. Go bold......be brave.......and never rush (the deal).
"Done the same on my BMW 435d cab, put out there that I wanted 15% , said I wasn't in any rush and would purchase if that deal can be done , and sure enough with a bit of to and throwing , bingo I got it , £10800 off list price ????????????"
"Yeh I could have maybe acheived a bit more from a broker, or waited until new version IS announced and maybe further discount there, but I figured that every month I wait, my 2 yr old gets closer to 3 yr old and probably start dropping like a stone as it nears end of warranty.Plus I like buying from the same dealership which is a 10 min drive from my place.No complaints, I'm happy with the deal"
And being happy with the deal is the important thing. It may not be as 'good' as others' but if you walk away feeling chuffed then it's a GREAT deal.
well done.did the same when I bought my Honda 5 years ago - makes the depreciation workable!
"Yep,And who knows how the depreciation will go when the new model comes out.Dont know if it's had any effect on the old-style Q7's as yet?"
"check DTD. Last time I looked, Q7s were getting hefty discounts too (the new model)!But, I think this is because it's (plain) looks have not been well received, even though it's lots better than the original model.What we need is a very desirable new Q5, because that helps the used values of this generation"
desirable or undesirable???
"Hi all,Looking for some opinions please. I have recently ordered an SQ5 plus currently spec'd with Mythos. But have had a few black cars before and am starting to wobble on the colour.What other colours will suit the black pack fitted as standard?As much as I like it, I'd prefer not to go white, as we'd then have 2 white cars on the drive. ????Thinking Silver, but very few pictures of The plus models around. Only the launch blue colour everywhere. Usually love Grey, but only Monsoon available ( no Daytona - 2k premium)Opinions would be appreciated.Thanks."
"I have recently delivered two Moonlight Blue A6s and thought about what an SQ5 in that colour would be like.When passing Peterborough Audi this week I noticed they have one with the black pack and it looks really good.I am now looking out for an SQ5 Plus in Moonlight to see how the black of the rear spoiler, door handles etc suit the vehicle."
"White is the obvious choice to fully compliment the Black Styling Pack however, as you can't handle the embarrassment of having two white cars on your drive(???????) then I would say that only the launch blue colour compliments it. None of the others are that great and, unless you are looking closely, you probably couldn't really see THAT much of a difference."
"Well I have a seeping blue one on the way which I really like.... however there is a Monsoon one on the forum just picked up that looks fantastic! I hope I don't get fed up with blue as the black bits are very in your face and on the Monsoon they are there but very discreet which I really like.... Don't like white personally very Essex boy racer! Blacks good but a bugger to keep clean, I have had 2 sliver BMWs for last 8 years so a change of colour needed but there is a nice silver Q5 just picked up not an SQ but sill looks nice...."
I think the only body colour that makes any sense when you have black pack detailing is............Blackas the whole point of black detailing is that it should remain understated and stealth-like so go for either Panther or Mythos. If you need further convincing take a look at the RS4 with black-pack which looks great in black but struggles to convince you that its special in any other colour.
Get rid of the black back and the problem is solved.It really cheapens the look of the car.
"Can't get a plus without black pack.Audi showcased the plus with 100 ltd ed Macaw blue (similar to sepang), guessing they thought that was the best colour?Beauty is in the eye of the beholder mind you, stick with your gut, they all look pretty good after all."
"Since you absolutely have to have the black packThere is a really nice looking Monsoon on the forum, also mythos or Panther are obvious choices. Then you really have to tweak the rear drls to be on all the time with black on black"
"I guess its more that two white cars parked next to each other from different manufacturers, I seem to find myself comparing the two shades and automatically preferring one white more than the other. One always seems to appear more cream? Perhaps it's just me?!"
"Hi to you all , I posted on here the other day regards GAP , I get my baby on 4/4/15 so was in Stratford Audi yesterday and was told on April 1st there will be a massive reduction of this from Audi the guy reckons around £300 for 3 yrs cover !!!!! I also asked about there SMART cover and was told this to was being reduced to around £250 / £300 for 3 yrs cover to these have now surely got to be good value at long last from Audi BUT will have to see how much they actually are when I pick her up .Cheers Dave"
"Buying GAP from the dealership still wont solve the problem of the ""GAP"" between invoice value (that you paid) and the true cost of replacement, particularly relevant since the Q5 will be replaced in the next couple of years and both the price will rise and you are unlikely to be able to get the same discount that you have presumably just got on the car you have purchased now.You really want Vehicle replacement GAP insurance that you wont get from a dealer. I think that the underwriters Enterprise and Aegeas both offer replacement GAP but you would need to check to be sure. Car2cover, Frank Pickles spring to mind as brokers for such policies I think."
Thanks for advice I have E Mailed dealer the question re replacement vehicle . Will keep you updatedDave
Replacement GAP is indeed superior to Invoice GAP. It continues to baffle me why Motor Dealers don't (with few exceptions) offer Replacement GAP insurance. £300 for three years Invoice GAP sounds expensive - what is the invoice value of your car?
"Ah Stratford Audi, my friends - I've bought loads of cars from them, decent people."
April the 1st...I ordered a TTQS from them many years ago when i worked at IBM.
"IBM? Its Better Manually?That site is a shadow of its former glory with Telent there and a Premier Inn, nothing stays the same for ever..."
"Check out some comparison sites before you go back. As stated the second (Frank Pickles is good if you want more than £25K GAP). All do full vehicle replacement (so if you bought a new car, you get enough GAP to buy another new car of the insured model at the current new price, up to 5yrs later..https://gapinsurance...CFTLMtAoda1IAYAhttp://www.gapinsura...p-insurance.asp"
"Hi,Just to let you know that we offer a product called Total Loss Protection. Whilst it's not exactly the same as a traditional GAP insurance we feel that it can offer a cost effective alternative. If anyone one like any further details then please feel free to drop me a line.Regards,Dan."
"I have just purchased Gap from Frank Pickles, did the full replacement price of the SQ5 for £54k and it was £261"
"54K wow that's heavy man, did you not get any discount on the car? and have you read your T&C only every one I've looked at doesn't cover options you put on the car. It covers factory and dealer fitted options but not all theses you have in your signature.Having said that I have it too, mines back to invoice and think it's good value, but my options are not covered when you read it through.If yours does fair play."
I've gone with ALA for 3 years @ £40K claim limit for £244.Use promo code: VP10 to get 10% off.
"My quote is with ALA but mine is over 5 years not 3, is your for replacement vehicle OR back to invoice price, mine is working out at £62 per year for the replacement vehicle policy"
Back to invoice - Use the promo code that gives you an extra 10% off.So you should get 30 quid off.
cant use the code as well as i have already screwed them right down as it comes out at £405 with your code on the website but i got it for £312 via a phone call today
Oh yes if your doing via phone then yes you can't.
Thinking of ringing these guys for a quote on mine today as picking it up Tuesday.Is the cover you guys got offered/quoted as good as the Audi GAP insurance?
"I've got GAP with ALA on my current Q3 and will be useing them for my Q5. The 18 months of the Q3 policy I'll be in credit, they will transfer to the cover for the Q5, around £90. The quote for 3years cover with a £25k gap, return to invoice, will be £218, minus the £90, so £128 for the 3 years cover. The cover is the same as Audis, i.e, up to £25k to cover the gap between the cars invoice value and the insurance payout, or settlement of outstanding finance, whichever is the greatest. Audi price? £669 and the Business Manager admitted he couldn't get anywhere close to ALA."
It is better than the Audi gap insurance as these guys will cover you for REPLACEMENT VEHICLE Audi will only cover you for back to invoice so if in 4 years 11 months it gets nicked you only get back what you paid on the invoice off Audi BUT with ALA you can get cover to replace the vehicle at the current costNot even sure if Audi do 5 years cover i think they told me max 3 years but i got 5 years with ALA

"Has anyone ever had the misfortune of having to claim on a Gap insurance policy, if so how did it go regards the settlement figure agreed and how quick was it sorted out. Are there any horror stories out there of companies to avoid including ALA who I have gone with as I have 30 days cooling off period to cancel if I wish"
"Good shout Lanerboy, was going to go with the online quote but decided to phone them, saved a large chunk, actually beat you by a fiver for the same cover ;-)"
"Unfortunately, I had the misfortune to claim very recently. It all went very smoothly and my replacement SQ5 Plus is on its way. No horror stories from me. The company just happened to be ALA. I hope that all goes well.Kind regards,ZED"
"Cheers Zed that makes me feel better, do you mind me asking what happened for you to claim"
"i was in BALLATER and ended up driving into the river coming in the opposite direction. Water sensors in the doors saved the day for me. It was very difficult to get out of the car in such a situation.I liked the car so much that I have ordered another.All the best,ZED"
Hi all so winter is almost over and getting the odd crisp sunny day. But I was unsure if the mesh wind deflector was affected a high speed.
"Fly trap in summer, fly trap in winter.......... that's it."
HA HA I had noticed that but no chance of damage at speed no.
Only to the fly!!
Cool a V6 fly swatter.
i've been driving around with my pano roof open for the past few days - loves it i do.
Curious to know which tyre tread gauge is most popular with forum members and whether Digital or Analogue is the way to go. Cheers
don't laugh but the cheapest is a 20p coin other than that my late fathers 30 year old manual gauge
Yes that's true but will probably go for a cheaper analogue version as probably no need for a fancy digital tread gauge.
"Apparently, if you've got Pirellis on, you don't need one!"
Buy one of these and you get a depth gauge and digital caliper.https://www.aldi.co.uk/digital-caliper/p/092870020524000
I'm still using an old fashioned manual gauge ....................
Mark one eyeball for me
"Hi,I'm new to this site as i'm in the market for a used 2.0TDI Q5 SLINE and hope to find out some answers to my questions that Google cant help with.I'm viewing a 2011 Q5 SLINE in Grey this weekend and what to know common faults and what i should look out for when buying used?I also want to tow with my Q5 and have been reading alot about a Tow Pack. When viewing used Q5's, how can i tell if the car has the tow pack required or not?Thanks to all in advance,James"
"I'm getting my first Q5 next week so can't help you with common faults. Re the towbar though I think most come with tow prep, as opposed to pack. From what I gather this only comprises of an additional piece of wiring and is a bit misleading IMO as you will still need to buy a full towbar and audi wiring loom at about £700 fitted from the likes of PF Jones or about £2K from Audi!!!.If the car has the optional factory towbar the centre panel below the bumper will have thumb screws for easy removal and there will be a lever inside the left hand side boot access panel to allow it to swivel out."
"My 2013 Q5 sline 2.0 stronic is just coming up to the end of its manufacturer warranty period and I'd appreciate views on whether it's worth buying another 12 months from Audi.Cheapest named parts cover with £250 excess is just over £300 for 15k miles. Full cover around the £500 mark. Considering the cheapest option just to cover if anything major goes wrong.I've owned the car from new, no major issues, 34k on the clock. Fully serviced by the dealer each year.Our ideal would be to keep the car for a few more years with it transitioning to a second car in 12-18 months time.Views?"
"It's sounds expensive to me, but it's your choice. Pay now to insure against the cost that something MAY go wrong in the future."
Have you been quoted fromWARRANTYWISEthe Quentin Wilson site?
"So as already posted I've made the leap of faith and whacked down a deposit - i have 24hrs to make a call on colour.Im completely torn - seen pictures of both and both look stunning.Comments, pictures appreciated. Is Panther harder to keep clean."
Go for Lava grey or Sepang
"Funny you should say that, my wife does not like black SUVs (only input she had to model/ spec) but then when the deal was almost done decided she quite liked panther and that I could have it if I wanted!!! Almost changed but decided to stick with my gut.Take a punt on Sepang, saw one in the showroom and was sold, never even considered a blue car before."
In the flesh it's hard to tell the difference between whatever Black you have but Panther for me gives it the edge over ordinary Black and I do think the clue is in the name 'Panther' as real Panthers' have a slight purple tint in their coat colouring when seen in bright light.
"Boom - Panther black it is!Bring on March.......Steve when is your Plus scheduled to hit your driveway? (ps my wife banned me from choosing Sepang, only thing she put her foot down on!)"
wow that was fast - was the delivery ahead of the initial order date?at least get the dealer to send some pics - or maybe make the wait harder!
Panther black good choice. Looks amazing in direct sunlight not that we've had much since we picked the car up.We couldn't wait for the 16 plate. Picked our one up just before Christmas and love it.
"Panther is lovely but be warned, if you have a scrape the paint very expensive and can take some considerable time to arrive, it's also more difficult to apply, so you need a good body shop."
"WIth a change in personal circumstances possibly afoot, I am considering getting rid of the Q5.I am nearly 2 years through my PCP and had a redemption price from Audi of about £25k. I quick (under)valuation onWeBuyAnyCar.comindicates they would give me £24k for it and so i reckon I can easily sell it for £25k or more elsewhere and clear the debt.My questions is - is there restrictions on where I can sell it (if at all) due to the finance?"
"I would say you can sell it to anyone, but no one will buy it until you've first paid off the outstanding Audi finance. Not even 'we buy any car' would take it. If you can't pay off the finance then you can only give it back to Audi.You could get a prospective customer to pay the finance directly to Audi, and any difference to you. Would have to be a trusting deal with someone. I have done this before, successfully."
"WBAC and such like settle finance directly, provided their price covers the settlement. If not, you have to stump up the difference when you hand over the keys."
"Sorry SwingKing, you're right!"
Didn't realise until I had to de-ice the windscreen the other morning that the wiper arms can be moved manually across the screen from the park position. Handy for clearing any crud from the tray behind the bonnet after a car wash etc.
Can they? Just shift them across? Is it designed to be manually moved like that?
"Yep, just hold the nearside wiper arm and gently mofe it over towards the drivers side and yhen do the same to move them back to the park position."
I'll stick to the handbook recommendation of moving the wipers to the service position using the wiper stalk.Nothing in there about moving them manually.
Didn't even know there was a 'service position'..... Every day is a school day!
It can also be set from the MMI
Go to MMI wiper change position and toggle on or off. It's how you change the blades.
Think I will stick with the MMI or wiper stalk method just to be safe. Don't want to mess up the mechanism or timing.
"Hello,new to the group having picked up my 65 plate Q5 S line plus a week ago. Very pleased with it so far but have noticed that the rear nearside door doesn't shut properly sometimes. When it first happened it felt like the seat belt was caught in the door but after checking there is nothing obviously obstructing the door. Has anyone else had this issue and are there any quick solutions? Cheers."
Take it back to the dealer!
"Apologies in advance if this has been covered before but does anyone have a recommendation for the safe removal of balance weight adhesive without marking the paint once new tyres have been fitted? The wheels are the 21"" 's with the grey paint to the inner rim surface. I was thinking Autoglym intensive tar remover might do the trick but there is probably something better out there?"
As above a hair dryer and then some Autoglym tar remover for the sticky residue.
"Panel wipe for me.As above, before a tyre change I remove the weights myself.....fitters (if strictly instructed not to carve off) probably will do!"
"A visit might be sooner than you hope Raphster. My SQ5 tyres are nearly on the limit at 13,000 miles! That's Pirelli's usual wear rate apparently."
Bummer - at least it's here though.
"Hate to admit, I go with all the cleaning equipment, and remove the weights around the corner from the fitters.Yes, I am mad."
"That's not mad, I think it's pretty sensible tbh."
"Morning All,I received my PCP offer from Audi yesterday, I must say cannot stomach the 8.1k interest along with milage restrictions/charges/end value and not even owning the car until the end.I think I am going to have to forgo the 1.5k dealer contribution and pay 27k cash, 25k personal loan which is 3.8% APR, that way I only pay 2k interest over 5 years and own the car with no restrictions.Any thoughts/advise on this?"
I guess it depends if you would rather spend the £27k on something else? I take it the PCP offer was putting in a low deposit?
"The deposit was 15k from me and 1.5k from the dealer so 16.5k total.The APR was 6.7% which I thought high considering VW are advertising 4.9%.Car price was £52,863.12 after discount (which now works out just over 10% discount without the 1.5k PCP contribution)"
"I think it's something to do with the dealers being totally separate from the finance company. I imagine it happens so rarely they don't lose too much sleep over it. Maybe speak to someone at Audi Finance about your rights of termination?The other thing you can do is ask them to reduce your final payment so you pay more each month, but less interest."
"Absolutely no reason why you can't take their finance and then pay it off. I think if its too quickly paid off the dealer may loose out so it depends on how you feel about. Alternatively wait 3 or 4 months and then pay it off, no one looses and you still get the deposit contribution. You would be mad to miss out on the £1500 and 3 months on the PCP won't cost that much in interest."
I personally could not stomach over 8k interest on a 52k car my advise for what its worth would be as you say take a personnel loan and the car is yours go back to the dealer and ask for a better discount I managed nearly 13% and this was for a cash purchase
"8k interest !!! I just couldn't, complete madness if you ask me. Audi sales guy pushed and pushed for PCP over outright purchase now i know why !!Told them straight i wasn't interested. If i cant buy it i cant afford it simple as."
"I shall be taking Audi PCP gained an extra £500 dealer contribution, will need to cancel the agreement within the 14 day cooling off period. Happy days ;-)"
"I've got a BMW 435d cab cumming 1st March,it lists @58k I've managed a discount of £10800 off,with part of the deal being I take out a PCP of 28k, and they gave me £1750 off for that, I can pay it off in 3 months @ the earliest they said, the monthly payments are £193, so I'll lose those 3 payments Wich equates to just under £600, so il still be £1150 up so its a no brainier ????"
Which audi dealer in south wales are you using ?
I can see where pcp is worth doing like what SQ BEAST is doing but not to pay 8k interest over the time of having the car that's bonkers
I went PCP because having got married in July my savings diminished rapidly.I can afford to pay per month and getting rid most likely in 2 years £4K interest over the two years to me isn't a huge issue.Being relatively young and having a mortgage etc the banks wouldn't offer me enough despite my decent earnings.For me it was the only way I could get the car I want and the payments is a relatively small chunk of my monthly intake.
Personal loans do of course come with an interest charge too. Not as much as PCP of course but then you also need a decent deposit and tying up a large cash sum may not suit some.
"An update, they wouldn't budge on the 6.7%, I have been credit approved so are going with that. I have asked for the paperwork to check the early repayment T&C's but its not too forthcoming.Does anyone know when you usually sign for/start the PCP, is it when you pick up the car or a few weeks before?"
"Morning All,I received my PCP offer from Audi yesterday, I must say cannot stomach the 8.1k interest along with milage restrictions/charges/end value and not even owning the car until the end.I think I am going to have to forgo the 1.5k dealer contribution and pay 27k cash, 25k personal loan which is 3.8% APR, that way I only pay 2k interest over 5 years and own the car with no restrictions.Any thoughts/advise on this?"
I signed on collection day with first payment a month later.
"Thanks for the info guys.I had some advise yesterday from the dealer that I should wait until around 6 months to clear the PCP, also whilst doing so pay off via overpayments randomly not in one lump, he said the interest over this period would be minimal?Apparently if I clear it straight away in one transaction it could have negative effect on my credit rating, anyone else have experience or advise on this?"
I think the dealer only gets their commission from the PCP if it's in place for a certain time.........I wonder how long that might be?
Dealer/salesman gets paid when its taken out/as the car is delivered..
"Thanks Jetbeam, very clear and concise advise that I will gladly take.The withdraw method as you have suggested sounds good to me and no interest or admin charges are an added bonus.Could this really affect my credit rating after then?"
Has anyone got the Diamond stitched seats as my new car is coming with them and i am a bit concerned that the stitching is going to get dirty very easily just wondered how other peoples have worn and stood the test of time
I have them in another car - no issues.
"Thanks snow man do you not have any issues with blue jeans marking the stitching, is the stitching a nylon thread do you know"
Same for me too.
Get some leather/interior protectant down on them first.
"Had mine six months and still like new, IMO makes the car interior look much better."
"I'm not a fan of the look, reminds me of fishnet tights..."
Long time reader - first time poster!I've been contemplating for a while in getting side steps for my Q5.I can't quite decide if they will enhance the look alongside being more practical for the elder and younger folk in the family.Do they make much of a functional difference or are they merely used for personal style on the Q5?
I personally think they look good but are not practical at all I think they get in the way of getting in and out
"I had them fitted and I think they really enhance and break up the profile.As for functionality, not required, the car isn't that high for them to make much difference, maybe slightly for very small kidsI also thought at time of buying that they may protect bodywork against doors swinging into it in carparks etc, but they're too low for that.In reality, purely aesthetic value, but a real difference on that front"
"I like the look of them but needed a towbar and wanted a pano roof, Audi only let you spec 2 out of 3 for some reason."
"They definitely enhance the look, the down side is when there muddy , you have to step over them, and they really do collect the mud, but I wouldn't be without them, my 2 year old uses them to climb into the car (miss independent) , I got mine on EBAY £180 ????"
Thanks for the advice - are there any particular design type that I should go for or is it a case of erdonal preference?
*personal preference - excuse the iPhone and it's text function.
I had some ebay ones and had them fitted and love em.. £250 supplied Inc fitting.Use them to step in and great for cleaning roof. Do however get grubby and need a power wash to get muck off.Design is personal preference...
Do they create any extra noise at motorway speeds?
Not as I've noticed no.
"No noise, I think mine weigh around 40 Ish kg each side , so it is like carrying a permanent passenger, so mpg compromised, but so worth it for the look, it does make it appear a lot lower, and their definitely strong enough to stand on ????"
Good post and totally agree...
"Steel.But should of been made out of aluminium, I guess probably isn't strong enough."
Am I the only person who doesn't like them?
"No, count me in on the ""not a fan of"" brigade!"
"My first dealer told me they had scrapped the collapsible spare to reduce weight, emissions, help the environment blah blah blah, yet you can tick a box which adds 80Kgs? That is a lot of dead weight to hump around, keeps the centre of gravity low mind you."
"The pan roof must weigh sum to compromise having side steps if you've got tow bar, I say the steps were around 40 KGs , this was my guesstimateion, from wen I lifted them, either way there quite rare on Q5s generally and definitely are worth £180 ????"
"Thanks for the input/feedback, I guess I will begin my research/search for my side steps starting this weekend!"
Long time reader - first time poster!I've been contemplating for a while in getting side steps for my Q5.I can't quite decide if they will enhance the look alongside being more practical for the elder and younger folk in the family.Do they make much of a functional difference or are they merely used for personal style on the Q5?
I thought it could be maintaining structural rigidity which prevented all 3 being fitted but maybe it is just down to the weight.
Side step fone number 01355 223 052????
When I bought my Q5 in 2010 the Audi accessory list warned that the standard jack would not work with side steps fitted. Might be worth checking out
"When you order the side step, you get a different jack added to the sale."
"Seems these side steps are stainless steel, I thought thy were aluminium. 40kg per side is a lot, but the cutting of slots etc of the underbody protective trays is the bit that puts me off the most.Otherwise an easy self install.Fitting vid:What model jack is required with steps?"
"Hi guys,Checked the tread depth on my tyres this morning and found the front outers wearing more than the rest of the tyre. It seems that there is positive camber on the fronts? Is this the normal setup?The rears seem to be wearing evenly.There's about 3-4mm difference in tread between the inner part and the outer part of the fronts.Cheers,MT"
This is a symptom of excessive toe in. Could be also that track rods have been adjusted and are differing lengths meaning the toe in on turns is incorrect whilst the straight ahead toe in is ok. Either way a check is required.
"Tyre wear on my SQ5 is similar, although not as severe as you describe. A photo would help us understand.Upyonder may be correct, but I would suggest it is more than likely down to the way we drive."
I occasionally select Sport Mode (Gear stick to left etc..) but when I floor it the gear changes from S1 to S2 automatically when it hits the red zone but not sure whether it does the same up through the gear range or after S2 you have to use paddle-shift to increase/decrease gearing as not had the opportunity of doing this yet. Thanks in advance as I am sure there's plenty of SQ5 owners who floor it right up through the S gear range!!!!
Oh yes I will but will the gearbox change-up automatically or do I have to use paddle-shift to change gear?
"on my wifes BMW m sport diesel if you put it into sports and floor it then it revs much higher but it will still change gear itself I don't need to use the paddle shift but it stays in each gear longer and revs higher before it changes, would have thought the SQ5 will be the same"
Sorry but do you have to select'Launch Control'or is this just S-Mode?
"never tried the launch control on wifes BMW it does say how to do it but I don't fancy putting the gearbox etc under all that strain just to go a bit faster I worry it may cause harm later in life, just my personal view obviously"
"Of course, you do not have to select launch control.Select S mode, by pulling gear stick back or using ADS,NOTby pulling gear stick to the left! The car is still in full auto, i.e. will change gear for you albeit at higher revs than in D. When in S mode the engine is more responsive with an enhanced exhaust note.Pulling gear stick to the left does not select S mode."
pulling stick to left just engages semi auto mode..it still changes gear automatically when hits red line to safeguard the engine.
Hi All.1st ever new car ordered (hopefully picking up late march)So the Question I have is:Will the dealer reveal the car from under a cover or does it have to be requested or is it for mega expensive cars only ?Not sure what to expect if anything at all.What did you get when you picked up your new car ?Cheers
"Think it depends on the dealer. Never happened to me, luckily."
Wot dealer are you buying from . I bought a new Q3 from crawley in 2014 and was just handed the keys and was point to it in the car park and it was raining so not good. Then since then I have bought 2 Q5s one in 2014 and 2016 from tunbidgewells which both times the car was in a separate room covered over . Enjoy the time when you pick yours up
"I am picking up from Bury St Edmunds, But Crawley is on my doorstep but could not get near price (Over £3k out !)"
"You asked what did we get? When we picked up the SQ5 the salesman said we could choose anything we wanted from this glass cabinet, it had a bottle of champagne (non specific brand), key rings all sorts of tat to be honest. I asked for a rubber boot liner and an umbrella. Was given the boot liner but not the brolly. So basically you don't get much. That was Cheshire Oaks Audi."
Pretty much standard that they do the real for all cars.However if the dealer has lots of cars going out it might depend..
"I told them not to wash mine, so it was left in the carpark."
"MK Audi had the handover room so collected the SQ5 from there, just a keyring though.With the old A1 the Wife got a nice bunch of flowers"
"So, with the upgraded Q3 and Q7, with '3D Grill' etc pretty much established, has anyone get any inside updates on the Q5's arrival?Tried to get info from the salesman at the showroom, as I'm ready to upgrade now, being close to 2 yrs old, but very little info forthcoming.Nothing official on their internal audi web he reckons, but feels it will be end of this year.So whether to go for the End of line 190 ps model now, as its all ironed out or wait for the newbie, which will maybe have teething problems.The current model will soon look 'old' and depreciate (even more) rapidlly, no doubt."
"i was in the same predicament - but a 3yr old Q5 will take an even bigger hit when the new shape Q5 arrives.i bit the bullent and bought a new Q5 now so that it will be about 2yrs old when the new shape Q5 is a year old and the impact of the new kid on the block won't detract as much from what is still a great car (the current model).change now, not later is my feeling, and what i did."
"Thanks for the feedback, interesting.Was it you who mentioned in a different thread that you acheived a good discount on the new 190ps, because it was coming to end of line?My dealer is willing to go to about 8%, saying it's NOT E.O.L as yet, because new one not announced.Obviously i could probably get better with carwow or somewhere, but been happy with the dealership so far and would prefer to go direct with them unless it's massive diff."
"The best carwow could do for me was 8.4% and that would have involved a bit of travelling. I got 9.1% by phoning around but others have managed 12. I think there is a lot to be said for staying local though, particularly if you already have a good relationship with the dealer."
"8.5% discount on new SQ5 Plus and dealerships seem to have a bit more flex on finance too - historically Audi PCP was at around 6.5% but current offer of 4.9% on the new one.As for when the new model Q5 hits UK showrooms, dealerships won't confirm anything (as they don't know themselves), but several are hinting early to mid 2017 for new 2.0 litre models, autumn 2017 for 3.0 versions and Spring 2018 for the new SQ5.However you want to read it, probably safe to say it'sat least12 months away from any new model Q5, and possibly nearer two years for the all-new SQ5."
My PCP offer is 6.7% and only today when trying to improve I was told this is fixed nationally on SQ5 plus?
"Worth double checking their latest ""Key to Key"" product where you come out of one Audi vehicle finance contract - usually (and as in my case) at the end of year 2 of a 3 year PCP - and go straight into another new one.This lower figure was described as a ""customer discount for continued brand loyalty""...but I'm wise enough to know that I'm now tied into a new 3 year finance deal."
i bleated to my dealer like a little girl about the emissions scandal and got a good 12.7% discount on my new Q5 with Extended Black Styling Pack.i haven't heard of any 'end of line' deals yet.
"You got that from the dealer !!??I hadn't barely mentioned the emission scandal, but will now!I've sent you a PM if you don't mind having a look."
"Sj1000 said:Regardless of 'discount' or 'trade in', it really all just comes down to the change over price doesn't it.I'm talking about an almost exact replica replacement, (down to same colour)So, at what will be 2 yrs old, 18,000 miles, I have been given a change over figure, (cash deal, so no PCP complications as yet)Without being over- indulgent, and for a bit of fun, and for a bit of reality, I'd like to hear from anyone who doesn't mind, your estimations/guesses of what that figure would be (or should be even)Taking into account End of Line product, and ofcourse 'that' scandal , which i'm heroically prepared to ignore and be loyal to Audi.Such dedication!Click to expand...if i swap like for like - my 31K 63 plate Q5 will only cost me £3300 to get a nice new shiny one, but i added quite a few extras and will pay £5K for a new car with alot more extras (see my sig block for details),"
"It seems fairly certain that the next 'Q' model will be the Q2, to be announced at the Geneva motor show in early March. An educated hunch would suggest that the Q2 will go on sale in the late summer probably as the Q5 is launched and the order book opened - so most likely the next Q5 is a 2017 model. Let's face it the current Q5 is pretty outdated both in Audi technology and styling terms, getting a bit long in the tooth now."
I managed 12.5% discount on new SQ5 plus as a cash purchase but it took a bit of work regards playing dealers off with each other but worth it for me saved me about 6.5k that's a nice family holiday
"I'm confused here, is this an extra £3300 on the deposit for PCP or something?Can't be a cash transaction of that amount to swap a 2 yr old one for a new one, surely ??"
"Although I'm thinking of changeing brand for a new SUV , I'd gladly part with £5k for a new SQ after 2 and half years enjoyable ownership ????????"
"As an owner of a pre facelift Q3, I wouldn't consider a face lifted model because I dislike the new treatment they've given the grille. This is one of the reasons I decided to go for the current Q5, space being another factor. The new SUV grilles Audi are fitting make the front end look a bit low rent imho. Looking forward to 1st March pick up, but where in 2/3 years time? who knows!"
You are usually exceedingly well informed from past experience Snow Man so I'm in no doubt you do know! I'm talking to my dealer now about exiting my SQ5 shortly and I'll order a Q2 when the order book opens.
does anybody have a front grille SQ5 badge going?Either some little scrote has stolen it or the Audi build quality is such that the glue last three months!I don't like driving an S5 so can't anybody help out a fellow owner before I get robbed at the stealership?
ouch £62.50 on ebay
"Unless you are willing to ""relieve"" another parked SQ5 of their badge I'm afraid it sounds like you will be getting robbed by your dealer."
A lot of money for a badge!
How much is it from the dealer?
just seen this which is a decent price i thought as its genuine Audihttp://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/ORIGINAL-AUDI-Q5-SQ5-EMBLEM-SLOGAN-RADIATOR-GRILLE-8R0853737B-2ZZ-CHROME-RED-NEW-/261601308215?hash=item3ce8a72e37:g:3hcAAMXQVERS1qrP
Thanks but enough moaning to Audi and a Twitter post has led to them replacing and fitting FOCBadge is £24 from the dealer and £35 to fit!!!
"I've had a thule towbar rack for a few years, it's pretty good, only downside is that mine has fabric straps for the wheels and they loosen off, I need to use bungee cords as well.The plastic ratchet straps they use on the roof mounts are much better, not sure what the 927 uses."
"I have theAtera STRADA DL 3, which I have had for the last 3 years and works really well. I have used it on my previous Q5 and current SQ5. Bought it from here:http://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/all-products/atera_strada_dl_3_to_4_bike_carrier_uk_lights_no_ar2603/Qx%40w%2C6M4PHS%2CZGenkQvENtdosM"
"Thanks All,gingamog - That Altera one looks good too with the sliding back action instead of the tilt, I only thought to look at the Thule.Mobydick - I had the 591 Thule roof rack on may last rs4 and that was excellent, good to hear the one velo compact is as good.Need to choose between them now."
"I also got the Altera but the tilting one rather than sliding. It comes as a two bike carrier with an add on for the third bike which was handy as most of the time I will only have two bikes. Such a pain before having to lift bikes on to the roof with invariably muddy shoes on standing on the sills, nearly came a cropper a number of times!"
"j1sgo said:Thanks All,gingamog - That Altera one looks good too with the sliding back action instead of the tilt, I only thought to look at the Thule.Mobydick - I had the 591 Thule roof rack on may last rs4 and that was excellent, good to hear the one velo compact is as good.Need to choose between them now.Click to expand...The tilt action comes in very handy when you need to access the boot...usually after the bikes have been mounted. It is very easy to setup too and I have carried 3 bikes easily with no problems."
"+1 but I have the 3 bike version, extendable to 4.Fully loaded with 4 mountain bikes it's a heavy piece of kit but FF tow bar seems to cope fine."
"The Thule tilt action is a superb piece of engineering and still cannot believe it doesn't all just fall off! Looks the part and had a few questions asked about it when parked up as so simple.Looked at the Altera and it came down to price and availability and a local caravan place had a great offer on the Thule, never looked back...."
"My SQ5 is coming up on 2 years old in a few weeks and will need first service. Miles are low at just over 11k.MMI says oil service needed in 41 days and also inspection. I know the inspection really isn't anything much as regards work but guess they may charge. Also know from my BMW experience that often they ""do"" the inspection at same time as oil service for little or no cost.So what is it going to cost me , what has anyone else paid for similar servicing?"

Mine was two years old in November 15K had both oil and inspection done £405.Maidstone Audi.
"Just booked mine in for first full service, inspection (and new pollen filter) , will be 22 months old and approx 17,500 miles.£347"
"Quoted £340 for oil , inspection and new pollen filter."
"Knew I was robbed, but Canterbury wanted the same and Bexley wanted £11 more so I reckon you've got a good fair price bud."
"Mine booked in tomorrow for £372. Needs Adblue too, is that part of service? Probably not from what I can find and any excuse to through a couple of quid on..."
Same dealer phoned me today offering the service for £354. I will take it at yesterday's email price of £340 please was my reply.Includes collection and return as I'm 50 miles from the dealer and courtesy car for the over night they have mine.
"1st service on the SQ @ 9,500 miles cost me £229 from Newcastle Audi, my car is on the fixed service schedule not the variable. Not sure if that affects the cost price of the service."
"When I went in after 9,000 miles, the service manager came out to the car and just physically reset it to notify at 19,000 miles (or 2 years)"
"It's worth considering a maintenance plan, I think I pay £30 a month 3 years/60,000 miles. My local dealer is Listers, their own plan worked out as better value than Audi's.	It's not a bargain of course but removes the big surprises, typically the 1st service is £300-£350 and the 2nd service is around £700."
"Just put my reg in on the SQ to get an idea of trade value in we bye any car , I was suppressed how high it was £33,125 ????????"
More than they are offering for the wifes on the same year..
"Do they go into the spec. in detail?Suppose they must for accurate quotation, and if so SQ Beasts looks like a massive spec."
"They only look at ""big"" options like nav and pano roof."
Out of curiosity I've done a quote and they are offering me £38k on my vehicle as below with 3.5k on the clock!
yes I bet they are bleeding rob dogs I would not sell to them EVER
"Correct, leather, nav, service history so there should be no reason for a difference in price.."
"They didn't ask spec , I just put in reg , owners, and mileage , I was expecting £28k with there usual piss take prices, so I'm thinking I'll sell @£35k if I decide to in March , I'll put on forum 1st c wat bites I get ????"
It does that if you've used the site before and basically just wants an update to those things that impact the price.
"I managed to nab myself an absolute bargain on some genuine 20"" RS4 styles in gunmetal grey on Dunlop Winter Sport Maxx 3D.Now is it appropriate weather to fit these to the SQ5? I am conscious the temperature is dropping but no snow down here forecast.Should I fit as its consistently sub five degrees and some nasty frosts or am I wasting my time and money fitting?"
They will give you better grip in the wet not just on ice/snow.
So get them on then I guess! They have approx 5mm which is good for fitting?
General tyre industry advice is that winter rubber should be replaced when the tread depth reaches 4mm so there is not a lot of life left if yours are down to 5mm.
"Hello from CanadaWinter tires use rubber that's formulated to be grippier in snow, sleet, slush and even just plain cold. As you approach freezing temps, 38'F can result in glare ice. Also, summer tires harden as they get colder, and don't provide as good traction in cold weather as do snow tires, and obviously much less traction in snow, sleet, and slush. All season tires, though better in winter than summer tires, aren't nearly as good as real winter tires."
"They, and the car, look gorgeous, if you asked me."
"with the 'winter' we are currently getting, why bother?"
Temps have dropped and forecast snow over the weekend. I'd rather protect the 21s also from road salt etc
I agree it looks better on the 21's but I will be doing the same and have bought some 20's with winter tyres on just so I can protect the 21's from all the salt etc plus winter tyres give amazing grip compared to normal tyres when the temp drops

I always chuck mine on the end of October - just in case. Never had a problem even this 'Winter' the temperatures have been quite warm. They'll stay on until after Easter as we're driving to St Anton to go skiing.
As previously posted had my car serviced and a new bumper fitted. Forgot to mention that a software update was done for a possible issue with the Air con staying on after the car is parked up. Not happened to me but let them do it anyway. Unfortunately it has wiped out my VCDS mods.
"Strange, I had the aircon software update done when I went for my last service, my mods were still there afterwards"

"At the risk of appearing very sad I'll admit to having another look on Germany's auto trader in an effort to view an actual photo of a non macaw plus.Good news - for me anyway - is that there are now a few on there, quite a few sepang, monsoon and panther - which I'm starting to think I should have gone for, it looks really good and at least one white.I can't post a link but for those interested the website ismobile.deand works like auto trader.Happy New Year to you and yours."
"j1sgo said:Thanks Steve for the heads up, just spent over an hour scrolling through the 45 pages of SQ5s but I am glad to say I found an SQ5 Plus to almost my exact spec. The black mirrors, roof spoiler and top of the door handles stand out well on the shots of the Glacier White model, not too well on the Sepang and of course non existent on my choice of Panther Black.I am also glad I went for the gloss black alloys, the titanium finish somehow does not look quite right.It is interesting to note that the German spec does not have the black mirrors, roof spoiler and door handles as standard or the diamond pattern seats. Lots of Daytona's on the site as well so maybe a standard colour over there.Thanks for finding.Click to expand...No problem, the black does look very nice, but actually all the colours look pretty good IMO.You're right about the spec, I had a play about on the german configurator (trying in vain to save a few bob), daytona is available to them and they also have a much wider range of wheels, including black RS4 style, 2 options I would probably have gone for if available over here.Looks like they get the red callipers for free as well, every one seems to have them.Knew my higher german would come in handy eventually"
Yes the plus does look good I notice that the exhaust tips are different on the plus than on the standard SQ5.
"here is the search:http://suchen.mobile.de/fahrzeuge/search.html?scopeId=C&zipcode=&damageUnrepaired=NO_DAMAGE_UNREPAIRED&makeModelVariant1.makeId=1900&makeModelVariant1.modelId=39&makeModelVariant1.modelDescription=plus&isSearchRequest=true&pageNumber=1skip past the 'Navi Plus' models and you will see the SQ5 Plus, very nice indeed."
"It's not the tips that have changed, a chrome plate now co-joins the two pipes, where the SQ5 has a gap between them!"
hell yeah!
"Mine was the 11th, now showing as in quality control! Better start trying to figure out how I'm going to pay for it I suppose."
"The cover stopped closing recently and flagged it up whilst having the car serviced.Had a call from the service manager and it has to have a new bumper, apparently part of the hinging mechanism is welded to the bumper."
Exactly my thoughts.
I would ask if I could have the old bumper
"It's not costing me anything as it is under warranty, but am a bit surprised that a whole bumper is needed for a headlamp washer.I wondered at first if they had pranged it whilst test for a roof rattle on the panoramic roof."
"I appreciate that, but it would be nice to keep a spare bumper, ..... just in case"
"Picked up my car today and all is well, bumper sprayed of the car and the pint matches really well.Apparently the whole unit had come away from the bumper so somehow the plastic welding has failed."
I'm sorry Sq5john what on earth do they do for £700 ???????Dave
"Not as much as you'd like I'm sure however the labour rate is the wrong side of £100/hour I expect. I think the 2nd service includes a brake fluid change and the cabin pollen filter as well, no one said running an Audi was cheap however the upside is that being engineered properly in the 1st place means visits between services are unlikely...."
"Agree with sq5 John..... About Better engineering.....But I think you also have to consider that spending over 40k on a vehicle won't be cheap to maintain... Even if it means being ripping off.... Could be worse, you could own a Porsche and change all 4 tyres and have a service at the same time..........Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
I have owned a Q5 and now an SQ5 for a total of 6 years and have spent only a fraction of the cost of your service plan. I would rather have the money in my account than Audi's.
"That is way more than I have spent, but each to their own. Don't get the easier solution, the service indicator comes up and your wife books a service, how hard can that be?"
"Ha ha, you don't know my wife. Nothing is ever easy"
also at 3800 miles you need gearbox oil and filter change about another £200
Who told you that?
3800 or 38000?
"Im approaching 8500 miles on the SQ now, what tyres is everyone running and how much miles did they get from there first set from the factory?"
"I've had all 4 makes on mine ,due to punctures,early wear from my concrete foot and found Pirelli worst,then continental ,then verdnsteins, Dunlop seem to b the best all round,and are available @£190 a corner for 21"" ????"
We got someMichelin yesterday - £205/ea
Came with Pirelli's got 14500 miles out of them changed at 2mm got Pirelli's again only because I got all four new for £650 through a mate and the car will be sold sometime next year so not to bothered about it. But do agree with SQ BEAST Pirelli are shite.
"Ok so pirelli shite, dunlops then?"
"Goodyear excellence on 20"". 21,000 miles done and 6mm tread left on rears and front. amazing! The wife drives the car."
"Ditto, I've just passed 21,000 miles on 20"" Goodyears too - 4mm left front, 6mm rear, can't complain about that at all."
"Yep. goodyears on mine, looking new after 15,000 miles"
"I forgot to mention im on the 21's, but all great feedback, never expected them to be lasting that long, thats amasing really"
Where from Beast as my Pirelli are just about shagged after 14k
"Started a thread myself on this topic last week but luddite skills mean I can't link to it.Bottom line here is that 21"" Dunlop's have worn well but around the Midlands it's currently impossible to source new ones (8-10 weeks lead / supply time quoted), so have just shod vehicle (2 days ago) with Pirelli P Zero's at £180 per corner fully fitted, tracking checked, balanced etc.Michelin's seemed silly money and past experience of Conti's has been pants, so guess you could call it a distressed purchase."
I went for Dunlops due to the lack of options in 21s. I did however only get 9500 miles out the original ones...
Maidstone in Kent ????
"So i need 4 tyres and have been looking around it seems you get Pirelli,Dunlops,Contis and now you can get Michelin Latitude Sport3 X have just been released any one used these yet i got them for £211.40 each fitted ??this is for 21""s"
Just been told they cant get them till 18th December GGGGRRRRRRRRRR
Bout time micheln got involved ????
"Just been quoted £170. 38 each for Bridgestone 20 inch. I have the same tyre on the car at present, done 18k. Not sure what to go for this time."
"Pirellis for me, don't care about the poor wear, just want the best tyre for the job. 32k kms on my rears, and they have probably another 5k in them, before i hit the wear indicator. Fronts changed at 22k."
"I have Goodyears on 20"" wheels, they have done 29500 miles and were rotated at 12000 miles. There is 2mm left until I reach the wear indicator."
"That's encouraging to hear. 21""?"
"Im approaching 8500 miles on the SQ now, what tyres is everyone running and how much miles did they get from there first set from the factory?"
"I'm on 21"" Pirelli's. 10.5k into the car (from new) and still a good 5mm+ on them. I don't drive slow but I also don't rag the bends which is probably whats making them last.MT"
"I've not even got the car yet but am not looking forward to having to fork out so much for tyres, never bought bigger than 18"" before, usually Michelin.Has anyone put 265's on the 21"" rim, there seems to be a wider choice than the 255 and they are a bit cheaper, wouldn't suppose an extra 5mm each side will be a problem."
"Hmm, interesting point Steve. I suspect you would have to inform the insurers as it is a deviation from factory spec but I agree that there seems to be more choice of tyres in the bigger profile. I think I'll be due new tyres shortly, after 12k miles, and thinking of getting price and more importantly availability from my tyre fitter as it seems getting hold of the 21's might be an issue - I've read on this forum of 8-10 weeks delivery which is both ridiculous and worrying!"
Might give a little extra protection to kerb damage?
"Must admit that thought had also crossed my mind.Unfortunately I don't have an SQ5 to hand yet but was wondering how the 255s look on the 8.5J rim, are they flush or do they bulge a bit? I've went up 10mm on a couple of previous cars with no adverse effects but there seems to be mixed views on whether or not 265s should be on at least a 9J.PS I realise I'm getting a bit ahead of myself, the build hasn't even commenced yet!"
"Very interested in this option and will start looking up some reviews of the bigger rubbers.. Mine aer on about 8k now so hopefully a good 5 or 6k to go, but I might have to order well in advance if I'm going like for like.."
I doubt you would notice the difference unless you looked at two wheels shod with different sized tyres together. I also doubt there would be any noticeable difference in the handling. You MAY have a problem after an accident. I believe assessors check tyres for tread depth and speed rating and he might just notice non standard tyre size fitted. My son got into bother when they noticed he had fitted an after market K&N air filter.
"It would be worth keeping them in the loop and declaring any changes, just to be on the safe side, not that it would be like them to try and wriggle out of a payout!"
"i've got the same, 21's with Pirellis. 11,000 miles and i reckon i've got 4 or 5mm left. probably nearer 4. so hopefully will get 15 or 16k out of them before needing to change. not looking forward to the bill for £800 ish"
Had my sq5 serviced yesterday... 21k miles... 3mm Left on the rear pirelli tyres from factory ...Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"Or just set an amount of money aside for a few months if it makes you feel better. Same end result though, a big wedge spent on rubber!"
Add tyres to next years Santa list ............. and be a good boy
Out of interest do some tyres give greater kerb protection as notice that my P-Zero's have a nicely extended ridge that should give some low level kerb damage?
"As the topic states, hope 2016 brings happiness to all."
Back @ u guys ????
Merry Christmas to all members ????
and to you and yours
Merry Christmas and lets hope the New Year brings us all a bit of snow for our Quattro's!
"Good to know, about time they supplied something for free although, if I was a cynic, I might think it's a very good way to ensure they get all of the repairs at £120 per hour + parts + VAT. Still good for the customer though and I'll be signing up."
"When I receive my Q5 brochure in the post last week there was an additional leaflet explaining Audi Enshurance, shall be taking this out when my new car arrives."
Third crash this year? No wonder you want to change it
"Never heard of it but I've just signed up, cheers!"
and dread to think what next years premium will be
"""Still good for the customer though and I'll be signing up.""You missed that part of my quote rifleman!!!!PS what neck of thewoods do you normally commute - just that, with your record (impressive by the way) I want my satnav set to avoid you ;-)"
Already stored (since I picked up the SQ5) in my phone contacts with policy number. Not used yet and I hope I never have to.
thanks for explaining this I will be signing up when my new car arrives
Just my thoughts! Having a non fault claim from 4 years ago still pushes my premium up!
"I got the text and email when i bought my car, they are basically an accident management company with audi brandingi remember a member on here being less than impressed with their servicehttp://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/17025-audi-ensurance/page__hl__ensurance__fromsearch__1"
I signed up for it when I bought my Q5. Free 3 year membership can't go wrong although never have had to use it.
"It seems like a bit of a no brainier as it doesn't cost you anything and seems to offer a genuine Audi backed service. I'm surprised that the dealer never mentioned it during handover, especially as they try and sell you gap and alloy insurance."
They don't mention it because it's a free service and that they dont make any money from it unlike gap etc...and that they don't really care. I wasn't told I found out by going to the owners section of the audi website where I stumbled across The words FREE AUDI ESSURANCE WITH EVERY NEW AUDI SIGN UP
Yep unless the dealer is making £ they probably don't care.
"It's a shame they don't mention it as its a selling point for the car. Maybe they should tell you as they are convincing you to buy , then once they've got you they can try selling the extra insurances which I never take."
"I think I am with Missile on this one. It reminds me of accident claim companies run by lawyers that charge extortionate prices to insurance companies to hire you a car and claim for damages.I just don't like ripping anyone off. Fair and reasonable is my motto.Although I am just guessing at the moment, time will tell whether this is the case."
Would you cat be listed on the v5c as damaged and repaired? Also would this affect the resale price if trading in to your main dealer?
"This is not a new service, I took it out nearly three years ago."
"Barbyboy said:FWIW, this isn't new, it isn't special and I don't think that VAG are trying to be furtive or selective about promoting 'Ensurance' either.It's a no-cost-to-the-consumer bolt-on product (a bit like free servicing or breakdown cover), where the underwriting cost to the manufacturer is likely to be pretty minimal in the context of things.For the sceptics out there, VAG of late seem to recognise that they're in times of trouble and if they can offer / promote something that instills a teeny weeny bit of consumer confidence (at very little underwriting cost to themselves), then that can't be a bad thing - either for themselves in terms of re-building brand, image and reputation, or for the vehicle owner too.That's it - nothing more, nothing less.Click to expand...I don't this this is costing VAG any money. I think they will make money as the claims company will pay them for each referral at the expense of the insurance company. But then I might be paranoid and completely wrong."
I think as BarbyBoy kinda mentioned this is free to Audi customer on the surface. But as we all know nothing in life is really free. I suspect that the Audi Ensurance 'outfit' will have costs and bills to pay and will be recovering costs from the insurance companies or from Audi or both.So your insurance premium may potentially increase more using this service than without? :?
"if you have a prang you have a prang - they don't penalise you for being looked after properly when you had your prang.why settle for your own insurance sending it to a non-approved garage and fitting non-approved parts?if you are OK with the above just in case your premium might be a little higher because you had premium service when your car was damaged (even though i am sure it won;t be) then by all means don't bother with Audi Ensure, but having used it three times now and been overwhelmed by the service i received - i wouldn't dare be without it."
"What a great free service, also just signed up as had no idea this existed either.Same with the owners part of the website - will take a look at that as well"

I suspect they are not interested because they don't have the other driver's details therefore no insurance company to invoice for all the legal advice they gave you.
Wife had an accident in my Q5 back in Oct where she was at fault so I thought I'd give Audi Ensurance a try. Must say I shouldn't have bothered as I was still instructed to call my insurance company and still had to liase with the bodyshop myself directly.
"i was at fault when i hit a tree - they were still great and handled everything although at the time i didn't need a courtesy car they still sorted out the approved Audi repair garage (which happens to be a mile from my house).that was my first accident in my Q5, my first time to use Audi Ensure and i was so impressed that i put them on SpeedDial, and used them for 2 accidents after this - both of which they handled brilliantly.the FREE Legal Cover alone is a bonus - no point paying your own insurance company for it when you already get it for free with Audi."
"Rifleman...with reference to your location in your sig, was the approved bodyshop Premier Panels in Farnham?"
"Hi,I am aware of other Audi owners having issue with the drainage channels getting blocked with debris. These can be difficult to clear. I noticed a lot of leaves collected in the scuttle area under my bonnet whilst cleaning my car. You might want to check your vehicle?"

"There's also drainage channels at the bottom of the doors (about 1"" wide each), I always give them a wipe everytime I clean the car.MT"
HiI have an Audi Q5 it's brand new. Bought it from Stoke AudiWhen I bought it I noticed on the inside of the steering wheel that there is a little plasticky looking thead or stitch that is sticking out. It's so tiny you wouldn't know it's there unless you rub your finger across it which makes it noticeable. You need a light to see it.It's at the bottom of the steering wheelAm I being stupid or is this a defect?
"If your not happy with it or it's uncomfortable, I would say it's a defect. Go back to the dealer and tell them your not happy with it."
Can you cut it off?
"That was my thought! I had a tiny loose thread on my steering wheel which I chopped off... if the whole thing started to unravel I'd take it into dealer, but not going to worry in the mean time!"
Get the dealer to cut it off - then if it goes wrong its their problem!
Sepang blue every time but I would give the black pack a wide berth as I personally think it does the vehicle no favours. It is all down to what each individual likes and you should spend your own cash on what you like rather than what others think looks good.
"thanks cruicd, but to be fair - i like the black grille, i like the black mirrors and i like the black alloys so i have no complaints there.blue does look good but i'm not sure i can bring myself to owning a blue car?!i currently have a Lava Grey S-Line Plus with Off-Road Alloys and would like a colour which looks noticeably different to what i currently have while contrasting the Extended Black Styling pack quite well."
"I'd vote for Sepang blue. My 2015 Q5 is Scuba Blue. I'm into blue, as you might guessEdited to add:But I very much prefer chrome/aluminum trim rather than the black appearance package."
Daytona Grey. I like the way it suits the body with the black styling pack.
It's Floret Silver for me if you're going with the black pack!Daytona Grey looks great on this car with silver trim (I have it) - but it is very commonSepang Blue would be my choice if I was ordering tomorrow but again only with silver trim.
Daytona Grey !!!
Definitely sepang to show off the black hihhlights. It will always look clean too.
"2 or 3 but neither really works with the crappy black ""styleless"" pack for me..."
Sepang blue that's what I have ordered just stunning
"Daytona GreyThough they always look better and classier without the black pack, but i can understand the allure of getting those beautiful wheels at the reduced price in the extended package"
Daytona Grey although silver isn't as popular in Q5/SQ5
"rifleman I was in a similar situation, torn between Sepang Blue and Daytona Grey without doubt Sapang Blue highlights the Black pack however after looking at both colours on other Audi models I preferred the subtle look of Daytona grey with extended Black styling pack."
"Floret Silver would be much better contrasting with the black styling pack, rather then that blue."
Floret silver . Looks good
i was thinking of replacing the rear Audi Rings with black ones to compliment the front and finish off the black styling look at the front end - might look good on Silver?
"I've had RSs in both colours, the only comment i'd add is they are pearlescent so in the winter months they can seem dull by comparison to metallic paints."
sweet! where can i get all black badges from Beast?
"Wait for the new model, let the dust settle on the VW issues."
"It would appear you are not happy with your decision? Is your glass half full or half empty?I would rather regret the mistakes (and I have made a few!) than obsess over things I wish I had done.Life is far too short to worry about things over which you have no control.Follow your heart, wherever it leads you."
"That's good advice and is one of the options I've been thinking about.Trouble is I can't find out much about release date or what engines will be available. I could probably contain myself for 6 months with a definite deadline but if it's into 2017 or later before the SQ5 equivalent appears, well I'm not getting any younger!"
"Well put Missile,Trouble is my heart's got me in the shxt more times than I care to remember, it's my head that got me out relatively unscathed.Heart says fxxk it, head (which I don't ignore so much these days) says don't be an arse.Now wrong side of 50, must be an age thing!Mind you - ""Act in haste - Repent in an SQ5"" doesn't sound so bad."
"Well if residuals have taken a big hit then why not settle for a ""pre-owned"" one and save yourself a shed load of money? I suspect there is a lot of scare mongering about the residuals though and you will have a lot of trouble finding one.My 18 month old Q5 was advertised at not much less than you could get a new one for after the scandal broke and it was sold within ten days."
"You might get a second hand bargain from someone who is panicking over the emission issue?You might want to explore a PCP deal? With a guaranteed residual value, you would not loose out if residuals do fall."
You'll prob get a new bargain!!!
"I was thinking like you but I ordered it anyway as I keep my cars on average 4-6 years and by this time I think it will all have died down about emissions and if it looses a bit more than I thought so what do I care, no not really. At least I will have had a smile on my face for the next 5 years driving it around and you don't know what the next 5 years hold for any of us, I lost 3 mates last year suddenly and they were all under 55 years of age. The dealers 3 of hem told me a new shape SQ5 will not be available till mid to end of 2017 and I could not wait that longGET IT BOUGH YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO"
"Order the model for 2017 ,secure a 13% discount, and bye a 2 year old 1 for now at a bargain till new 1 comes ????"
"Your a cash man ,make some silly offers ,there's always some 1 who needs quick sale,just make sure u get car fully checked ????"
Check pre-owned and buy at the right price or try for a massive discount on a Standard SQ5 as my guess is that most people will now be going for the Plus model so the Standard model may be a more attractive proposition and better value for money if you can live without the bling of the Plus. I will be interested to see a head-to-head between the standard SQ5 and Plus model when it finally arrives and reckon there will be no noticeable difference in power!!
"I personally don't think it's blingy at all, but you are right there's only about 14bhp difference. May try that on carwow just out of curiosity, no sports diff though."
First offer on a standard SQ5 just in - 8.3% - exactly the same as the plus.
"when you say same as a plus do you mean you added the extras to make it the same spec as a plus, I got 12.5% discount on my plus order"
"Yep added most of the same spec, took it up to about 53 or 54k before the offer.8.3 was the best carwow came up with on the plus, I got 9 by phoning about, maybe I should phone your dealer?"
"I ended up with 13.5% on a Q5 I found the best offer with Drive the deal, I screened shot the page and stuck it under my dealers nose, happy days"
"5 offers in, best is 8.3, worst is 4.4, which came from the same dealer who offered me 21% of a heavily specced A6 bitdi black edition. What's all that about?"
12% is pretty standard and has been for a while.
"Think he was referring to what ""We buy any car"" offered me for mine - shan't be accepting it as it represents a £17,000 reduction on the new list price for a car with 1500 miles registered on 19/9/15"
I know they are not famed for their generous offers but that is taking the proverbial.
Take the finance if it improves the discount then cancel it within the 14 day period. Happy days.
Sneaky - I like it
Yep sure is Im doing the same saved an extra £500 plus an extra £500 dealer contribution
"Just so I'm clear on this guys, car is 51.5K, how much finance would I need to take out? I'm assuming that if it's cleared, i.e. I change my mind within the 14 days, the dealer and Audi contribution is safe and there is no penalty clause?Forgive my scepticism but it seems too easy?"

Good decision. I know you will be pleased when it comes. I was pleased when I had dealings with Perth Audi.
"Good to know you rate these guys missile, when I cancelled they were absolutely fine, even though the car was locked in and they were already committed.Incidentally managed to get a price on the german config, in the UK it's about £2k more, with less choice, for a standard SQ5 plus, hey ho!"

Yeah - good luck!4 years ago...
"Meanwhile, in 2015, my SQ5 has managed to hold on to 68% of its value after a mere 2 months and 1500 miles…."
"oh, I didn't see a date on it"
"Traded in my Q5 S-Line Plus 2013 in September for new SQ5 and got £27,000 from Audi dealer which was a similar price that WebuyAnyCar were offering. Just tried again using reg of old Q5 and WBAC quote £25,000 that's around £2,000 less in just 3 months. So using that calculation it would drop another £2,000 in the next 3 months by then it would have been 3 years old and worth £22,000 thats around 45% depreciation or 55% retained value. Not sure whether the emission scandal has affected this or whether it would only be worth that under normal circumstances?"
"I would suggest that extrapolation of any change over such a short time frame may not be realistic. Please note many factors could be at play, e.g. trade in values are subject to seasonal variation."
Yes I understand that but would have thought that during winter months trade in for SUV would be at their strongest?
"It is my understanding that the trade-in value of all cars decline over winter. However, my point was this is only factor which may (or may not) be affecting the value of your car. No doubt WBAC consider many factors before giving a valuation. Some of these will be unrelated to your vehicle."
"Sorry I am getting a bit confused here so I will wait until next February and give my old cars details to WBAC and see what they offer. My guess is it will be around £22-23,000 which will take us back to around 55% retained value which is far away from what Q5 owners have come to expect. Yes I know a new Q5 is on its way but its still unsettling."
Whatever ..... speak to the hand
Yes I think that's preferable.
@GRANDDUC - my personal view is that you will see a significant and measurable depreciation in VAG vehicles as a result of the emissions scandal - which will obviously be most acute in high value cars like Audis.However trying to read that into the current quotes either from dealers or websites is pointless at this stage - as missile points out there are lots of other factors which will play into it in the short term.Give it another 6 months and you will have enough data to maybe spot a trend - which is what the lawyers (and VAG) will be doing.
When we sold my wifes 2012 bmw 123d soft top wbac price increased by over £1000 in 3 weeks but I never sold it to them any way as when you get to your appointment they beat you down on price they are a waste of space I know as 2 mates have had this happen to them
"purephase - I understand what you are saying but the fact is that if I were in the market to trade my old Q5 today I would get around £2,000 less than I got in September. There are no doubt a number of reasons for this but facts are facts."
They'll try it on but if you walk they will call you back if they want the car - I took an M3 into them years ago and they tried to knock off all sorts so I just told them I'd go elsewhere as I had other offers at the price they had advertised (sort of true) - they ended up paying me £500 premium!
"Well actually I'm not concerned at all about the £2,000 just glad I swapped to a SQ5 when I did as it made the PX trade much sweeter and I probably would not have been able to afford it now if trying for the same PX+£ deal. That said I plan on keeping this car for at least 3-4 years so long term depreciation isn't my main concern. Realistically I can't see Audi compensating people like me if residual prices go down more than they should on SQ5's as it will be almost impossible to prove its because of the emission fiasco but hey sometimes miracles do happen!!"
"I am getting a lot of condensation build up on both front and rear screens,I can find no signs of damp in the car,no leaks,but I do have a pan roof fitted could this be an issue.I always have the air con on and I do not use recirc.Anyone else have this issue?Many thanks Rick"
"My Golf (no sunroof) was very bad with this, a new cabin pollen filter made a fair bit of difference. The old one didn't even look dirty but must have been damp. Damp leaves in the scuttles can also cause it.It's still not perfect so I bought a couple of dehumidifiers, just plastic boxes full of crystals which change colour when full, you plug them in to the mains to dry out and reuse. They work a lot better than the bags of crystals I tried before.I think VWs and a lot of Audis are affected by this, I couldn't find a definitive answer to solve it."
"No problem here. On the rare occasion that my windscreen gets fogged up, A/C + Front Defroster resolves it in short order."
"How much is ""a lot"" ?"
"Make sure the glass is clean as grease etc. will give the moisture to cling to. If it really bothers you, look at concealing some silica gel or similar in the car somewhere to absorb the moisture."
Mines the same as the floor mats get damp plus wet shoes and coats. A blast of ac sorts it plus degreasing the inside of the windscreen now and again...
"Hi SteveMak,Thanks for your reply, it really sounds like you love your 3.0 TDI and I'm not surprised driving around your beautiful part of the world!I will ask some questions about even bigger discounts when the car arrives (In I guess about a week) but I am trading in a specialist car which makes the deal a little different to a more straightforward trade in.CAP"
"Hi CapMine has also left the factory and is currently in transit somewhere, although I was worried about the latest scandal I decided to go with the 2.0 tfsi petrol as I really was not doing the mileage for a diseal engine.I never have driven a high up car view position car so it will be a first for me but I'm sure am looking to it. If the people comments are true to their words about the car performance and comforts etc, I will be one happy boy."
Font went all wrong but never mind
"Dont understand this ""Current market value"" . You sell your car anytime at current market value cant you?"
"My local BMW garage can't get a bid on my SQ5 at the moment because of the the uncertainty of the impending report regarding the emissions on the 3 ltr diesel, so it makes me wonder what the current market value is…..."
Put it in to webuyanycar - thats the market value/trade value of the car.They used current sales data to determine the true value. Not to be confused with forecourt price or private sale price.
"£34761 for a two month old SQ5 with 1500 miles and £6000 of extras - I paid £45000 and the car is a £51000 spec, so I think that tells the story of how the trade is valuing Audis at present. So if that's all VW would be talking about, then it's not much of a help is it? Guaranteed Future Value on its PCP after 4 years in £24000, so I would imagine that would present problems for Audi a little further down the line. I'm sure I've seen year old ones making over £40,000 on here in recent times"
"Gee thanks, you will buy my car back at current market value, which of course has been dragged down to its current levels by your cynical and deceiptful actions,Is it just me?"
"I think this will only be a problem for those who are thinking of selling in the near future as I think some outfits will not want to overpay for a VAG car at the moment and before the dust settles on the emission fiasco. I too have a £46,000 SQ5 from September but I do not plan of selling until at least 3 years down the line when hopefully things will have well settled down!!"
"But thats normal for brand new cars...you lose the VAT as soon as you turn the key and the extras add 0 value.High 40k forecourt price was a long while ago,but this allows for 10% costs and discounts, so its not apple to apples.Once you start arguing id guess you'd end up around 36/7k... sad thing is you could keep it until next year and still get around the same price. Wives 63 reg is listing at 33K and change..."
"http://listers.co.uk/Used/Cars/Audi/SQ5/Q5_Diesel_SQ5_Quattro/191191This one's a lesser spec than mine, and it's over £10,000 more - I know that it's a forecourt price and not a trade price, but I've never ever bought a car with such savage depreciation as this - most of the drop is down to the emissions scandal, and the trade's nervousness towards anything VAG at the moment is testament to that&#8230;.."

"Like i say, ours is still worth @33+K after nearly 3 years, you are rightly worried, but the data is not what you think.Its not a loss or drop until you sell, so you have a FGV its Audis problem don't worry - easy to say but...You are at the steep part of the curve. I can say I've seen and had worse.."
"My first Audi, so I've never experienced depreciation like this before. I had a 4 month old X5 stolen and lost £4000 off the new price, so the dealer gave me a £4000 discount off the replacement, so no extra cash to find. That's my only experience of short term depreciation, so you must excuse my naivety&#8230;.."
"Yes current SQ5 owners have every reason to be concerned about their hard earned cash but I feel sorry for all those who have ordered a SQ5 Plus at over £50,000 can't imagine what these will be worth when they arrive next year!!"
All scaremongering. End of the day if you are in the market for a quick SUV the emissions scandal really isn't going to put buyers off.
I have ordered a SQ5 Plus but I normally keep my cars for 5 years or so (current car 6 years) so I think it will all be forgotten by the time i come to sell
Yes that's he only way to ease deprecation especially if you are paying c£sh.
"Not sure of the best way to listen to music in the Q5I had the B&O in the A 5 and used a SDCard which was a lot of messing around on my Mac and iTunes .Also seems the easy option just to buy CD's , and is a pain with all the cases etc.Any thoughts would be appreciated ."
"Thanks RaphsterI haven't got a I phone , but the steaming seems a good idea.Could I use something similar which would do the same job?"
I have deezer on my iPadI assume I could Bluetooth it over to my car and the save it in the jukebox?
"You can bluetooth stream for sure, not transfer of save the files. You would need to do that on a PC and transfer via SD card / USB stick etc."
CrikeyMight just stick to buying and saving CD on the jukebox.
Might just stick to buying vinyl and playing on my record player at home.
"I stuck a 500GB hard drive in the glove box with all my music on, jukebox fairly small for storage."
"I stream audiobooks via Dropbox/iBooks, but you could also use Audible etc.Now that Apple have shifted audiobooks from the Music player to iBooks they don't get mixed up."
"The probplem with Q5 at the moment, it cannot read WAV files, only MP3 and some other lossy formats. Hopefully it gonna have a software update for that (just like TT model which play pretty much everything thrown at it)"
Download your music onto USB Stick and keep that attached via connector in glove box. Works for me.
"Thanks for all your help.I am now bluetoothing my music from an oldish iPod.Will this effect my use of the phone in any way?I am also thinking of getting the Audi connector from the glove box into my iPod, but it is the older wide type.ThankskZ"
I agree cannot see why any in car system these days cannot read FLAC or WAV.
"In my last car (BMW), I was able to ""jukebox"" my cds directly, but can't do this with the SQ5. Bought an iPod which does the trick for me."
"Can you help with this please.I have connected my iPod touch with my Audi lead in the glovebox and am trying to play my saved playlist through deezer.It comes up on the mmi as no music saved, and the volume seems to disableAny help would be appreciated"
Kzbaggie - use Bluetooth.Who uses wav files?
It seems to mess my hands free phone set up using Bluetooth
"Now playing my deezer playlist through my MMI, only problem I have is under functions, I can skip back to the previous track , but when I skip forward it defaults to my saved music on my iPod which I downloaded from iTunes.Any thoughts what might be causing this?I am using the Audi iPod lead in the gloveboxThanks"
"Not sure of the best way to listen to music in the Q5I had the B&O in the A 5 and used a SDCard which was a lot of messing around on my Mac and iTunes .Also seems the easy option just to buy CD's , and is a pain with all the cases etc.Any thoughts would be appreciated ."

"I am about to order a q5 and am torn between the 2l diesel with a few more options or the 3l diesel, either will be sline plus.Just wondered if anyone has real mpg figures. I do mainly motorway driving with some urban, about 18k miles per annum.Thanks in advance."
see herehttp://www.honestjohn.co.uk/realmpg/audi/q5-2008
"I am averaging 36mpg in the 2l s-tronic with a mixture of driving, but I tend to drive gently."
I'm getting 27mpg with heavy foot ????
"I am getting 33mpg average in SQ5 and have done 23k miles in 1 year with mainly motorway and A road driving.I always take 20% off combined figures and that tends to work out what I average. On my previous car a 3.0TDi A5 the combined MPG was around 50 and I averaged 40mpg. Same applied to previous cars I have had.So applying the same for the 2.0Tdi you are looking at around 37.5mpg and for the 3.0Tdi around 35mpg. Basically around £15 a month more for fuel on the 3.0Tdi but a lot more power, so its down to whether you would rather have a bit more go or a few more options!"
To get the same performance you would need to work 2.0 harder than 3.0TDI. Those who have changed have reported little difference in fuel consumption.
"Around 35 mpg with mostly easy motorway driving, nothing like as good as official figures"
3.0tdi 34 mpg over 12 months period mixed road driving 2012 model so the older engine newer ones supposed to do better
"Well I've just done my first commute to the office, mostly motorway and car showed an average of just over 44 mpg. Which I thought was pretty good. But I am treating my new toy with a lot of care."
"It would be if it were true but sadly the DIS lies its pants off, you will be doing an actual of 36 to 39 mpg...."
Mine is 5.5% optimistic so I would expect to see around 41 mpg if it's the same error as on mine.
"The SQ is 10-15% optimistic, I've never bettered 41mpg actual (the bulk of a 200mile round trip journey in 50mph motorway traffic) even though the DIS said 54mpg...I wish it did big smiley faces too, at least one could grin back at it...My RR Evoque experience was grim but I have to say that the fuel consumption calculations were uncannily accurate."
I reset after I brim the tank and find the DIS about 10% out..Shows 45mpg per tank..actual 38-42 depending on where I've been.
For that mpg you obviously haven't got Bristol traffic to contend with
No... My 50 mile round trip commute on quiet dual carriageways helps offset my 3 mile stop/start school runs..I'd imagine low 30's for a lot of town driving
"Welcome Aboard, looks like exceptional gains ????"
I get 26 to 40 on the motorway and the DIs is 5% optimistic
"I am about to order a q5 and am torn between the 2l diesel with a few more options or the 3l diesel, either will be sline plus.Just wondered if anyone has real mpg figures. I do mainly motorway driving with some urban, about 18k miles per annum.Thanks in advance."
"I have the 3.0tdi s-line plus 2014 model. Short journeys around town are around 25mpg, motorway cruises get over 40mpg. The thing I like about the bigger 3.0 engine is that it wafts along around town at just over 1000rpm most of the time and cruises at 80mph at around 2000rpm.Lovely engine and very quiet and refined!"
"Impressive ,that mite b a forum record ????"
"blimey, need to have a word with my right foot!1300 miles on the clock now. filled it up 3 times, so thats 433 miles to a tank on average!"
IanSQFIVE that is the new target to beat! Over what distance was that achieved?
that was over a 40 mile drive
Was that before or after the DTUK?
That sounds about rite ????
"That was after the DTUK boxI don't bother checking too often given the numbers aren't real anyway!You are probably right though, higher is possible"
"The 2.0l TDI also sits on exactly 2,000 rpm at 80mph.I test drove a couple of 3.0l models and was quite surprised to see the same revs at same speed."
Filled to brim after collecting car last week. Mixture of motorway and hilly short journeys (in Isle of Wight). Recorded 498 miles on the odometer. DIS showing 34.8mpg average. Refueled to brim total 67.9 litres.A after rounding off a few figures I calculated approx 33.5mpg from first tankfull.Oh mines a Q5 2ltr 190ps S-Tronic
"My calculations using your fuel and distance come to 33.42 MPG (Imperial), which is close enough to your figure. That works out to 27.83 MPG (US) or 8.4534 L/100km. If you go toFuelly.com, you can compare how your mileage number compare to other Q5s."
I always find the manufactures claimed MPG is about 10 MPG out ????
I used to find I would get within 5% of the official figures until they all found a way of making the official tests look way better than you could achieve in the real world.
"I am about to order a q5 and am torn between the 2l diesel with a few more options or the 3l diesel, either will be sline plus.Just wondered if anyone has real mpg figures. I do mainly motorway driving with some urban, about 18k miles per annum.Thanks in advance."
"Zen123, did you have a 177ps 2.0l model before this new 190ps you now have? Was just wondering if there's any noticeable difference in performance? Thanks."
"No, this is my first Q5"
I will be picking up a 190ps model in September so will be able to compare.
3400 miles traveled in my TDI SQ5 and fuel is improving tank by tank. Achieved 560 miles on the last tank which included mostly sensible driving (under 80 mph) and the odd boy racer challenge at the traffic lights. Getting better mpg in the SQ5 compared to my previous 2.0TFSi 211 A5 coupe. Well chuffed so far.
"Raphster, the computer-displayed fuel economy is notoriously inaccurate. To find out yourrealfuel economy: (1) Fill up, (2) Note your odometer, (3) Drive a bunch (complete tank preferably), (4) Fill up, noting how much fuel you added and your odometer reading, (5) Do the math to determine MPG or L/100 km.It's really easy to get impressive number on the display. It's an altogether different story to get impressive genuinely high fuel economy."
See my fuelly
"200 miles out of a £30 fill up,well hapi with that ????"
"Nope. I gave you the benefit of the doubt, believing you just did not know. Now it appears to me you're just trolling. Either way, this is the place for me to shrug my shoulders and go ""oh well."""
Covered just under 3000 miles and averaged 29.2 'real' MPG. Very happy with that.
I'm hoping this will be the next scandal to hit VAG and they get hammered for it.Its impossible to get near their published number in my experience.
And their 0-60s.....Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"It's actually impossible to get near any car manufacturers published 'official' figures as they are not tested in the real world. I'd suggest any car buyer should reduce (or increase for 0-60) the offfical figures by 20% and you might have an idea of real performance. That said, even at 20% less MPG and 20% more on the 0-60, I still love my car and it's still 100% better than plenty of other similar priced/specced cars on the road! IMO obviously. And an increase in emissions wouldn't have made the slightest difference to my choice of car."
"I am about to order a q5 and am torn between the 2l diesel with a few more options or the 3l diesel, either will be sline plus.Just wondered if anyone has real mpg figures. I do mainly motorway driving with some urban, about 18k miles per annum.Thanks in advance."
"Hi AllWhat are people REALLY getting regards MPG on their new SQ5 carsI know what the figures say but I never get them on any car I buy so was just after some HONEST mpg readings from current users on a day to day basis with normal driving usage not being care full and trying your hardest to get the best results, I just want to find out the real every day figurescheers LB"
"I've done 12382 miles in the last 18mths. Best mpg has been 33.82. Worst mpg has been 28.34. Average mpg 31.38 (calculated using litres used vs mileage covered, not the onboard computer)I hope that helps"
"When I had my SQ5 I did 22k miles and averaged 33mpg and that was calculated not by the dis. that was about 50% motorway, 30% A roads and 20% B roads and town."
"Go toFuelly.comand you can do a search, where you'll find real-world MPG reporting for the specific car and engine of your interest."
Real mpg over 1600 miles is 30mpg in my SQ5
"Averaged 37.9mpg over the first 2,350 miles on my 190ps ""ordinary"" Q5."
"SQ5 - real world fuel consumption is 28mpg for me. To be fair, it's only done 1500 miles, and hopefully it will improve, but this is nowhere near the 47.9mpg average that the brochure mentioned."
Q5 2.0 tdi 177ps after 6500 miles dis shows 29.9 mpg. Split driving town and dual carriage way daily commute to work. No where near the odficial figures from the brochure. I normally manually work out my mpg by the litres of fuel at full tank by the miles covered at fill up which work out at is 32mpg. The dis figures are abit off. Plus I normally only ever manage to fill up to a maximum of 69 litres out of the 75 litre tank. If I rinsed my Q5 dry of diesal then I'd say I would get 37mpg and no more. But I'd rather not take that risk bit of a risky experiment
"Calculate from full tank to full tank - it is much easier (and safer).Also, I have never known a DIS to be pessimistic. Seems strange."
I work out mileage from full to full as well using the amount of litres vs the trip. It's always lower than the dis but I wonder how accurate the odometer actually is.The speedo on my Golf in particular reads very high (when I test drove it I thought it was displaying KPH and got them to check it) so if the odometer is also reading high that would make the real world mpg figures even worse.I keep meaning to check it against a gps but have never got round to it.
"Fair point. I regularly do a 200 mile trip and the GPS ""miles to go"" matches up pretty well with miles travelled when I get to the destination."
"Just checked the brochure and it's the extra urban cycle that's 47.9 mpg, and the combined cycle is 42.8mpg. Still nowhere near though.I was just reading an article in the Daily Mail which was talking about a leaflet that new VAG owners are being given at the point of sale, which is basically saying the advertised CO2 and mpg figures can't be relied upon. Bizarre."
"I think all of the manufacturers are doing it - strength in numbers I guess.I has a couple of 2011 BMW X5s which advertised an average of 38mpg, and achieved 35mpg - when they bought the new model out, the combined cycle jumped to 48mpg - I thought this has got to be worth a test drive. Guess what? Still 35 mpg."
"Agreed, I've never had a pessimistic DIS/Trip Computer in any VAG vehicle although my Q5 is closer to the truth than any before but still optimistic."
"With all the recent emissions issues and varying other factors I have been considering moving away from Audi, however they have me by the proverbial short and curlys due to the fact I am around half way through my PCP agreement.Has anybody left before the end of their PCP term that can provide information on the process / cost / issues ect?"
If you have decided what you want to buy(?) go to the dealer of your choice and he will negotiate a settlement and trade in value for you.
you can call up audi finance and they will give you a settlement figure (automated line)you will get sent this by post to so you can take about with you.Wherever you trade in your car the dealer will pay the outstanding and you can confirm with audi finance. It is all very straightforward.If by chance you have just had a payment out in between times then you will get an additional rebate from Audi a week or so later automatically.
"But its a rental agreement, the thing is arranged in a way to pay off the car after a period, clearly if you want out early its going to cost money..It will get worse before getting better."
Good help - thanks guys.
"purephase said:Actually there's no financial penalty for paying off early with Audi Finance - the only reason to stick with an agreement to the end is if you KNOW that the market value of the car is going to be well under the GFV and you can hand it back - which virtually never happens (even with dieselgate the dealers will have given enough headroom to mean they can flip vehicles at a good profit. t's easy to get a quote online and then you or the dealer you are trading in through can just settle the difference.Obviously the more often you buy a new car the more money it costs you because the steepest depreciation is from new unless you're lucky enough to have a 911 GT3 - but that's the price of having shiny wheels!Click to expand...I never mention penalty...at all..The car has a value, you pay a deposit and a monthly payment, its a bell curve!If you are changing all the time the deposit is going to be thrown away as the first year is always the most expensive.. and you can be in negative equity easy. Things like the emissions problem with clear impact equity or value of all cars regardless of if its rented, financed or purchased."
"If you're half way through your finance payments and find that you are in negative equity on your car you can always voluntarily terminate your deal.You hand the car back regardless of mileage and the deal is ended, it will have no effect on your credit score is classed as a settled finance account, however a note can be added to your credit report so say that you did not complete a finance agreement, but if it's the first time you have done this it shouldn't be a problem arranging finance on a new vehicle, it's only if you've done it more than one it may start to raise eyebrows!"
@Snowman - agree you didn't say penalty - I was inferring that because you were talking about waiting until the end of your finance agreement. I think we are saying the same thing - it's expensive to trade in your car after a short period of time - regardless of how long your deal is for.
"This sounds great for me, but surely not for Audi - why would they do this? Is it only once you are halfway through the agreement?"

"Hi AllWill i get any sort of breakdown cover when i take delivery of my new SQ5 plusI ask as my RAC membership is due and when i got my land rover new in 2010 it came with 3 years land rover assist which was a full breakdown cover, just wondered if Audi did anything like thischeers LB"
3 years is standard .................
"oh thats good then, my wife gets nothing with her 62 plate bmw"
Also does it recover you home or does it take you to the nearest dealer if car cant be fixed by the roadside
3 year AA breakdown with all new audi's. Used audi's 1 year AA breakdown but if you get your car serviced via audi you continue to get a years membership until your next service
"Hi, From what I can make out every new SQ5 order appears to be for the Plus model or am I mistaken?"
"I ordered the PLUS model as I think its a better buy and I like the xtra bits you get, plus I think it will sell better in 3 years when I change again all in my own personal opinion off course"
"if you like the styling tweaks then it makes sense to order the Plus, IMO. Personally I'd probably still stick with the standard as I prefer the way it looks, but each to their own, and I'd take the extra power if it were available on the standard, although I can't see any obvious improvements in the numbers, it must be doing something. I'm looking forward to a new SQ5 coming through."
When she asked me what SQ stood for I told her that was a silly question.
"I had the opposite... when our Q5 turned up my wife asked where the S had gone (""Downgrading"" from an S5 to a Q5 due to poor baby seat/pram options in the back of the S5). Couldn't justify the extra £ at the time I ordered as the SQ5 was brand new with few discounts and the deal I got on a lowly 2.0 was a steal."
Does anyone bother to occasionally use super diesel in their SQ5? I think perhaps every third tankful may be worth it but opinions differ wildly.
"Nope, waste of money, forecourt marketing and no more."
"I agree overpriced,with no visible benefit. ????"
"I don't use either, but I do wonder if super diesel may keep the DPF filter cleaner for longer and thus reduce the number of re-generation cycles and possibly avoid the dreaded blocked DPF?"
"Of the 3 or 4 full fillups I have done so far, 1 was a full tank of the Super Shell diesel. Didnt really notice any difference."
Tuners have reported higher peak figures using BP Ultimate Diesel and the likes
I would say it feels a bit smoother with the super stuff. Plus I think the shell stuff is produced from gas rather than crude? So should be the smoothest or am I talking bollocks?
"SQ5BEASTY1 said:Diesel covered quite recently herehttp://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/22138-diesel-fuelI notice a difference using Shell V power with performance and mileage...But I am quite OCD and I notice a difference in my steering between comfort and dynamic when others don't!It is probably all in my headClick to expand...The emperors new clothes springs to mind ,lol ????"
Also don't bother.
Thanks for the info HampshireMush.Which would you say was better for your car:Running on Tesco diesel with the occasional full tank of Shell V Power.OrRunning on say Shell regular diesel constantly?
I have recently been trying the Shell V power (second tank full).I have noticed a small performance increase and the engine does feel smoother.Not sure it is worth the extra money at £1.30 / litre
"SQ5BEASTY1 said:Diesel covered quite recently herehttp://www.myaudiq5....138-diesel-fuelI notice a difference using Shell V power with performance and mileage...But I am quite OCD and I notice a difference in my steering between comfort and dynamic when others don't!It is probably all in my headClick to expand...I notice a massive difference in steering between dynamic and comfort, tightens it right up and a pleasure to drive instead of sloppy.Only thing that makes ADS slightly worth the money."

I used to always use 99 octane V Power unleaded for my 03'STI... It definitely made a difference with regards to performance & mpg...
"Make your own mind up but im totally with Hampshire !! Wouldnt use super market fuel unless i had no other choice,I've been to numerous conferences with the big fuel guys. They spend millions on r & d , tweaking the fuel and using various additive packs. How many additives do you think the supermarket use?.I just cant get my head around why a few pence extra a litre concerns people when your driving a 40 thousand pound plus car.The real benefits are in keeping things clean and efficient , resulting in power, economy and reliability !!"
Does anyone bother to occasionally use super diesel in their SQ5? I think perhaps every third tankful may be worth it but opinions differ wildly.
I useMillers Oils - Diesel Power Eco Max cost £10 and does 10 tanks full of fuel .don't know if it makes any difference but worth  £1 a tank if it helps to keep the engine cleaner in my mind.
"I use the super fuel, always have in all my cars, for all the difference in price. Makes me happier knowing im treating the car to the best thats out there. Its like when servicing it, you wouldnt put in cheap oil just because its cheaper, you put in the best to look after your engine. Well people who care about there cars do, cant speak for everyone else"
Old topic now but V-Power Diesel is down to around 1.19p at my local Shell garage. I will definitely use during the winter months as I don't do excessive mileage and when I visit France during the summer months I use their Super Diesel which last time I was there was around €1.17 which is around 90p a litre. Job done. My view is that not long ago diesel prices where around £1.36 a litre and we paid and that was that but now I think that £1.19 for V-Power is actually a bargain!! Crazy but true. Outside of all the hype surrounding V Power fuels I do think its probably more beneficial to high power diesel engines than standard diesel in the long term so I have no problem using it in my SQ5.
"Pls clarify what Super Diesel is. I am in the US and perhaps this diesel is available in Europe.What makes is ""super"", for example is its cetane higher than that for ""regular"" diesel?Thx"
its just got cleaning additives in. it has 0 performance benefits.The idea is a good one for older or huge milage engines but unless you hit around 50k you might as well throw the money in the bin.http://www.shell.co.uk/motorist/shell-fuels/shell-v-power-nitro-plus/shell-v-power-nitro-plus-diesel.html
All engines will be old one day so the better you treat them in the early days the better they treat you in the older days!!
"But who cares about a problem that might happen once you've sold it on?If you hit 50k, then start using it THEN..,"
But the gunk will have built up by then. Remember prevention is better than cure.
"OK, it's not diesel, but >"
Hello allI am looking to purchase an SQ5 after selling my much loved audi TTS.The big question I have though is what kind of discount could I expect to achieve on something like the car below?http://www.ebay.co.u...88AAOSwT5tWOrhaAny help would be gratefully appreciatedRegardsRichard
I would be expecting to pay £42/43k
"Apart from the fact they are asking way too much £ its has 20'' standard issue wheels which are very nice but when you are paying this sort of money you really really want the 21's!! You can probably spec up a brand new one with 21's and similar spec and get around 12% discount which will take you down to around £45,000 which will probably be the better deal but I'm guessing you are eager to get behind the wheel of an SQ5. Tread carefully......"
As above I would think you could perhaps spec new for cheaper but that may mean waiting until March. These pre-reg deals are always aimed at either the person who doesn't know what deals can be got on a new car or alternatively those who want a car asap.
OP might find this of interest?
"Or in my case make them feel so sorry for selling a car intended on purchasing...manage to get 13% off, full tank of fuel, mats and an iPhone 6 Apple lead...Saved the months waiting!"
Thanks for all your help guys - Audi offered me 1k off over the phone today but that was a good as they claim its going to get. My thoughts are that he needs to come down on the car to at least 45k to make it a wise purchase
"On another note, does anyone have experience of getting discount on pre registered cars - if so what amount are we looking at. Thanks again"
As above I got 13% on mine but it was registered as I purchased. Had done 21 miles
"Thank you Chaznik - I guess you think I should push for more than 1k off then? Whilst I want to get behind the wheel, I can wait till the right one comes up"
the £1k if your paying pcp is the dealer and finance contribution I expect
Might be a good exercise to get Audi to confirm in writing whether any new/existing SQ5 they are selling is affected by the emission scandal and if they will not commit then neither should you but if they do get it in writing and if it turns out that your car is affected contract it in that you get your mon£y back.. Play them at their own game.
"call Sam at ""What Car"" to get their 'Target Price', or try CarWow. do NOT accept just the List Price and any dealer / manufacturer contributions - go for max discount, i am on 13% at the moment."
Thank you rifleman - when you say call Sam at ''what car'' - can he disclose audi's bottom line?
"I got 12% for a plus (including 1k contribution) and choose to wait 3 months to have brand new.This favours even more for the standard sq5, you could probably get a decent spec new one for under 45k which is less than a lot of 5k mile second hand ones."
"How much discount? Well all the above under normal circumstances, and remember there's a new model Q5 later next year too (but not yet for SQ5). But and it's a big but (no that's the missus) what about the lack of confidence due to the emissions scandal? That has started to hit sales and who in their right mind would buy a new Audi at this moment in time without a massive discount (20%+)?"
If you are buying a used SQ5 I would be looking at say 40k for a 2014 car and maybe 42-43k for a 2015. More than that and it only really makes sense to buy a new car.As above the emissions scandal means the should be happy to see any customer through the door so I would exploit that. And the suggestion above about getting them to confirm in writing that any car you buy is not affected by NOx or CO2 scandals is excellent. If they are so sure then its easy to write a letter saying that and if they can't provide the answers then why are they selling the car??
"Feeling a bit gutted, I only got 9% on a plus."
We bought our Q5 from Aberdeen Audi and they had 3 SQ5 in stock at the weekend with about 10% discount plus a finance deal.
Hello allI am looking to purchase an SQ5 after selling my much loved audi TTS.The big question I have though is what kind of discount could I expect to achieve on something like the car below?http://www.ebay.co.u...88AAOSwT5tWOrhaAny help would be gratefully appreciatedRegardsRichard
"don't be, you were still smart enough not to pay the list price and saved yourself thousands."
I still don't know why anyone spends so much time and hassle dealing with salespeople at dealers. Try a broker and see how hassle free the whole experience is (and how easy it is to immediately achieve a great discount).
Go with Sepang.. Looks amazing and gets constant admiring glances.
"Have you, or anyone else, experience of using an Alko 3004 stabiliser hitch on an sq5 with factory tow bar so I can put my mind at rest?Started a new thread on this"
not here you didn't (i mean that nicely).
"Ah, it's in the info and spec section"
"I have not paid much more than that car for a SQ5 PLUS for March delivery with lots of extras tickedTread steady is my adviseEDITSorry missed your thread regards ordering new, nice spec well done and stick with sepang blue its a great eye catcher"
"Hi all,I originally ordered my Q5 2.0 TDI in Quartz Grey but then my family started giving doubts. So I contacted my dealer and although it was already production scheduled for first week in August managed to change colour to Lava Grey which we believe will suit the Q5 better.Has anyone got a Lava Grey car and confirm we have made a good choice?BrianH"
"In that link you can see several pictures of ""GRIS CUARZO"" and other colors, I hope thats help you to make your choicehttp://picasaweb.google.com/compraconjuntaq5/AlbumDelGrupoDeCompraConjuntaQ5#"
"its all subjective, make your own mind up and ignore the rest."
"I think you've made a good choice. Our Q5 is in Daytona grey and the dark shades definitely suit. We had an A4 in quartz grey and bored of it quite soon, a colleague currently has the same car in lava grey and it looks very nice. Good luck - it'll look great"
Picked up my Lava Grey Audi Friday. Love the colour. Looks great.
Lava Grey is absolutely my favourite colour. The most classy among non audii exclusive paints.
"Nice pics rifleman. I love the offroad style alloys - they are paired with Daytona grey on my current Q5. I always seem to end up going for grey in the end even with the best of intentions of choosing something different - my previous Audi was monsoon grey (which was lovely - with a slightly blue tinge in the right light), then Daytona grey Q5 and I've just bought a 2nd hand BMW which is in grey as well!"
50 shades of grey
Lava Grey..... all the way......
We've had our Lava SQ5 for nearly 2 months and absolutely love it. Very pleased with the choice!
"i love Lava Grey - but sadly i need to come away from it on my next Q5 otherwise it will look like i only changed the alloys and the grille and a few other options.Daytona Grey is my second favourite colour on thew Q5, and this is what i will go for."
"I had a lava grey A4, with dark titanium wheels and it looked good."
I'm heading to Munich in December for a 3 week Christmas holiday. I've never taken a car from the UK to the continent and would like to get some forum advice on preparing the Q5 for the trip. It's a 2015 model.Things I apparently need:Breathalyzer? Is this true?High vis jacketTriangle - one in car alreadyHeadlight adjustment - this used to be a sticker. Can you adjust the HL in the MMI? Or do I need to buy a whole lamp?Winter tires - I've got the tires that came with the Q5. I think all seasons. Are these legal? I'm headed for the Mountains on excursions from Munich. Last Christmas there was heavy snow.Anything else?Many thanks!James
It's a legal requirement to have a breathalyser in your car in France (minimum of 2).You can adjust lights via MMI setting.
Sorry didn't notice you mentioned France in the title in my previous post!Also as Raphster says - the headlamp converter is available via. the MMI - I drive in France at least twice a year and I've always used that. Never been stopped though so don't know if the gendarmes would take a dim view of my attempts to explain that I didn't need the stick on converters!
"Hi Purephase,Nice. I live in London. So I do have the option of going via Holland and skipping france altogether. What's your view on that? It's a little more out-of-the-way but it might be interesting to take the ferry instead of the tunnel. And driving through Holland would be cool. Are the French motorways so easy that it's not worth missing?Facinating about the breathalyzers!"
Crossing times to Holland are much longer though ..........Going Dover-Dunkirk is a good alternative to the Calais route but crossings are only every 2 hours
Drive in France all the time during the summer months. Motorways are great but expensive and the French drivers assume that if they are paying to use a road then the 130/110km speed restriction does not apply to them so they drive as fast as they want. My guess is that the police don't often bother patrolling the autoroutes just the route nationales which often have traps set up to spoil your day!! Oh I nearly forgot expect French drivers to sit on your tail as I think they get a bit lonely so need to feel close to someone!! Mad but true.
I read somewhere that if you decide to drive through France always switch off your Speed Camera detection setting on your SAT NAV. Assuiming you're using one that is.
Is the standard SatNav system in the Q5/SQ5 capable of recognising speed cameras in France or anywhere else?
"Ah, good point... I have an SE Q5 without SAT NAV included in the MMI. Anyone else?"
"Audi (and other manufacturer's) Sat Navs do not have ""safety"" camera locations identified on the maps. They only have the speed limits highlighted."
"TomTom and Gramin have changed ""speed camera"" locations in France to ""safety zones"" (or something similar) to get round this one..............."
"Latest Garmin & Tom Tom identify ""danger zones"" in France. No idea whether this is acceptable to the Gendarmerie?You are unlikely to get caught, but if you are good luck .......... Penalties can include fines of up to €1,500, confiscation of the device and of the vehicle."
"When is best to get rid of my SQ5? Never kept a car longer than 11 months but trying to this time around. I hear its around 2 yrs on pcp is best to get rid? Is this true or what is best? Or does it depend on what i go for next etc? Ive traded and sold cars for ten yrs owning over 25 cars. Didnt really care about losing out before but now i do , as looking to keep upgrading each time i want the best money i can get at the right time for the car.Thanks in advance"
Normally 18months to 24months is the best time Ifind.imon my 3rd pcp and have never had to put any money towards my new car if anything my payments had gone down.
Ok what kind of deposit did you put down to start with?
I put down an initial 8.5k deposit. This was a few years back. Never had to top up
my payments on pop went up
"I use car wow get a few quotes from different dealers and then present the lowest to the dealer where I purchased my car from. Instant reduction in payments and I even managed to squeeze in a free add on option as it was their end of month and they seemed desperate to seal the deal.i had their audi quottro thrown in free which is smart repairs, tyre insurance, gap and key protection all for 270.00 p/mThings maybe different next year when I look to upgrade with this whole scandal. Not entirely sure if I'll get a good trade in price or what audi will do to entice me to keep my business with them. We shall see"
"my dealer said their 'loyalty software' had indicated that now was the right time in my PCP plan to look to upgrade - my Q5 is 25 months old with 28,000 miles on the clock.i'm getting about 13.7% loyalty (and disgruntled Audi Emissions Scandal victim) discount, but i still need to fork out £3000 on another deposit to keep the monthly payments the same.sound about right?"
"I'm confused, how can it be 3k for 2 years?You have the original deposit, the monthly payments and the new deposit of 3k..."
"How much deposit did you stick in originally? Sounds a bit steep to me, unless your new car is of much greater value than the previous one, in which case you'd expect a little more input needed."
Yes it's very steep. Most dealers have a loyalty scheme designed to retain their pcp customers. Firstly you'd have equity in your car secondly the difference to keep your payments the same is usually given in the form of a loyalty dealer contribution. This helps pcp customers get into new cars long as it's of the same class. Obviously if you go for a higher spec model then you'd need to top up your deposit to get your payments to where they need to be.Sounds like your dealer isn't offering you a good deal.
"I specced my SQ5 to 51 k od, put down 12k, so hopin i have money init in 18-24 month, as want to upgrade heavily toan RS6 or B9 RS4, so fi gers crossed"
"I'm in a similar position. I chucked in a large deposit so I know I will have equity, and I'm also hoping that the new RS4 will be good timing for me."
"Yeh i had the money sitting anyway, i was going to put more but then thought pcp becomes pointless if i start sticking in 25 od, then im just aswell HP it. So 12 seemed a good number an got my monthlys at a descent number to. And luke you i was speculating of the cars coming out in a couple years, one being the RS4 hopefully. Hopefully its been out 6 months or so so i can start getting deals on thembut i think they will be well sot after cars"
"this is why i need to put this out there and talk to you guys - if you know a way i can avoid a few grand deposit every couple of years then please let me know how you do it, thanks."
"Dermu said:Firstly I shop around near the 18months mark. I also call up audi finance to get a settlement figure so thst i know what I'm working with. I look on audi's used car locator to see what similar spec, age and mileage is going for. I get a valuation from cap. Do all the homework myself which only takes about 30 minutes. (Gfv - cap valuation = equity) but audi normally chuck in on top lots of loyalty bonuses. When I talk to dealers they know I've done my homework and they can't pull the wool on me. I keep everything email or via carwow.Lastly I use car wow to get pcp quotes from several dealers. I contact the one who is offering the lowest payments and then tell them that I have a trade in.I tell the dealer that if they can lower my payments I'm happy to go with them. The way I see it is that they have targets to meet tgdy need my business and they not having my hard earned dosh unless they work for it by making the deal in my favour. I also have ford RS moved from an ST deposit free and lowered my payments by 30 quid. You can make it happen. Don't show desperation and be blunt and tell them this is what I want go make it happen go speak to your boss. You don't ask you don't get.Click to expand...Great advice thanks Demru. I've already done most of the above and when I mentioned doing a straight swap both my original dealer 40 miles away and my local dealer just laughed and said this just does not happen. Perhaps my monthly payments are too low - after paying nearly £11K Deposit I pay £345 per month?I had a dream of being able to upgrade my car for less of a deposit - but that seems to have gone out the window."
On a 11k deposit you are paying a reasonable monthlyrental.ifboth your dealers laughed saying that this doesn't happen then maybe you need to contact different dealers. As I mentioned carwow is faultless. The dealers contact you you don't do anything but submit an initial enquiry. When I upgraded my st for RS I bought from a dealer that was 490 miles away from me. They did a free mationwide delivery. There are dealers out there that will bend over backwards to put together a deal just not maybe the ones you been dealing with.
"I agree with you there, where i live up north east of scotland, which most know a big majority work in oil or are related somehow, so RS models and expensive models go out at aberdeen daily, so by travelling to dundee say the difference in the dealer is huge. Aberdeen give a good trade price but there attitude sometimes compared with dundee etc is crazy.Saying that ill shop around with car wow as i do aswell and present my dealer with the quotes from them and try get them near as dammit to it"
Let me know how you get on. Good luck.
"When is best to get rid of my SQ5? Never kept a car longer than 11 months but trying to this time around. I hear its around 2 yrs on pcp is best to get rid? Is this true or what is best?

"thanks guys, i ran my deal past WhatCar (who found the best deal on my current Q5) and they said they couldn;t beat it.i'll try CarWow and see what happens and let you know, thank you so much."
"purephase said:Hi Rifleman. I think this is similar to your question on the GFV you had a while back.I think Dermu is bang on - you need to arm yourself with the key financial facts before you talk to your dealer, and know exactly what these mean in terms of whether what they offer you meets your financial goals or not.My experience is that dealers will try and talk to you in terms of deposits and monthly payments - concealing things like the actual ticket price they are charging for the car (i.e. the discount), the balloon payment and ultimately the interest rate unless you specifically ask. Sure they will be on the document you sign but by that stage the deal is done.Regarding your actual trade in position - I don't think it's possible to judge whether it's good or bad without all the details - it does strike me that you've put decent miles on the car for something around 2 years old - and that's obviously going to count against you.Click to expand...cheers purephase,i listed the figures previously on here elsewhere - i'll find them again and put them up to see and you can have a better picture.14K miles per year isn't excessive at all - is it?"
I always set my mileage limit at 6000 even though I do around 11000. Long as you not handing the car back to the finance company then the dealer doesn't care how many miles youcover.longas you keeping business on the books with them. As with the Q5 the demand is there even with the scandal it's still a very desirable car. The used car market is very good for all the Q's with top trim levels not the crappy se's
Aren't they offering you a dealer contribution? I got 2.5k from audi that would of set against the extra you would have to pay?
How much did you have to pay extra for the blackpack?
£425 - this was a good will gesture by them after i harranged them about the emissions scandal etc.
"Hi rifleman...I think you said that you had a balloon payment of £21,800 in a previous post - if I assume a fairly standard IR of 6.3% from Audi Finance that means your dealer is giving you a little over £4k in equity for your trade-in. I don't know if that sounds reasonable to you given the value of the vehicle you are handing back."
"rifleman said:hi purephase,the £21K figure was for the new Q5 i haven't yet purchased, the figure for my current Q5 was an £18K figure and the dealer has stated i have £5500 equity on my current Q5.i note the APR is actually 6.4% now.having had p[lenty of quotes back from carWow - none are inthe double figues and don;t even come close to the 13% offered by my current dealer, so i still cannot figure out how it is possible to just swap your car without laying down any deposit.for me to get a new Q5 of exact same spec as my current Q5 i have to pay £3300, with the extras i want to bolt onto a new Q5 that becomes a deposit of £4800 in order to keep the monthly payments the same.any ideas?Click to expand...Did you ask your dealer of they are offering a dealership contribution for taking out a pcp? I don't know how my dealer does it but I've never had to put my hands in my pocket both with audi and ford. Just FYI I Bought from spire m25 audi"
You can see this on the Audi web page. all offers will be listed in the finance section.Currently saying 1k.
What trim level is your Q5?
"check my signature block:Q5 (MY14) S-Line Plus 2.0 S-Tronic, ordered 15 May 2013 - confirmed now as a ""Build Week 35 Vehicle"" with a creation date in the week beginning 26 Aug 13 -delivered 19 Sept 13Lava Grey, Off Road Alloys, Panoramic Sunroof, Audi Phone Connect (High) - (with HTC One M8), Flat Bottom 3 Spoke Steering Wheel, Fine Napa Leather Front and Rear Heated Seats, Hill Hold Assist, High Beam Assist, Light Pack, Storage Pack, Folding Door Mirrors."
i challenged my dealer on this - he said £500 comes from Audi and £500 from the dealer.
Does your deposit include the deduction of the 1k?You have a lot of options included that must be over 1500. Where as mine is just a bog standard sline plus.Sorry m8 my phone doesn't allow me to see signatures don't know why.
yes - the deposit i pay includes the £1000 from Audi (i mean the £1000 comes off price of the vehicle) - the deposit i stated is what i will actually have to pay - which brings the discount to just over 13%.don't buy bog standard - add flat bottom steering wheel and hill hold assist at a minimum.
"When is best to get rid of my SQ5? Never kept a car longer than 11 months but trying to this time around. I hear its around 2 yrs on pcp is best to get rid? Is this true or what is best?

Then I guess you are just paying mostly for the extras which is acceptable. I was contemplating on adding the flat bottom steering wheel but I missed the boat oh well next year's upgrade!!
"Time to move on after 20 months of SQ5 ownership.Really enjoyed the car & would keep it, if I could justify shipping it abroad!About to let it go a dealer for probably under market value, so if anyone wants to grab a bargain, take a look in the classifieds.Thanks to everyone on here who helped me spec up this SQ5 about 2 years ago.Cheers, James"
"So big question, buy a run out SQ5 Plus or wait till 2017 for the new one?Discuss! ????"
"Buy something else, IMHO the Plus is a cynical gouging attempt by Audi have a last grasp at some Q5 sales, its not even particularly tasteful in execution, disappointing.Given that the new TT and Q7 have really upped the stakes in the interior technology department, especially the dash the current Q5 is going to look really ancient when the next generation appears so the Plus will just get a panning."
Q7
"I don't like the new front of the Q7 or the TT, much prefer the rounder current Q5 version, so I would go for current."
"I would get a normal SQ5 (wouldn't bother with the Plus, unless the differences are really your thing). Not sure about waiting for the next model either. The interior will definitely be better than current, the exterior will be similar to the new Q7 - if you like that?"
wait for 2017
I have been planning on getting the Macaw plus but am tempted to fully spec out an SQ5 and order sooner rather than later. Pretty good discounts on the SQ5 and Macaw is £58k with no extras...Not a fan of the new Q7 look so sprint be rushing to get it in a smaller Version aka Q5
"Go for the SQ5, I don't like the boy racer Plus and life is too short to wait until 2017."
"I went for the plus and with side runner bars and it looks so cool, the extra costs for SQ5 doesn't seem worth it."
shibli - are you referring to an Sline Plus?
"Personally I can't see the extra for the Plus model is worth it. Bit more power yes but it really doesn't lack power, rest of the changes are cosmetic but at a cost of a few thousand pounds. I would stick with a regular SQ5 or a used one as the run out of any models suffer a heavier depreciation hit as the new one will be around when you are selling. Only way to help that is to get a mega discount on the Plus but that seems unlikely."
I agree that will look awesome. I would have gone for this if available earlier this year.
"Save yourself the money and paint the wheels yourself. . . Cost maybe 300-500 but worth it.I agree i cant wait for thr B9 RS4 to come, rumour mill has it there is a saloon coming out again, although i love the avant anyway so woudlnt mind if it didnt"
"See your point about the wheels but a good second hand one is 45-50k anyway!!I can get a very high to my exact spec plus with discount @ total £52k which has the extra power, black accents, sports Diff and brand new smell lol"
"Id probably go for it aswell, it slightly tempts me, but im hanging out for the B9 hopefully around just less than 2 years so should be the right time to swap out the SQ with good money left in it, well again it should be but i put alot of spec which i know ill never get back but it should help a bitBite the bullet and go for it.What spec is your RS4?"
We use the SQ daily and its great for that. Id like a shot of a plus to see the difference but dont think it would be much. Im away to stick on 22's after winter and lower it so im happy in the fact i know mine will look better than the plus as standard as it already looks the same with what ive done to it. Might get a tuning boxThough so that i dont have one over take me haha
I've not read any B9 rumours yet.. Are there significant changes mooted?
"So big question, buy a run out SQ5 Plus or wait till 2017 for the new one?Discuss! ????"
"All i have really seen is that obviously the V8 is away being replaced with the bi turbo V6 engine by the sounds of things. Also rumours of the saloon coming back. Other than that not much, but as they say the new S4 is a cracker probably the best one yet, so imagine the RS"
"Must admit that I've pondered this - but have bitten the REALLY big bullet and ordered a RS6 Avant!!!!Will miss the SQ5, admit that the step is massive but couldn't wait.Enjoyed the forum, thanks for all the really useful hints/tips!!!!"
"Id love a 6, maybe in a yr or so ill think about one"
"It wont fill your void i dont think, i battle with keeping it on a weekly basis, but i try to remeber how good of performance im getting for such little money, IE fuel economy and monthly cost, as i put down a big deposit"
Audi should just make good cars and not worry about the RS and S labels on every range.Get/let the RS division to do their own thing and do the wow cars not the ones marketing want to sell.Rant over.
Can't get away with RSQ3. Looks awful.
"Id set fire to an RSQ3 if it was on my driveway so that i could get the insurance money to buy something else. In my opinion there a horribel car, good engine stolen from the great RS3, but the rest of the car is very bad"
"J1SGOI've had my SQ5 19 months, really like it and I'll miss it - particularly when seem to be constantly filling the RS up all the time!!!!"
"Gives you time to look at it more as you stand at the pump!SQ's and the RSQ3 are just too tame and feminine to use as a daily drives.Last time i was offered one with the 8k or so contribution offers and huge discounts on top of the RS6, you just cant go wrong.Screw the fuel.."
I was looking last night ad they seem to be giving about 13.5% off the RS6 = WINNER
"I built up an Rs6 to my spec a few months back and it came to 89k, even with 13.5% that's still 78k!!Slightly different price bracket to the 51k SQ to be fair lol"
"Yeah but then take off the 8k or so contribution and you are at 70k.OK, agree much more than an SQ, but.... more of a car too."
"huh?? I don't consider the SQ to look even remotely feminine. It's hardly a TT or a mini convertible is it?...and you have to be somewhat snooty to call it tame. Whilst it is not an RS6 by any stretch, it still pounds 95% of cars into the dust in any circumstance, straight line, top end etc.. And it sounds good.. Yes the RS6 is an amazing car, yes I'd love one, (but can't justify it right now).. But I've never heard anyone comment that the SQ is a woman's car."
"Got to agree with you there. The SQ dusts most cars out there, ive ha many young boy racers in cars thinkin they can dust the family wagon only to be left in the distance.Its not a woman car atall, the Q3 yeh maybe but even the 2.0 tdi Q5 isnt a womans car. Strange comment in my eyes.As for being to tame, a 4x4 that goes to 60 in around 5 seconds is that what we call tame? And as for looks that to me is doen to us to modify our cars to suit our one style"
Snow Man: shouldn't you be on a more masculine R8 forum somewhere puffing your chest out?
"So big question, buy a run out SQ5 Plus or wait till 2017 for the new one?Discuss! ????"
"Haha that can be said for every car in my town then, as 90% of people work away so there cars are driven by you guessed it there wife, range rovers, porsches, ferarris, nissan gtr's, merc GL/ML, need i go on.All these cars cars are driven by woman half the year but bought by the men/husbandId say an R8 is more a female car than most audis"
I have yet to see an SQ5 being driven by a woman....I've seen a half a dozen lately
"My wife does she is 24, and a few here the wifes drive but there not there cars"
I only see women driving Q5s period.I don't recall the last time i saw a man in one... except me..
"It was 6.4, then it was 5.4 with revs at 5k turbo hot... 40kg for the fuel and 1/3second, no chance. I'd have to remove the doors, boot lid, hood, the trim to get near that. Normal lights, you'll be hitting 6.0 at BEST...Plus model, I'd say will/could/should hit 5.1, with the extra power SQ doesn't and no one has managed to do it in the last 3 years..Best i got was around 5.5 with real timing and no fuel and full launch. I might try it again tomorrow before going for tyres!The SQ excels at motorway speeds with the Nms and very low revs in 8th."
"Couldnt agree with you more swingking, only other car i thought about was the macan turbo, but waiting two years wasnt for me haha, id want something else by then for sure. Ive had a range rover and discovery 4 both HSE the only thing thry had better was space, ither than that hand down SQ5 wins, economy performace quality"
"Im keen on an SQ7 if it ever comes out, if not RS4 or RS6 for me"
A B9 RS4 could really tempt me in 2017.
"There's now 4 SQs @ my gym and every single one is driven by men,just chucking that out there lol ????"
"Our town and local atea has around 12, all men, wifes do drive them but all the mens cars."
"There are 259 at my golf club, all driven by big hairy men with tattoos on their eyeballs and piercings in their tonsils. I've informed them they have a woman's car.."
Are they all cross dressers?IT even comes with a tampon store!Some seriously gender confused people around. You'll be wearing yoga pants when driving soon..
Sorry yes slide plus
Never seen a female SQ5 driver.Only seen a few female Q5 drivers and most of them are even male.
"So big question, buy a run out SQ5 Plus or wait till 2017 for the new one?Discuss! ????"
Lol Snowman exist on here to troll SQ5 ownersAnd you guys bite everytime
"For many people, a car that can easily hit 0-60 in under 6 seconds, and go on to reach over 150mph, IS a sports car, even if it isn't on rails or hasn't got the out and out power of a 'true' sports car like a 911 or R8 (big deal). your opinion about what is 'fact' and being predominantly driven by women, does not appear to have attracted much support. You're entitled to an opinion, but you're confusing your opinion with 'fact'. I bought what was IN MY OPINION a very quick 4x4/family car, with good economy and adequate space. I love it. Does exactly what is said on the tin. I think we need the Snow Man official list of what can and cannot be classified as a sports car, just in case we get confused."
Between the hours of 0900-1800 Monday to Friday most cars in supermarket car parks are driven by retired men/woman or just woman. That goes for all cars whether they are SQ5's or Range Rovers etc.. To label the SQ5 a womans' car is silly as it applies to all cars and normally the more expensive they are the more likely a woman is driving during the day.
"Im going to test my 0-60 to see for myself, as likes of the RS3 were faster 0-60 than stated times by audi. R8's are girl card in the super car world in my opinion but again just an opinion.Snowman seems to be god, everything he says is ""fact"" or in his eyes definately right! Got to love a know it all, makes my day haha"
"At what point did i mention it was a sports car??? Never once, ive owned many proper sports cars, i know what the SQ5 is, but you try to point it out as a girls car, or say that audi say its a girls car but in reality its mostly bought by guys. That seems more fact to me. I can only go by the people that i know who have a Q5 throughout the whole range, and all men. Not to sound harsh but i dont know a woman that can afford one round our parts, and again thats not to sound like a dick towards woman, just the way it is here"
"Hardly sexist, i was pointing out how it is where i live, which obviously you wouldnt know. So you cant comment on that or is that something you know everything about.And in your comment wher is the part that woman buy them more than men? I dont seem to see that bit. F**king keyboard legend you are, get a life haha, trolling the net for arguements back ""quoting"" everyone, ill give you my hairdressers numbers she had a Q3 maybe she could give you a new one liner"
"Read back, i never called you a troll, so again good facts by youwell done.The comments werent sexist they pointed out about the woman where i live who drive the car, not pointing the finger at every woman in the world, so stop trying to stir shit and get your facts straight. No wonder forums get abuse because of idiots like you"
"SQ5.. 2017 may bring something amazing, but then again, by then do you wait until 2020? maybe VW group will have recovered enough to have a bit of cash available for new models, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.."
Yep wait and get the Gen2 assuming they are in business still.
"I would definitely be up to challenge that statistic! 50% of Q5's are bought by women? And you believe that is accurate? After all, Audi wouldn't tell a lie... If my Emojoi thing's worked there would be a laughing face whistling!Pretty sure this thread is to do with SQ5's, of which what percentage are BOUGHT by women? And you're saying the SQ5 is feminine and that the target demographic is female?"
"Gents/LadiesMaybe we should have a separate thread regarding how feminine the SQ5 is? IMHO, Your off thread comments are detracting from this thread. But that said, I drive an SQ5 and a SL55, so obviously don't give a toss whether some stranger on a forum thinks i am driving a 'girls car' or not!Please can we get back on thread?"
"Several key points made above that are in fact 'back on topic', but point taken. Threads rarely last this long without deviation...."
"So big question, buy a run out SQ5 Plus or wait till 2017 for the new one?Discuss! ????"
"Morning all,My 15 plate SQ5 is running the DPF regeneration cycle everytime I use the car, is this something I should contact Audi about?It has only started doing this over the last month or so, I have only ever used BP ultimate diesel or Shell V power but, have been using Sainsbury's standard diesel recently. Could this be the cause of the constant DPF regen?Thanks in advance for your help and support."
"it runs pretty regular, its more than likely doing it over and over because its not completing.Go for an extended motorway drive so as to allow it to complete.This is normal."
"Thanks for your swift response snowman. The car has been used a lot in slow traffic recently so, a spirited drive on the motorway may cure the problem.Thanks again."
"Does anyone know where I can source a set of 255/40/21 Dunlops for the SQ5?Will shortly need new ones on all four corners but can't find stock anywhere: I have tried main Audi dealers, the usual Kwit Fits etc, Oponeo, Black Circles, Asda tyres etc etc. but none available anywhere.Current set have worn very well so I would prefer to stick with the same make, but am being advised lead times of about 8 - 10 weeks for a new set.Other option is the Pirelli P Zero - £180 per tyre fitted - which seems pretty reasonable, but I'm a bit concerned about previous threads on here re quick wearing and, based on past experience, I don't like the Conti's either.Cheers for any steers."

Like you I have Dunlops and want to replace with those again when the time comes.
Try this onehttp://www.event-tyres.co.uk
could trytyresonthedrive.comnot sure what stock they have but had some tyres fitted to my wife's car today and service was very good.
"If it was my hard earned cash I would be replacing with Continental contisportcontact 5's, excellent handling in all weather conditions & superb mileage, I have achieved 20k plus on the rear of my Merc."
"Got a place in Maidstone Kent ,dunlops £190 fitted ????"
"Thanks all.Jules - Mytyres did seem to have 4 in stock but a £300 price differential between those and the Pirellis (for four tyres), means I've gone with the P Zero's.SQ-Beast - cheers - would have been tempted but Maidstone is too far from me in Warwickshire!Pirellis being fitted today so I'll let you know how I get on. They'll only be on the car for a few weeks before switching to my trusty Winters for the season anyway."
Replaced 2 fronts £205ea today.
"Remember there's a new look Q5 next year (not SQ5 though) with more tech and efficiency (not that you SQ5'ers look particularly for the latter!). To buy a Q5/SQ5 new now, without at least 10-12% discount on the full price (incl accessories) would seem unwise. Brokers are your best bet and used successfully by many on here, with those discounts, and at a time without a new model just around the corner...."
Are you getting Tech pack on the SQ5 Plus?
"What is tech pack, didn't see that on the configurator, maybe thats on the plus anyway?"
Are you getting 9.2% on the SQ5 PLUS or the standard SQ5? Will be surprised if any big discounts are available on the Plus as the car isn't on the road yet?
Not going for advanced key?
"I read a few scary stories about advance key on the RS246 forum, not sure if they were all true its put me off TBC."
If somebody is keen to nick the car it's better they do it on the drive than kick the door in IMO! Lol
Can you please expand on what this does / how it works? I thought the Q5 monitors tyre pressure as standard? By measuring the difference in rolling distance/speed of each wheel via ABS unit. When it changes (tyre loses pressure) you get a dash warning?
"j1sgo said:Hi All,My first post on this forum and I am looking to make the above change, I am a dedicated RS fan but as I have access to work cars and don't drive it much it just seems a waste having an RS being driven around like a nanny by the wife lol. Fantastic car but guzzles fuel, I feel that the sq5 could be the perfect compromise for us and would certainly make more sense fuel wise.I have a normal SQ5 test drive this Saturday and could end up placing an order if my dealer can get the numbers right and I can persuade myself away from another RS lol.Just wondering if anyone else has ordered a plus and what discounts/delivery dates they got?

Other than that , speed is great, fuel is magic, ride is good, handling good, interior is nice with extras like carbon atlas etc, i specced to 53k with the standard one and its been worth every penny so far. Done 8k and not missed a beat, i was going for the RS4 but the wife moans about fuel sometimes so the SQ was a perfect compramise"
"Realise not everyone agrees with this, but I am so glad I went for 21"" wheels. Last weekend I was parked in a large shopping centre car park, and not 3 cars away was an identical (colour and model) SQ but with 20"" wheels. Did not look as special. My wife took some convincing that it was in fact identical other than wheels. Her comment was "" Why pay all that money for a car that looks ordinary?""Hope this doesn't upset 20"" owners, but I had to 100% agree. The ride IMO is identical. The extra inch and minutely less rubber has almost zero impact, but the look is transformed.. But, just my opinion."
You'll regret the change from an RS to the SQ5....!12% discount for sure.

"Go for 12%, you wont have an issue getting it."
"DTD will not email you a quote, you can't even print your quote from the page, I screened shot the page with my IPhone then emailed to my dealership, happy days, 12% is obtainable for sure."

"Well done, don't forget to cancel your PCP within 14 days of collecting your car if you intend to clear your finance."
How do you mean?
Credit agreement cooling off period.
"Pay Off the PCP within the 14 day cooling off period you still keep your extra 1k discount, I shall be doing the same, happy days í ½í¸"
So pay off what your owe on pcp over the three yes within 14 days then? Sorry in just confused as ive never heard this one
"Yes, you get 'extra' discounts or contributions for PCPs,But if you pay off the credit agreement within 14days you dont give back the extra contribution provided..Clearly this assumes you have the ""cash"" to do so, which most people don't as thats the reason they are going PCP in the first place.Its just a nice trick if you are paying or have the cash to pay for a car."
Clever ill do that with the next car then
"Hi 18kny sorry for any confusion, I intend to pay cash for my Q5 however by taking out PCP I was offered an additional £1000 discount incentive, so the plan is after taking delivery of my car I will pay off the PCP loan in full keeping the £1000 discount, this has to be done within the 14 day cooling off period."
"No i got you jules, sounds like a good plan for me for next time"
"Hi guys,I'm wondering what you guys do in the UK. I live in Stockholm, Sweden. A lot of nice cars are stolen and shipped over to Estonia and then to Russia.I've spoken to my insurance company and they refuse to insure some cars unless they have a GPS Tracker mounted. I'm looking to buy one, mayby not to ease my mind but then I've done what I can to protect the car. I've also got smart DNA. I guess you don't have the same problem. I mean where would the ship the cars, Ireland?Regards Peter"
"Cars are stolen to order and shipped to Eastern Europe (and elsewhere) from UK too.If your insurance company insist on a tracker, you might want to find another insurer?"
"They don't insist that I get one, however they don't insure BMW X5 & X6 without one. Them Russians love big beemers."
Today I waxed my Panther Black SQ5 using Bilt Hamber Double Speed Wax. Looks great but how often should I use seems that 3-4 times a year is normal but wondered if more often would give greater benefits?Thanks.
Depends on how long your particular products lasts and needs to be topped up.I apply top up products to compliment a protective coating (not wax) after every wash which is every 2-4 weeks or so.YouTube has tonnes of info. Try searching Ammo or Chemical Guys etc etc
Try not to do it more than once a day or you'll start chafing.
"Why wax? Get your car detailed and have a specialist paint sealer applied (Gyeon Q2, Nanolex Ultra, GTechiq, etc) and you'll have a durable protective, water beading finish for a year or more (depending on product). Then after every other wash just use a detail spray (for either wet or dry paintwork)...simples!"
"I use Auto Finesse Tough Coat on my white SQ5, once a year is often enough. But black cars look great when waxed, I wax my black car three times a year, I would do it once a season if I had the time."
Thanks I do prefer to clean/wax myself and will probably wax around 3-4 times per year. The recent waxing should get me through winter so will reapply early next year. Having said that would it help if I rewaxed when I next wash say 3 weeks time which will give it an extra coat for winter?
"I had my A5 glymed , but not sure weather to bother with the Q5 as I am not sure I could really tell any difference"
Contacted Bilt Hamber and asked them how often I should use their DOUBLE SPEED WAX and they said every 6 months or maybe upto 1 year. Was probably going to use more often what do you think?
I am not sure double speed wax is right for your car. i thing you need their more upmarket products like finis wax which I use. I also thing 3 months between waxing is long enough. Ask Bilt Hamber again. i do like their products.
I reckon it's worth £36/£37k
"The warranty should be a strong attraction to a private buyer, maybe not worth a lot of extra cash but may attract someone. Having said that there aren't a lot of people spending that money on a private purchase as they may need finance or trade in. To that extend I gave often sold my cars through a prestige used dealer who markets the car on my behalf. No risk for him so I can be returned more than a trade price. My last car was an X5 that I was being offered 18 to 18.5k, sold it the way I mentioned and got 22k, dealer sold it for 24k so it was easy money for him but likely even more for me than I would have got privately."
"Trade-in price is spot on for now, so i believe its a good offer."
If that's an Audi dealer's price and you are not purchasing from them then fair enough. You mentioned 'trade-in' but didn't mention what you were trading in for or what discount you were getting. I think it's best to look at the whole deal before considering what's a fair price.
"yeh sure i know its the cost to change and im on a 15% discount off the new car from the same dealer plus this trade in value so im happy with the package but if i could get a few extra k from mine before then it might be worth it.Sold private in the 20-30k bracket before, tried once in the 30k+ bracket but as said above much harder."
What car are you getting 15% discount on?
RS6
"Nice car, my m8 has one."
"Its a fair/above current ""trade price"" for an SQ5 of that age mileage.Deal price is something completely different as they can ""change"" or move any of the numbers to make the deal happen..."
Think that's exactly the point he was making!
I think £37k ????
Well lets give it a shot see what happens on Autotrader now.
Now sold
Nice... AND Quick....What did you sell at?Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
I should qualify this and state i have taken a deposit from trade - exchanging week today.£35k which im very happy aboutwas always skeptical about being able to sell private - expected and received several trade inquiries.At this price to sell private you have to be lucky i think and i didnt have the luxury of being able to list it and just wait for a private buyer.I have a Hatchbag bootliner for sale now and some rubber front mats if anyone is interested?
Well done. That went quickly.
"Just wondering whether others shift to neutral at red lights etc?On traditional torque converters I would just leave the car is drive throughout, but the user manual seems to suggest that the car should return to neutral when stopped.Does leaving it in drive when stationery significantly wear the clutch?Thanks Mark"

"good question Steve,I was about to ask same about 2Lfrom an independent I got quoted less than £500 form all 4 corners disks and pads,"
"I would stick with OME unless you have a good reason to change, e.g. if you want to upgrade? Saving money on brake components is not a consideration for me.Audi do have a price match."
Has anyone tried ceramic pads. I have heard that the brake dust is greatly reduced keeping the alloys much cleaner
"Approaching the first 1K miles and on the whole has been a great experience. The Q5 has more than lived up to expectations. There are however a few things that do annoy me with top 3 beingPosition of the pretty large wing mirrors results in quite a big blindspot around the drivers side a-pillar area. I'm having to adjust regularly to be able to see over or around the wing mirrorI usually stream music over bluetooth from my mobile, when doing so there is no way to skip tracks using the steering wheel controls so have to take my hands off the wheel and fumble around for the knob on the MMI consoleThe buttons on the keyfob are too raised which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't so easy to press. They can be pushed down with the slightest of pressure which has resulted in me unlocking or locking the doors when the key when I didn't want to.How about you guys/girls."
"Not had theses issues with point 1 and 3 and haven't tried point 3, I do think the head light range is poor,and the sat NAV is very slow ,other than those 2 things no real isues ,oh and sunroof creaking and rattling ,very annoying ,it's been fixed once but started again intermittently this week ????"
"Drive select you can do an individual settingComfort signals can be turned off in the system#1 performance of the SQ5 is not what's claimed by Audi, its impossible to get close to it#2 some of the material finishes could be better#3 lots of number 3s, lack of standard equipment"
"@SteveMak - I would have much preferred a touchscreen icon based system as opposed to these fiddly knobs but it seems the Germans don't like it, BMW & Benz same. Maybe because they're a bit ocd having grubby fingerprints all over the screen.@Snow Man - totally agree with your #3, a lot of the stuff Audi makes you pay for on an already pricey car is just stingy"
"#1 All lights should be LED as standard (interior and exterior).#2 The brushed aluminium trim looks good, but is too easy to damage (soft).#3 The position of the headlight switch - I hit my knee in the demo SQ5 and got a nasty bruise, I have also knocked it in mine without knowing and been driving around wih only DRL's and wondering why my dials are so dim."
"Not without the Navigation package you can't. They're two completely different MMIs. The non-Nav MMI is very much a subset of functionality, with a much older look and feel."
I have to agree with Snow Mans #3 too. I'm also worried it's gonna get nicked. It should have been a touch screen. This knob thing is useless. My old Subaru was all touch screen and it's hard to adjust to the knob.
"Agree, the touch screen devices are pants.. They are a nightmare to use on the move, get covered in dirty marks and don't look as good.I personally wouldn't buy a car with a touch screen, but either way its not coming to Audis anytime soon thankfully."
If it makes anyone feel better we're on holiday with a Shit-roen C4 Cactus ???? hire car and it is truly abismal to the point of being funny! Too much to criticise but of relevance they have put everything on a touch screen inc temp controls and it's just plain awful. All on one touch screen not a good thing.
"Top 3 forme:-1 - Cabin rattles, im fed up of having them looked at. No actual fixes just a squirt of silicone spray seems to be Audi's retort. Mines just gone out of warranty so I guess Audi will stick the 2 fingers up.2 - The seats, the frames seem to be made of cheese and creak (Had this on my two A6's also). Cheap leather interior and quite uncomfortable, compared to Mercs.3 - MMI (3G High HDD), No filename scrolling for songs, no album art work, clunky out of date interface."
MMI displays album artwork if you have satnav?
"The leather quality (at least napa) is much better than merc, you're talking about different types of materials."
Yep Nappa (real) leather is much nicer than the artificial leather that Merc calls Artico crap that came on my business partner's C-Class
"Black pack is number 4, but at least its a red flag to avoid them!"
"Our car will be two years old in September. Overall, very satisfied with the car. Only irritating issue that occurs occasionally is stalling the car at traffic lights when the stop/start kicks in just as the lights change."
"1) Stop/start system.2) being unable to disable Stop/start system3) Parking sensors cutting out the radio too much, too often for too long"
You can press the button to disable the stop start - takes the same effort as releasing the handbrake.parking sensors mute also can also be switched off in the MMI.
I believe activating HHA also disables stop / start and you can also adjust the volume on the sensors?
"When you come to a halt and the stop bit of stop/start happens, if you release the footbrake then engine will restart but HHA will hold the car stationary. If you select Park when stop/start is in action(?) then the engine will remain stopped if you release pressure on the footbrake and will restart when D is re-engaged and footbrake is re-released. That is, of course, unless the engine conditions do not allow this to happen."
"Approaching the first 1K miles and on the whole has been a great experience. The Q5 has more than lived up to expectations. There are however a few things that do annoy me with top 3 beingPosition of the pretty large wing mirrors results in quite a big blindspot around the drivers side a-pillar area. I'm having to adjust regularly to be able to see over or around the wing mirrorI usually stream music over bluetooth from my mobile, when doing so there is no way to skip tracks using the steering wheel controls so have to take my hands off the wheel and fumble around for the knob on the MMI consoleThe buttons on the keyfob are too raised which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't so easy to press. They can be pushed down with the slightest of pressure which has resulted in me unlocking or locking the doors when the key when I didn't want to.How about you guys/girls."
"When I set the side-mirror selector (rotary dial on the door) to the passenger's mirror, and the shifter is in reverse, then the mirror dips so I can see the curb. Even though I can't see the wheels or tire directly, if I assume that the wheels line up with the car's side body panel, and use that to gauge my distance from the curb, I'm within a few inches of target. I've found this to be really useful for parallel parking. When you shift out of reverse, and/or if you deselect the passenger-side mirror using the rotary dial, the mirror returns to its normal position."
"Well I have Satnav and its the MMI high version with the centre joystick, it certainly does'nt display any kind of artwork.""The leather quality (at least napa) is much better than merc, you're talking about different types of materials. ""Im talking about standard spec leather on equivalent priced vehicles i.e. E class and not C's."
Whistling heater/air con is my one major gripe. Need to open the air vents to make it quiet but that's often too draughty.
"No dogging site POIs on the satnav,"
"Check in the passanger foot well, the pollen filter is there. Mine was not fitted correctly after being changed at a main dealer and the whistling where the cover holds the filter in place was paaing air, it drove me mad too."
Radio is always on the same low volume when I turn ignition on... too quiet to understand anything but lound enough to annoy me... am I getting old?! lol
"Lol colharris, is that a GSP I see ? lovely dog, miss mine greatly.1. Mentioned before but, that headlight switch that I knock with my knee every time I enter.2.Oil level indicator that they obviously don't want you to check easily. Dipstick too prosaic for Vorsprung ?3. Left side turn indicator lever. (I am a slow learner)."
"Hi Keithian. No she's a Labradoodle who looks like a slightly curly flatcoat retrieverI have thought of something. I would like to have the digital speedo, the range and the current MPG all on screen at the same time. I would also like radio text to scroll across the top of the DIS instead of just station name, but that's being really picky."
"My3 are:1. Start/Stop Malfunctioning with only 2000kms2 .No heated steering wheel available3. Lack of more info; Oil temp, Oil pressure, Tranny Temp, Tire pressures, Lots of vehicles have touch sreens now"
I find the radio reception (FM) isn't as good as on my old A4. Stations tend to get very weak in places where I never had any problem getting a decent strong signal. Often the station list loses most of the stations or doesn't show the station ID. I don't know if this is just my car (maybe a poor connection somewhere in the aerial wiring or a poor earth connection) or is a general Q5 problem (late 2010 car).
Stop / start functionWater in side mirrorsAudi Connect - WTF is it / how does it work? Have tried dozens of times to grasp the nettle but still can't.If I'm allowed a 4th - squeaky brakes...
+1 ????
Only one annoyance for me: the bloody light switch position! I keep on banging my knee on it!
Yes it seems to b happening more frequently now ????
1) My wife likes it so much she always finds an excuse to use the SQ rather than her car2) The stop/start is a little annoying but really hitting the off switch isn't a big deal for me3) I'm finding it hard to justify changing to a Macan Turbo as it does everyhting so damn well..

Oh and the SQ does seem 2 munch tyres ????
"One thing I positivelyloveabout my Q5 3.0 TDI is the very respectable fuel economy. My best tank is 5.77 L/100 km (real, not indicated). That works out to 40.77 MPG US, or 48.97 MPG Imperial. And it also has very respectable power if I put the pedal to the metal, with 0-60 mph times of around 6.4 sec. That's in the league of many sporty cars! Yeah, the mighty SQ5 beats that, but at the ongoing cost of fuel economy. My Q5 3.0 TDI is plenty quick for me, and sufficiently miserly on fuel, even though it's not The Ultimate Q5."
"On the pano roof issue, I greased all the connecting hard rubbers around the frame, don't forget the centre one. Sorted it a treat......it was that bad I thought it was a rear seatbelt buckle hitting the plastic trim."
"Can I turn off the nav arrow guide in the center trip computer display while my nav is running in the MMI infotainment display on the side? I want to see the digital mph even though I am using Nav.Oh, another thing, the MMI controller turns counter intuitive."
"Hit the button on the bottom side of the wiper stalk. It will cycle through the things you can play in there to get back to mph in big #s (which I usually can't live without). The rocker switch on the end of the wiper stalk will cycle through the secondary info below the main display (e.g, where digital mph is) -- range, mileage, time, etc."
With the front wipers on. The rear wiper coming on when I put the car in reverse. I know this dosnt happen if I remember to turn the fronts off first......remember being the key word in the last sentence.Steve
"rifleman said:my dislikes:#1. Rear LED's are off [unless you hack it with VAGcom] in daylight - i want them on ALL of the time.#2. Pano-roof often creaks when closed so i often drive with it ajar (took me a year to realise if you pull (don't twist) the knob backwards it opens the roof slightly at a slant like a conventional sunroof).#3. Information displayed by the DAB is terrible / absent compared to many other cars i have driven.#4. The tiny 'cargo-net' in the passenger footwell descintegrated when one of my boys rested his foot on the torch it was holding at the time and i have no idea how to fix it.#5. The flat part on top of the rear bumper is just asking to be scratched and every Q5 i have seen has etches in the paintwork there.#6. The heated seats (front and rear) heat up fairly fast - yet slower than any other car i have driven.#7. The independant temperature controls can be 'pushed' - but i don't know why? i thought that you would turn them for temperature, and push and turn them for fan speed but instead - i have to first press the 'fan' button and then turn them individually to the desired speed - surely a 'push and turn' would be a more direct and sensible approach to conrolling the fan speed?#8. The heated mirrors do not heat with the rear windscreen unless i have the selector set to the 'heat mirrors' setting - catches me out sometimes and i don't mind heating my mirrors if i'm demisting the rear windcreeen wether they need heating or not.#9. When i unlock the car - the folding door mirrors do not unfold and therefore the puddle lights fail to illuminate the ground as i step into the car meaning if there is a puddle and it's dark - i certainly won't see the puddle until i: a) stand in it, orget into the Q5, start my engine, wait for the door mirrors to unfold, then get out, step into the puddle again and close the door so it illuminates the puddle i have stepped into twice already - can you tell this really bugs me? again - other much cheaper cars can light up the ground before i get in - why can't my Q5!?other than that i LOVE my Q5Click to expand...I've found the same on #9 - I didn't even know that I had puddle lights until my son accidentally turned off the auto folding mirrors while he was messing around in the front! I wouldn't actually spec folding mirrors again on a Q5 - they are so deep that the folded vs. unfolded width isn't that great - and I don't park my cars in a narrow garage. There was a much bigger difference on my previous S5 Cabriolet.Re #3 - it is possible to find more info on the DAB like track info and commentary - but it's hidden in another menu so I've rarely bothered - as you say most systems have an auto scroll of the available data."
"agreed, although seeing them folded does give me peace of mind knowing i actually locked the car when i see them tucked in - i just wish they would unfold when i unlock the car rather than start it.does anyone know if this can be hacked with a VAGcom to deploy the mirrors (and activate the puddle lights) when the car is unlocked?"
"I found the Q5's ""folding wing mirrors"" implementation to be wanting. They don't actually fold. They rotate upwards, reducing the car's width only slightly (the main reason for folding mirrors is to protect them from careless passers by), and the upward tilt means they become a platform for falling accumulating dirt, rain water, snow, and other debris. I don't use this feature anymore."
"So how do I turn off the folding wing mirrors?Also, thanks ""big residual"" for the tip the wiper stock - I changed it today when I was using nav."
"After 2 years of ownership the absolute worst thing is my F@#€*n creaky pan roof that drives me nuts,going in again for 23rd time ,they take the whole roof out aparntly,God knows wat that will cost wen out of warranty ????????"
You can turn the folding mirrors off via the MMI - can't remember the exact setting but I've done just that so that my puddle lamps work. Completely agree on the folding function not being that effective. It made a huge difference on my old S5 Cab but next to none on the Q5. Handy to tell if you've remembered to lock the car though!
"admittedly it is hit and miss with the pano roof and it really does seem to depend on temp and humidity as mentioned on here previously - like you SQ Beast - i hear every little creak and rattle yet when i say to my family members who are in the car ""did you hear that?!"" - they are like ""hear what?"" lol.i've downloaded the instruction on how to grease up the roof so might ddo it this weekend and let you know how i get on, but it sure is annoying!oh yeah i meant to say - at the 2yr point - this would be a great time to get a new Q5!"

"rePanoramic Roof-- I custom ordered my Q5 with the highest trim level I could get (""Progressiv"" in Canada, middle of 3)withoutthe panoramic roof. I've had a car with a sunroof. I've had a convertible. I rarely used these features after the initial thrill wore off. I viewed the Q5's Panoramic Roof as a CAD$2000, 200 lbs. option that'll only tone down the blistering summer sun (and not totally obscure it), and be a potential source of irritation and maintenance issues over the life of the car.Yeah, I'm an oddity :-/ But I don't regret my decision."

When did your squeak happen? When driving along or when opening and closing??
"SteveMak - you have extremes of weather in most of Canada so maybe in the summer it will be too hot and in the winter too cold and in the weather doesn't bite you the mosquitos will!but over here in England i think the opening Pano Roof is one of the best features of the car and i drive with mine down all of the time when driving anywhere under 50Mph when it's not raining - i literally always have it open and even in the coldest months i have it open - i love it and wouldn't ever consider a Q5 without one, in Western Europe anyhow."
"My creak sounds passenger side,but passengers say my side,they only hear it wen I point it out,it stops if I put roof on tilt mode,but that's not a real solution,or if it's open its quiet,dealer said it's very common,it's annoying an inconvenient to have to sort 3rd time round,they want car for 2 days ????"
took me 20 months to realise there was actually a 'tilt' mode on the pano roof!#RTFM
"I only found out because of the forum,it's a RTFM moment lol ????"
"discovered mine totally by accident - and when it happened i looked up and said ""oh feck"" as i thought it got stuck somehow because of me twisting the controller the wrong way!"
"Cant find 3 things that annoy me about my q5.Only 1 thing that pisses me off is that it doesnt come with a spare wheel. And i need to adjust the whole boot to accomodate a full size 19"" spare!!"
"Had my Q5 for 2 days.Wish I went for the thicker steering wheel.Still a little unsure if it is big enough, side view looks fine, but front view looks really small.Possibly the extended black pack."
Same here - standard steering wheel is very puny compared to other cars I've had - my own fault for not upgrading
"Flat bottom wheel is a must for me... Sounds pathetic that such an item could be so important, but it is a lot better than standard."
"I was sceptical before ordering the flat bottom steering wheel. Thought it was all style over function. But really like it and glad I went for it. Nice grip / size, extra leg room, looks great and I'm used to the feel of it now."
"The flat-bottom steering wheel came as a part of my S-Line package. I love it. BTW, the flat bottom is helpful for entering and exiting the vehicle without having to tilt the wheel out of the way of hit it with your legs, assuming you're in the habit of leaving the car with the steering wheel oriented correctly."
i test drove a new X3 last night - i could not believe a flat-bottom sterring wheel is NOT an option on it.so off to the bottom of my Q5 replacement list it went...
I wonder how much it would cost me to retro fit it with Audi
To fkin much
"i think so mate, at least £400 i reckon?"
ReallyOh wellI am used to the thin gripLol
"Having had a quick look (difficult to see as a bit dark), but its not got an MMI system as there is no dial in front of the gear stick. So maybe just has an ordinary radio? Driver seat is well worn!"
Should add that I'm in Northern Ireland which may help. It's a short air trip from England/Scotland/Wales if s buyer wants to view but in the home market here there are only two SQ5s for sale and neither have sat nav which has to be a killer to most buyers. Local Audi dealers don't have any and seem to sell any they have very quickly.
"I sold mine back in July for 37k and it was May 2014 with 22k on the clock so had recently been serviced and had new tyres at 21k too. Didn't have B&O or heated seats though but had nav, privacy glass, remote tailgate, 21's and a couple other bits.I would have thought possibly 40k for yours."
Thanks Nick. Did you sell privately or to a dealer?
"Through a prestige dealer, but it was advertised on autotrader and they contacted me through my ad."
"Mixed emotions but having owned three Q5's on the trot, think it's coming up time for a change.Would have probably bought another SQ5 but with the new model probably not due until 2017 at the earliest, I've managed to secure an F-Pace First Edition for delivery around May 2016.http://newsroom.jaguarlandrover.com/en-gb/jaguar/news/2015/09/jag_fpace_first_edition_press_release_150915_uk/A bit more money agreed, but the technology and options lists looks impressive and performance / fuel economy seem on par with the SQ.Demand is already very strong but bang for buck, it just seems better value than the other option considered - a Macan S.Deposit is fully refundable if I don't like the static display models going into showrooms in December (i.e. no test-drives available pre-launch) so can only wait and hope I've made the right decision."
"Kudos for taking the leap (albeit with a fully refundable deposit). I'll be interested to see how they go - but at £65k I'd probably be aiming more RR Sport than Jag. I know you say there's good demand but my main concern would be residuals if they don't take off like they hope (see 2nd hand F-Type wagons for example).Having driven a Macan S, that will almost certainly be my next buy (petrol not diesel). It does stack up expensive though after you add extras to the terrible spec it comes with.Good luck with it - and feed back on how it goes!"
"I wish you luck there - from personal experience I've found that JLR are very good at skin-deep beauty/compelling marketing but somehow don't have the engineering pedigree to produce the quality of vehicle that we take for granted in Audi. If one takes a look at JLR's career web site then the kind of remuneration they offer for their senior staff would really make anyone half-decent think twice about joining so maybe the actual vehicle quality isn't such a surprise after all.That said I completely see your quandary, I'd like a change too and there isn't anything in the Audi range that really appeals (wish they made the S1 with Stronic) so I can see me waiting until the Q1 is announced."
"If I've had that many audis I c y u mite want to change ,any brand can become boring after a while,my current choice 4 replacing the SQ would b the MERC GLE coupe,but the price of &70k ish loaded to my spec is to heavy,I may have to consider a 2nd hand 1 in a years time wen SQ is 3 year old ????"
"Good choice Rob and not too long to wait. if all goes to plan let me know when you get it, would be good to take a look if you don't mind?"
"As the title says, is there any way I can just switch off the MMI display without shutting the whole system down?I can't seem to find the setting anywhere"
press and hold the volume button
Tried this but I it doesn't switch off the display. It shuts down the system.
What do members on here use normal diesel or ultimate for the 3.0tdi engine.What are your opinions on the ultimate fuel keeping the egr valve in a cleaner condition and saving trouble with choking up in the future.
I just use the local BP or Tesco standard diesel. Although I've often wondered if Ultimate diesel etc would be of any benefit.
Been wondering what type of diesel to put in the SQ5. So Tesco normal stuff is fine?
"Good to know SQ5John. I haven't checked the manual yet and I'm sure there was some bio diesel warning on the filler cap/flap, hence the question/wondering."
"Tesco get their fuel from the same terminals as BP, Shell etc, so most of the forecourt stuff is just marketing fluff.."
Super Market...
"Having been married to an executive in the petrol-chemical industry for over 20 years I can assure you nearly all forecourts have exactly the same stuff for sale, any difference possibly being additives, but they generally fill the lorry from the same tanks. Although, having said that, the higher octane stuff really is of a higher standard. Now I have used normal diesel (cheapest locally) in my X5 and then Q5 and never had any problems, but when I had my Alfa 156 about 15 years ago I did try Shell V-Power petrol and I found that the engine was smoother and faster and I got better MPG so it was just about worth it."
"Usualy esso is cheapest in my area,even cheaper than our tescos,I tried the super diesel,I did get more miles out of my tank,but no where near enough to warrant the extra 10p a litre,and performance wise didn't notice any difference ????"
"I exclusively buy fuel for both our cars from top tier suppliers such as Chevron, Exxon, Shell, etc. It is too bad that Costco does not sell diesel.My objective is to avoid issues such as carbon build up.In the case of engines with direct injection like Audi, BMW, etc, this is critical."
You may have been deceived by the market BS? Refineries don't produce poor quality fuels...
They do in the UK at their one fuel site in Liverpool. Hopefully they will install pumps at more UK locations soon.
"Very interesting as my wife refuses to use tescos fuel for our diesel Q5 as a few years back there was a problem with supermarket fuel, though i use it all the time in my old Landy Defender with no issues"
"I have over 6200 miles over 5 months on my 3.0 TDI using ULSD (Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel). No issues, no DPF regeneration light. I get respectable fuel economy with my best tank being 6.5 L/100 km (36.2 US MPG, 43.47 UK MPG)."
"Hi, Does anyone know whether using higher grade Dieseleg.ShellV-Diesel would help combat Diesel Particular Filter Regeneration problems in the long run?"
I had a Tiguan from new and did 6000 miles in 2 years. I had oil changed every 6 months and used Bp ultimate and Shell V Diesel. I have owned a Q5 for 6 months and done 2000 miles and just had an oil change also using those fuels. I have never had either car do a noticable Regen. I do short runs and occasional motorway blast. I believe the fuel and engine oil changes make a difference.
"I'm in Canada, where we use ULSD (Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel). After 6200 miles in 5 months, I have yet to see a DPF Regeneration light come on. I have the 3.0 TDI."
That's interesting I have a new SQ5 and soon after taking delivery went over to France on holiday and only used their Super Diesel. I did get my first noticeable Reg after a long spell at motorway speeds on a motorway when I pulled into a service area for a break. Perhaps occasionally reg has to occur whatever style of driving you do?
"Aside from my local dealer, does anyone know where I can get a replacement rear tow bar cover for my S-line Q5? seems my old one fell off at some point last month.Have tried the online breakers yard people but none have gotten back to me yet.Phil"
"Answering my own Q here, but I found these guyshttp://www.stokeaudi-parts.co.uk/to be very helpful and a decent price should anyone else need Q5 partsPhil"
"Due to having windscreen damage for the second time within a year I am thinking about settling costs for a replacement screen myself rather than claiming on my insurance, as this would likely mark me as a bit of a risk (although it's just pure bad luck!).Autoglass quote me £635 but this is not for Audi OEM, which is what I want (my current Q5 is under 12 months old). I'm awaiting their price on the OEM screen.Can anyone recommend another windscreen replacement company (with a midlands based depot) that I can compare with? Any other advice welcome..."
I do recommend OEM as if you dont any water ingress may not be covered by warranty as they will try and blame the screen. Happened to me with a CRV.
"autoglass prices are way over the top, we are independent windscreen replacement co with depot in stoke on trent, standard q5 sline screen would be acoustic with rain sensor + de fogging sensor + top tintwhich we could fit Pilkington glass covered by our warranty for £220 + vat , the cheapest way for oe would be to buy from audi and get us to fit for £ 80.00 + vat optional lane guidance would be slightly moreexpensive."
what's the de-fogging sensor?
"lol - yeah - i don't think we have much de-fogging going on in the Q5 other than hitting the 'windscreen button' which turns on the air-con and blasts the de-humidified air onto the screen.given that alot of the appeal of the Q5 is driving it in the cold / winter - i feel a 'quick-clear' mesh system would be better as the windscreen on my Q5 takes forever to de-fog and de-ice compared to my neighbours Ford Kuga which de-ices seemingly instantly!c'mon Audi, look at the competition and start providing us with what is available to others at least..."
All new fords use heated windscreen which is a patented glass exclusive to only ford. I have it on my focus RS. Had a windscreen replacement via auto glass took them 5 days to source the glass. It's v expensive as if I didn't go via my insurance the windscreen would have costed me over 800 quid
"all audis from about 2012 have fogging sensors if you have rain sensor look under mirror housing you will see vent if aircon on it will demist windscreen quicker. you won't know you have ituntil you turn up with wrong screen , because mirror bracket is different, ford quickclear windscreens are great when working but can be unreliable have fitted many transit custom screens for ford warrantyto find replacement not working properly either , anyway kuga build quality nothing like as good as q5"
sounds like a Ford Transit when starting from cold too!
Crowman - PM sent
surely a prestige brand like Audi can create something similar - it's obviously a good bit of kit and seems daft that Fords and other mainstream vehicles are now coming out with some far better and more practical parts as standard while we pay through the nose for more quality but less functionality.
I had a Morgan with a heated screen. The engine was Ford as was gearbox and axle. The screen was brilliant at clearing but once you perceive the heating elements you always notice them and they were distracting.
"hi folks,if any of you are financially savvy, can any i grab some advice from you please.my current Q5 is on PCP with a guaranteed final value of £18,800. however, the new Q5 i am about to order has a guaranteed future value of £21,800.is this better or worse for me next time around? does this mean the £3K higher value eats into my equity or what?if anyone can explain in layman's terms that would be great thanks."
"well, i asked my dealer to try explain and he said i am neither better or worse off - as it just means the values of the Q5 i will be buying into are predicted to be higher than the one i bought into 2 years ago (is this a good sign for Q5 residuals?).so i'm still none the wiser but the figures (i.e. deposit and monthly payments) are all looking good and make sense, i guess i am just trying to make sure i am not in for a nasty shock when the next time to upgrade comes around."
"Are the two cars different models? Kinda assume they have to be or the term is different as the values certainly aren't going to be increasing.If they are different models then its very hard to say if you are better or worse off. If they are the same model then you are worse off technically, this depends on you selling the car and thus in the second instance you have lower left over therefore less equity. If you return the car, which no one really does unless the values have tumbled below the GFV, then it doesn't make any odds.Tell us more and we can hopefully make sense of it."
"thanks lads,in addition to the spec of my current car listed below in my sig-block - i have added the follwoing to the Q5 i am just about to order:a ) Extended Black Styling Packb ) Technology Pack Advancedc ) Parking System Advanced (with Camera)so i guess yes it is a better spec vehicle, not £3K worth but perhaps it makes it more desireable?"
"I was told by a friend in car sales that zee Germans will often give you a higher GFV to reduce monthly payments so it looks good on paper budget wise but then you are locked into the PCP for longer, ie it takes longer to hit the 50% termination mark. Typically on a 4 year deal it takes 3 years to hit 50% with BMW or VAGPhil"
"Exactly Banners24B - my dealer tried this on me - up the balloon payment to reduce the monthly charge in order to match a competitor dealership (although for me that was all within a 3 year contract).A lot of people have no intention (or means) to pay off the balance at the end, so they are only focusing on the monthly cost. IMO those people should really looking at leasing their car with no right to buy at the end as they'll pay less that way. Don't think main Audi dealers offer that though so they end up on PCP."
"rifleman said:thanks again,i'll still be on a 36 month PCP of £345.2 yrs ago i paid £11K deposit on my current Q5 with a GFV / Balloon of £18,800.now the deal is just a £4800 deposit still on a new 36 month PCP of £345 with a GVF / Balloon of £21,800.at least i think the GFV / Ballon refer to the exact same figure?so the new GFV / Balloon is gone up by £3K but my deposit is gone down by £6K.Click to expand...Assuming the ticket price of the car is roughly the same, you are giving half the deposit so something has to give - and in this case it's the balloon payment. However the real ""cost"" is the interest rate.This calculator is quite helpfulhttp://www.pcpcal.co.uk/"
No you haven't been stitched up if you can handle the monthly costs which are higher than they would have been with the lower miles. You will have a car that should be worth more at the end therefore more equity left after the finance is cleared. Only if you wanted to rely on the GFV have you done yourself harm. This could happen if residuals collapse and it's worth less than GFV so you just hand it back. In this case you have paid more monthly than you should have. Yes the instance where someone wants to rely on GFV is very rare but then the happenings of a major motor group being caught cheating and thus loosing brand image and possibly residual values is also rare but does happen!!!
"I guess i need to be careful and make sure the dealer hasn't just added the cost of any discounts he has offered to the GFV, as this will eat into my equity.currently - he is saying I have £5500 equity on my car at its 2yr point with a 3yr GFV of £18,800.I just hope a new Q5 with a 3yr GFV of £21800 still has about £5500 equity in its second year, or this will leave me tight on on upgrade to a new new Q5 in 2017.great advice guys thank you, keep it coming, I'm learning a lot."
@rifleman - you can check the rough value of your car on webuyanycar/parkers etc. You'll need to factor in the remaining payments on your 3 year plan but you can ask your dealer to explain exactly how he's arrived at that equity figure using the current market value of the vehicle - he should prepared to do that - if he isn't I'd take your business elsewhere!
I think its very optimistic to expect the same £5500 equity at the two year point in a couple of years given the new model will hurt values and that the GFV has risen so much.
"He is talking complete bs, I am at 11k and I haven't even touched the top up oil"
After contacting a local Audi Dealer (Inchcape) for a new SQ5 they have arranged a test drive for me.They did not have an SQ5 in stock so they have loaned one from Head office.Rather surprisingly the test drive is for 24 Hrs.Has anyone else had a 24 Hr test drive or is it normal ?I am picking it up on Wednesday.They also mentioned that orders placed would be lucky for delivery this year.I will let you know how I get on.
"I had one for 2 hours last weekend.Marvelous machine, but 2 hours was enough to realise I just don't need all that extra power and harder suspension (only slightly harder, but enough to put me off)I was happy to get back into my comfortable old 2.0l TDI, obviously I'm getting old.However, if they're offering you 24 hrs, jump at it, you can make a very informed decision after that period.When I change up again I'll go for either the 2.0l or 3.0l TDI S-line plus again,"
You must try the new 2.0l engine before you decide.
I had one for three days!
"I definitely will, i think it will do me.Just a few people on here seem to get as good economy from the 3.0l as the 2.0l, so its easy to think well why not have the extra power available if not losing anything (except 4 grand)"
I had one for 2 days
If they want your trade they will let you have it for as long as it takes. I just got one in September and it took 3 months.
OkYes the dealer seems to be trying to get my business as there could be others as it will be my company car.I will see what the dealer can offer as a freebee.Anyone out there had gifts included with their Q5's ?
Just ask for the 12% discount or extras to that value...
I will certainly try to get as much as possible !
"This is easy to write about on here, as you regularly do, and good advice in general, i.e. go for the best deal.I just don't think delerships are going to go for it.Unless perhaps you're a 6 year veteran and on to the 3rd or 4th car with them."
UPDATE:I am now waiting for the dealer to come back to me with a revised quote.Don't expect to receive the car this year though.
"Lead time is approx 24 weeks at the moment,What are you going for spec wise?"
"Mine came in seven weeks, and I managed an eight percent discount, which was about the same as carfile were offering at the time"
Having spoken to three Audi garages they are advising that q5s are thin in the ground at the moment
"Just take the quote from drive the deal, if they don't match it walk and get it from another UK dealer.Currently offering @13% point is if you want to get that discount it easy to get it."
"Sepang Blue, Tech Pack Advanced, B&O, Mobile Phone High with Audi Connect, Privacy Glass, Pan Roof, Rear Bench Plus, Towbar, Climate Cup, Heated Front Seats, Elec Folding Mirrors Heated (Dimming) etc, Load area Fixing kit, 20"" Standard Wheels (its about 9k in options)"
"Nice spec, have they offered a decent discount? I can't believe Audi are selling used vehicles for more than they quote for new vehicles. It's to tempt the impatient planing at us I guess!"
Try Carwow as well. You can get a chat going with dealers and maybe find something in stock or on shorter delivery.

"phone Sam at What Car [Target Price] direct on 01508 579832 - he has saved me about £10K over 2 cars.the bloke is a wizard, knows everything about Audi's and will treat you like he is your own PA and it doesn't cost a penny."
"if so, any discernible differences over the 177 model?It's around 5% more power, just wondering if it's at all noticeable?Any comments welcome"
I have one. Only test drove a 177ps version very briefly back in May. It doesn't feel that much quicker but then I only drove the 177ps in mainly urban traffic conditions.
"I'm picking up my new one on Tuesday, so will tell you then! (Just a tad excited now...)"
"No doubt the new owners will regale us with stories of how its 100% faster, 100% more efficient etc ????"
Well that's about what I'm hoping to hear ????
That sounds a bit mean duke!
"Aw that's OK then, you're forgiven. I promise not to crow......too much!"
"Well then, I promised not to crow, but it's really hard.... The new engine is definitely an improvement, quick to pick up and lower gear ratios seem much better. I've been zipping about all day, didn't have to wait for suitable tap to nip out, just pressed and went.Best of all, new car us soooo pretty, and only one that wasn't grey, white or black to go out yesterday in MK. I'm besotted!"
I like the sound of that - I am picking mine up after work on Friday.
This post is no use without photos <lol>
"Jadewoo,Thanks for that. sounds promising !!Are you happy with the Alcantara seats?"
How do I post photos??!!
Use photo bucket ????
"Yes Ransman, I love the door handles! I also like the chrome strip on the boot, it shows up nicely against the red too.Still not sure how to do photos, is there a link?"
"Oh and the speedo is non-linear, i.e a larger distance between 30 and 40 and decreasing gaps every 10mph"
"if so, any discernible differences over the 177 model?It's around 5% more power, just wondering if it's at all noticeable?Any comments welcome"
"So, it seems good reports, and in the right area.I find that the only time mine is sluggish is from a standing start, and it looks like the new one has been improved there.Thanks."
"Ransman. Happy you like your new ride, controls are nicely installed. Who owns the green Aston DB2 mk1 fixed head? I did now someone who raced one years ago? Lost touch. Dread to think what it might be worth now. Anything to do with you?"
"I am very pleased with the car. Apart from the improved throttle response the brakes also seem smoother in operation and the HHA doesn't ""grab"" like in the previous car. The seats also seem to have a bit more ""give"" in them but IMHO that is not a bad thing. It's too early to say what the fuel consumption is like but initial signs are positive compared to the 177PS.The Aston is nothing to do with me unfortunately. It was parked outside of my hotel room window back in June (Dower House, Woodhall Spa) and was drawing a lot of attention. If you google that registration you can see that this car has some history behind it."
"Hi All, A newbie to here and the Q5. Just taken delivery of the Sline Plus 190ps STronic and wondered what you guys think I should be getting as to MPG. Currently done around 250 miles on mixed journeys and it looked like it was around 32 - 35 mpg. Is this what you would expect?Just wondering as the dealer was quoting 48MPG combined but thought it may have been around 40ish?"
"Quick update, this mornings commute to work was 40.2 MPG, so seems to be getting much better.I'll let you know in a few weeks how it is fairing."
"Don't even consider the DIS figures, especially over individual journeys.Do it old school,Full tank to brim and set mileage to zeroRun till tank almost empty, re fill to brim.Note miles travelledNote fuel taken in litres and divide by 4.55 for gallons.Divide miles travelled by gallonsThat's the best way to be accurately disappointed"
"Crikey that is low I averaged just over 33 in my SQ5 over 22,000 miles, was mostly motorway cruising with the odd blast."
"Sj1000 said:Don't even consider the DIS figures, especially over individual journeys.Do it old school,Full tank to brim and set mileage to zeroRun till tank almost empty, re fill to brim.Note miles travelledNote fuel taken in litres and divide by 4.55 for gallons.Divide miles travelled by gallonsThat's the best way to be accurately disappointedClick to expand...Agreed - it's the only way to do it. The DIS on my last car was out (optimistic) by 6.5%."
"Must be one of three options:- It's broken, as you suggest, or- Very short journeys and/or- Very heavy right footIf I was getting that low mpg I would be seriously disappointed."
"First fill-up after 566 miles has given around 39mpg (calculated, not DIS), which I think is excellent compared to my previous car's 31.6mpg on a 280 mile motorway run on the first tank (sticking to the speed limits).I am back to work next week on a 5 mile commute each way so I expect to see that figure drop in everyday use until the engine is run-in a bit."
"Yes, 39mpg was exactly what I got on a run up to Scotland, and never equalled it since."
"Just to clarify - these figures were for the first fill-ups on two different new Q5's, one a 177ps and the other (better one) on the new 190ps engine. You would expect to get improvements from an engine that has been run-in."
"Best so far after 4 fill ups is 36mpg, calculated the old school way."
OMG! blipping up and down at 1mph intervals was one of my favourite features of my Q5's cruise control!how can i possible squeeze an extra 1 or 2 mph into an 'average speed' camera zone now or control my cruise speed with pinpoint precision if it only goes up and down in 2.5 or 5mph blips?!?!?! i am devestated!
"I collected my new Q5 2.0 TDI s-tronic on the weekend, its definitely drives faster and feels more lighter to drive but I am comparing it to my previous 2011 2.0TDI which was a manual."
If you select cruise when at 41 it will remain at that speed. Blipping the lever will either take you down to 40 or up to 45. Don't forget that I have Adaptive Cruise Control on this one so it's different from the standard cruise control.
i'm ordering Technology Pack Advanced (including Adaptive Cruise) on my next Q5 this week - i'll miss blipping it up and down for precision in 1mph increments.
"if so, any discernible differences over the 177 model?It's around 5% more power, just wondering if it's at all noticeable?Any comments welcome"
"You can set it at whatever speed you want by pressing the ""activate"" button at that speed."
You can still do that; just press the accelerator slightly then press the cruise button
"Been into my dealer today to speak about a car for someone at work and while I was there got a trade in value on my SQ5 (I have been looking at the S4/S5). It's 1 year old 23k on the clock, Phantom Black, 21"" wheels, Tech pack, memory seats auto folding mirrors, adaptive lights, remote tailgate, flat bottom steering wheel, ADS, phone prep low and privacy glass. They basically said 36k does that sound like a good deal? Has anyone managed to negotiate trade ins up any more?I am thinking 40k if I sold it privately?Cheers."
"For a race in it sounds reasonable,and yes I think 40k would b possible if you retailed it ????"
"Cheers mate, might have to give it a try and see if I get any interest."
any joy nick?
I cant see you getting close to 40k tbh.Trade price is around 32k for a car with that mileage.
yep sold it back in July for 37k to a prestige dealer. Hopefully picking up my next Audi next month.
"my car Q5 is 2yrs old with 27,000 on the clock and my dealer tells me i have £5500 equity on it - i don't know if that's good or not if that helps?"
If you have the 2.0 TDI snowman may be right! If the dealers offer is good and you have equity could be worth changing.Kind of glad I am going back to petrol although I bet it will be #petrolgate next!!
"lol no i'm still good as of today and he will hold that price for me for the month of October.but i think you're right - the bubble will burst soon and i think locking into a good deal on an EU6 engine now is worth doing, that's a big part of why i am changing now."
Yeah it's probably a good idea and if the numbers work go for it. Hope you get something sorted out.
"Had my SQ5 for around a month and occasionally when leaving the car smell a warm rubbery smell which seems to be coming from around the underneath somewhere in the middle. Originally thought it could be the tyres but pretty sure its not. Notice also that fan running to cool things down so may be related and can happen on short and long journeys. Have covered around 1,300 miles so maybe something is still bedding in? Any ideas anyone?"
"Quote from Honest John >""The reason for the fan running and the burning smell was that the diesel particulate filter was regenerating as it should do. Would have been better to have kept driving the car for another 5 - 10 minutes for the regeneration process to complete."
"It's a shame Audi couldn't install a dash message stating when the regenerating process was going to begin, giving you the option of driving on to complete the programme."
I suppose that's fine but in reality its sometimes difficult just to keep driving. Will it do any harm to let it complete with the ignition switched off?
"I do not believe re-gen cycle completes if you just switch the engine off during the cycle. However, that should not be an issue if you give it a decent run, say once per month.One is advised not to buy a diesel if your driving profile is short journeys only.If your profile is town driving only, I would suggest you consider the Italian tune up."
This is one of the less desirable features of a modern oil burner.
"you sound like my dealer Mr H! so i think actually you both make sense and you know actually a lot, thank you."
"Personally I would take the new one. 3K to change is peanuts, the new one could be nearly two years away with little prospect of any discounts for at least another year after that. Your new one will be 3 years old then and there are plenty of people who will wanting a Q5 of that age and spec who can't stretch to a new one.Plus you'll probably have some compensation due or paid by then to ease your way into a new model."
"I decided to change rather than wait and, so far, it has been a very good decision. The garage have my ""old"" Euro 5 and I have a new Euro 6.The new 190ps engine is a significant improvement on the 177ps in terms of responsiveness and signs are looking good on fuel consumption.I would say don't wait for the new one, especially if you could get the dealership to throw in one or two nice options for free. I am really impressed with Adaptive Cruise in the Tech Pack Advanced."
I also took the plunge and sold my old 2011 model and purchased a new Q5 and what a difference. No regrets and in 2.5-3 years will look to upgrade to the newer model which would be out for a year while they get rid of the bugs.
You need to ask yourself if you would really want to be one of the first people owning a car built in a new facility in Mexico?
"The dealer has sold my ""old"" one within two weeks of it going on sale so there must be some punters out there willing to buy Euro 5's before the fix."
"the good thing is - if i order a new one - i can still private sale and so long as i get more than £5500 (that is what my dealer tells me i have now - does this sound about right?) in equity then i am quids in.thanks for your advice guys, keep it coming."
"rifleman said:indeed it would be a hard thing to test - either it will stop your car - or you will crash!the Technical Pack Advanced am i right in saying doesn't have the 'lane keeping', but 'side assist' which will tell you if its safe to overtake or not?i'm going to try push my dealer to throw the Technical Pack Advanced pack in for free - and Parking System Advanced in order to entice me back based on them selling me a vehicle deliberately fitted with cheat software.i can't see me getting anywhere with that though!Click to expand...I think at least one of the brochures has it wrong. At first I was expecting lane assist but then I read somewhere else it was side assist. The car actually has lane assist, which is a shame as I would have preferred the other one. Still I only really wanted ACC, and buying Tech Pack Advanced gave it to you cheaper than buying it on its own. In fact, if you want both, it's half price getting Tech Pack Advanced compared with buying them individually."
Registered 4th September this year
lol - well this month Audi are touting the Technical Pack Advanced as 'Adaptive Cruise' and 'Side Assist' - who knows what November will bring?!
That's a great result. Nice low mileage helps a lot.
"Steppy, wasn't peter Nash by any chance. They recently gave me £2k more for my wife's tt than Audi we're offering to trade in for a new one."
"Yes, our tt was low mileage and was sold within a week. Great cars in their showroom. They even let us borrow their courtesy car for a few days whilst we waited for the new tt.Certainly recommend them.What are you replacing the q5 with.I have just finally ordered a q5, to replace by bmw 320d tourer."
Nissan Leaf?
"Hi, I've just traded in my S line plus, same age as Steppy's but with 26k on the clock, got £27.3k. I think that's about 70%, which was fine by me!"
"Yep same here got £27,000 on September 2015 trade in for my March/13 Q5 S-Line and ordered SQ5 with a 10.5% discount for September delivery. Overall sounds like a good deal??"
Did you manage to get 9% / 10% from your local dealer? Sounds like an amazing deal!
"No, dealer over 100 miles away but no big deal they can deliver or I can have a day out driving there on exchange day. If you are really interested in the best deal around try configuring a car on the Audi website and get a code then send this to all Audi dealers in say a 100 mile radius asking for their best £. It takes a little time but if you have this then why not try and see how you get on."
"Ordered an SQ5 this afternoon - through drivethedeal and got 11% off the list price. Very happy with that! Local dealer, Manchester Audi, wouldn't do a discount apart from the £500 Audi contribution to the PCP deal. Coming through a Scottish dealer but gets delivered to my door anyway! September or October delivery tbc"
My local dealer just 2 miles away from me wouldn't go any higher than 6% on a Sep 2015 S Line Plus. Went to another dealer only 12 miles away who did 10% on the same spec so that's where I ordered from. Funny thing is they're part of the same group.Another dealer not too far away I went to were taking the mickey. They offered me £1000 discount only on the provision that I buy gap insurance from them at £950. I had to hold the expletives back when the salesman called me.
"I got 10% off from Amersham audi plus £500 pcp contribution, on a sline plus 2 litre but they offered a poor exchange value on my current sline so looking to sell it privately."
Go for the 20TDi over the petrol offering.
"adamaid said:Hi All,I have test-driven a 2012 2.0 TFSI from my local dealer - I wasn't overwhelmed by the engine, but it was a short drive, and I'm coming from a fairly growly Golf, so that may skew my expectations.Anyone whose driven the 2.0 TFSI Q5 and has a view, I'd love to hear it! I am assuming that all of the Q5 range is actually in the scope of the emissions finding, which I guess may not be the case?Thanks!AdamClick to expand...I have the 2015 TFSI 2,0 Q5 and I am impressed with the engines performance. I had to fit in city driving with long country journeys at 110k/hr and it seems to do both well. My comparison is a Toyota Aurion 6speed/6 cyl petrol engine that was a super country traveller. The Q5/Aurion compare very well, both give about 8 lt/100 k.and both travel at just under 2000 rpm at that speed."
"Perfect time to get the 20TDi, you'll get a good deal and they still have to fix it regardless...Use the situation to your advantage.TFSI has the carbon buildup issue which is not getting corrected."
"Although VAG will certainly correct the emissions problem with 2.0 liter diesel engines, we don't know how it'll affect the user's experience. Today, we can consultFuelly.comto determine what kind of fuel economy any group of Q5s is getting, such as those with the 2.0 liter diesel engines. We also know from users how the engine feels and responds. Audi's fixmightaffect various characteristics, including a decrease in fuel economy, power, or even the non-diesel sound (my 3.0 TDI sounds like a petrol engine instead of diesel, and I like that). With those unknowns, I'd be wary before jumping in, but that's just me."
http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2015/01/is-carbon-buildup-a-problem-with-direct-injection-engines-.htmlIts a much bigger problem the #dieselgate.It basically due to the way the DI works.
"I am not an expert but have been delighted by the 225 TFSI which I have been running for the last two years - the engine takes a bit of warming up, but is effortless at high speeds and always has plenty of power to overtake when needed, and it enjoys being pushed hard - and it's delightfully quiet. Fuel economy is OK but I don't do a massive mileage at about 10,000 miles a year."
"Hi all, Picked up my new SQ5 in September and notice that the Oil Service schedule is set for around 360 days or 8500 miles but the Service is set for 18,500 miles or around 2 years. Any idea why the oil needs to be changed each year as with my Q5 they were both around the same time eg. 2 years under Variable scheduling. Probably need to change the blood in the 3.0 Bi more frequently??"
First service on my SQ5 was at 2 years. Seems yours was not set up for long life oil service?
Can this be retrospectively changed to a Long Life schedule to match Service? if so can I take it to any dealer as the dealer I used to purchase is miles away?
Is this something a mere mortal can do or does it have to be done by Audi?
"It seems you can do it yourself from within the MMI - it is not re-setting the interval length; just the ""start date"" .................."

"So my insurance renewal is due September ,bin on line getting some quotes and noticed they're saying the market value of my 63 reg SQ is £30k ,but you can't bye 1 for that ,and I assume if I get insured with them that's all they would pay out in a worse case sinero,has any one else ever checked there insurance market value of there car ? ????"
"It's not about its purchase price from a forecourt, thats not what it's ""worth"" - its only worth the trade price.Last time i looked a 13reg SQ5 was around 31k, so it wouldn't surprise me.Try putting your reg into webuyanycar, then taking off £500-1000 from that number.I'd take the trade price and add 10%, so 30k, would be 33k, etc... no point paying for extra or a higher value, it's only go to get paid out at the market value."
The actual value often makes little difference. I have seen me try figures to see and often 5k hasn't made any difference but as above it means little as they will value it if a claim occurs.
"Well I guess as long as u have GAP insurance as well the battle between what your insurance value it @ and them isn't your worry,you'll still nearly get all your £ back if a write off or stolen,even though the trader ice may be £30k ,I couldn't go a bye 1 for that with similar spec ????"
"Hi,Just to let you that some sites use tools / data bases that estimate the approximate value of the vehicle selected.

Guys - a thread on this topic has already been posted in 'Off-topic discussion'http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/24985-vw-emissions-scandal-hits-11m-vehicles/
I am surprised no one has yet talked about this on this forum.I believe that the engine in some Q5s - specifically the 2.0 diesel with the adblue system - are basically the same as the units found to be 'cheating' in the US. The Q5 would not have been mentioned in their list as the Audi USA does not sell the 2 litre diesel Q5 only the 3 litre version which does not seem to be affected at the moment.Has anyone contacted Audi to check if the Q5 with Adblue is affected?You have probably gathered that I have a 13MY that has Adblue so I am starting to get concerned particularly about resale values etc if it is affected.I will probably contact Audi myself but just thought I would check to see if any one has already done so.John

Apologies - not sure how I missed that!!Must be old ageJohn
If so why ?
Ditto... where's it gone???
The algorithm cleaned it out.
So this will soon disappear as well then .............. I think as owners of these cars we should be free to discuss this subject. From the posts that I read no one had said anything derogatory about VW.
Admins - where did it go?!
Its in the Off Topic Discussion section. Shouldn't have been in this section to start with as it doesn't affect the Q5
"Thanks, but i think you may be wrong about it not affecting the Q5."
It concerns the 3 litre v6 supplied to Audi and Porche

I was thinking of going for the new winter tyre from Pirelli (Pirelli Scorpion winter) as it is the only tyre I can find that would just be a straight swap for the Dunlops (255/40 R21)and be able to cope with the winter (I don't want a seperate set of wheels and winter tyres).Two questions that I would like to ask please.....1. Can these winter tyres safely stay on the car all year round?2. Are these the only tyres available that would be a straight swap for the 21"" wheels?Many thanks for your helpGerry"

"Thanks for your response Raphster, useful info.winter tyres all year round it is then, especially as I do about 6k per year!"
"Interesting to know that there's now a 21"" winter tyre available coz to the best of my knowledge, there wasn't one last winter.I'm running Dunlops on the 21"" summer wheels and 20"" Pirelli Scorpion Ice and Snow on a separate set of winter wheels.FWIW, Pirelli's work great in the colder months."
"I'd get all season M&S tyres if they are to be your only set.Personally, I use this type on my current CR-V and they are a fine compromise, including in the snow for the annual ski trip with 4wd.On my Boxster, I have two sets of wheels. Summers on 19s and Winters on 18s. I believe that narrower tyres, as well as the colder compounds are better in the winter. The Winters drive ok in the summer but do not have the same grip as Summers in the warmer weather (>7C) - I would be much more cautious in the twisties . Also, they supposedly wear a lot quicker"
"Hi all,So have picked up the SQ5 today, o what a car! Well worth the wait, I have owned few cars and have to say this is amazing in every way!I remember reading that some owners have Dunlop tyres on their car's but have noticed mine are Pirellis just wondering what is on everyone else's?I will put pic's up asap have been too busy driving it all day, pretty much any excuses to go some where!"
"Congrats mate, looking forward to seeing those pics!"
Picked up my sq5 today it has Dunlop max gt tyres
Mine came with Michelins...
Dunlops for my SQ% they handle quite well with limited noise in imho

Thats strange as we just picked up our 2014 model SQ5 and it is wrapped with Pirelli P ZERO'S
Had Dunlop max gt on my 2012 A5 cab and they where rubbish. Had to be replaced every 10-11k
"Apparently it's totally random. I read that it just depends what's in stock at the factory on the day. For the 21s at least the Dunlops seem a lot more popular, I'm guessing they favour them due to the obvious cost difference, but if they run out they use the P Zeros to keep the line moving."
Pirelli P Zero's on mine which I collected on Tuesday morning.
"Ours came with Michelins, would have rather had pirellis - but only because i don't like the french!"
"P Zero on mine 21"" - i am just waiting for the day i get an unrepairable puncture - i sense that there might be an issue sourcing one.quick check round the usual online lot draws a blank for any type (blackcircles, mytyres, etc etc)"
So i presume we have the p zeros as we have opted for the 21 inch wheel uograde and the standard wheels have Dunlop or Michelin fitted?

For the record I have Dunlops on my 21's
"Same here estoril , I've had no problems with them"
"My ""unrepairable puncture"" arrived overnight, as I found out this morning.Drove two miles to dealer, only to be told (without removing the wheel/tyre), a new one is required.Shipped overnight from Birmingham to York, £251 fitted (Pirelli)."
Gutted.Not an unreasonable price considering the size.
"Made sure I got a ""benchmark"" price from Asda Tyres first and Audi matched it!Considering some of the online prices I saw..."
"That's a gr8 price from main dealer,"
Oponeo currently have stock of 255/40 x 21 Pirelli @ £231 delivered if anybody needs them
"I wouldn't personly recomend useing pirelis again,they just wear far to quickly"
"Neither would I. I just didn't want to put an odd tyre on, when the others are Pirelli too..."
"Had same dilemma wen vredestein's stopped making 21"" ,and had unrepairable puncture,so had to bye 2 continentals for same axle,and kept other vredesteins for spare"
"All done.""No visible sign of puncture"".Inside of tyre shredded from a couple of miles driving with flat (I asked to have a look at the old tyre. They're big old beasts!).Happy that rears still have 6.5mm and existing front 5.5mm of tread, after 6500 miles (Pirellis).Maybe I'm not driving it hard enough......."

"You can run winter tyres all year round if you want to, best for it that I had were Vredestein Wintrac 4 Xtreme's now superseded with Wintrac Extreme S, low noise, great milesJon"
"Anyone tried the Contis sport contact5 yet my wife will probably need changing this later this year before the winter so was just looking for alternative to the Dunlop i would fit Michelin's but they don't do a 21"" in the size yetPirellis are out utterly shite across the range verds i believe have stopped making this size alsoi have been trawling the net and cant see any other manufacture making 21"" for the SQ5"
"Yes I'm running them ,paid £258 each I think,they seem to b wearing well on my rears ????"
What were you running before and do you feel they are better dry wet grip etc
"Would rather have a good tyre, than one that lasts longer. Will continue with the Pirelli's, as I can't fault them."
you must be one of the few as i have had pirellis on all my RS4s and the are the worst handling and wearing tyres i have had cant comment on the SQ5 but due to my past experience of them i always avoid them like the plague the wet grip is terrible and they were far too quickly i could live with 10k out of a tyre but best i have ever had on pirellis is 6kwhat sort of miles are you getting down under
"Hi all,So have picked up the SQ5 today, o what a car!

"My SQ came with pirelli,they were pony ,I got less than 6k out of them,the continentals are wearing far better and grip is great ????"
"Well i will opt for the contis when the time comes unless Michelin produce a 21"" tyre to fit before thatthanks for the info"
"I got 22k kms from the fronts, without any rotation, with the backs looking good for at least 40k. May consider Continental, but they are not available in Oz yet."
if you have the 21 inch P Zeros then you will also have only 5.5 mm of tread from new!
Eh!i thought new tyre came with 7-8mm new as a standard
If this is true it's no wonder the wear is poor ????
"i mentioned this to my local Audi dealer who confirmed it was due to the vehicle performance/weight combination and that tyres with 8 mm tread would potentially overheat at 155 MPH, therefore the tyre is designed by pirrelli for the SQ5.i know you cannot legally even sit at 50% of the potential top speed, but the potential especially in Germany is an option."
"So 20"" wheels with 8mm tread would over heat then? The circumference of the tyre be it a 21"" or 20"" is the same - bigger alloy/smaller tyre sidewall... That's rather misinformed info I feel..."
"My wife has managed to get just under 16000 miles out of the Pirelli's on our SQ, I've been quoted £168 + VAT for Pirelli's or Dunlops, can't get a quote on Michelin's though as apparently there aren't any around. Should I stick with the Pirelli's and am I having my ring pulled on Michelin supply (quite fancied Michelin's)?"
Where from?

Same combo as me if so. On the basis of that link I will avoid the Michelin's, but I am really surprised at the criticism. We will have to wait 4 weeks for the Dunlop's and will probably fit another set of Pirelli's but I'm not convinced by the ride quality, though general grip seems fine. My RS is on Bridgestone's and though they really grip in corners the car tramlines under load to a point where it feels edgy, similar to previous rear wheel 911's I've owned, which is a concern. Be interested to know what you're running, everyone seems to hate Pirelli's on the RS, but I'm wondering if the snaking is more to do with chassis than tyres."
"Yes same combo the SQ5 is on Dunlop's which are not a bad tyre but only on about 12K and almost done I'm surprise too about the Michelin review too to might go with the conti's as there is not too many manufacturers doing the 21""for the SQ5 and I wouldn't fit the pirelli tyres on a bikeAs for the RS4 can't see past the Michelin PSS great tyre had them on my last RS4 but they both came with Pirelli P zeros crap tyre made the car tramlined on the white lines on my frits RS4 the B5 it was positivity dangerous on the Pirelli's the tramlineing was so violentBut the PSS are the best tyre for the RS imo"
I still think it's a lot to do with driving styles..... However The pirellis are soft!!!Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"I thought in terms of tyre wearing/softness, from worse to best it was generally like this?Pirelli < Continental < DunlopHas Michelen just come out with a tyre that fits the SQ5 21"" alloys? If so where would they fit in the above?"
"I was told that Michelin do a 21"", but that delivery is 10 weeks!!! In the end I opted to stick with the Pirelli's, around £200 per corner (inc VAT) fitted. They're not my favourite but the tyres are borderline illegal and i didn't want to wait for Dunlops (4 weeks) or the Michelins."
Well my SQ5 got scratched by Audi tech changing the fuel fill flap it has since been repaired which I refused as the workman ship was so bad it had been sent back before that as the service manger spotted a run in the paintThought I would have it today as it been in another 2 weeks to be told service manger has sent it back AGAIN apparently they use a local body shop not a Audi approved body shopI have never had a problem like this before and not sure where I stand I have been offered a £200 Audi watch to say sorry any advice would be welcome I've only done 1500 miles in it .Thanks
Just tell the dealer you will not accept it until its perfect. Is it just the panel around the filler flap or the actual filler flap? Getting a courtesy car during all this?Tell them to forget the watch and you want some free services - after the above has been sorted.
They have changed the filler flap and the scratch was below the flap so they have had to blend into the rear wing
keep going until they correct it...
"Agreed with Snowman, if its not right keep rejecting.Out of interest what colour is the car?"
Thanks for the replys just very frustrating how the body shop can't get it rightThe color is ibis white
"I would maybe be telling them to repaint that whole panel its not very big, just long as it goes over the doors. Maybe suggest to them to use a different body shop, especially if it comes back again not perfect."
"like you have been advised, keep rejecting italso reject the silly watch and get free servicing or something similar, unless you actually want an audi watch"
"Went to pick up my car and I'm so relieved that it been repaired and I can't spot a thing wrong .I settled for dinner maximum of Â£150, pair of plates for my personal plate and a red Audi umbrella. Just hope this never happen again near on 4 weeks for a wonky filler flapí ¼í½»"
How wonky was it? Do you have a photo?Glad you got it sorted.
Looking at the flap the top right corner stuck out about 6mm the rest was flush looked worse when the car was a bit dirty as the edge got dirty as it was sticking outDidn't get a pic as I didn't think it was a big deal to fix ...... nearly 4 weeks later
"Always take a photo before these types of things. For example take photos of alloy wheels if getting tyres changed. Then if they scratch them you have proof. Take all over photo before a service. Then inspect before driving away. Always harder to come back later and complain.I generally do this after suffering a similar event to yours years ago with a previous car. Was having engine work done, car returned with scratches on front wing/fender. Obviously from leaning on it or resting something on it. With the usual it wasn't us explanation."
"Hi, I have had scuffed/damaged alloys on my SQ5 for a while now and am getting round to thinking of sorting them out. Does anyone have any idea how much I would likely have to pay per alloy?Also, anyone know any good refurbishers in the Colchester area?Many thanksGerry"

Makes the Audi alloy wheel insurance look like a steal at £149 for up to 18 claims!
Nice. The running boards are great and I also specced them factory fitted. I must warn you though that they collect the crap more than I would like and so a bit more cleaning is involved. Mind you - you'll be doing that anyway with black!
Do they help reduce crap being thrown up from the wheels like mud flaps would?Any other pros and cons you can think of?
"A little, but not a lot (why we still can't get mudflaps for S-line trim is a joke). If they are mucky you have to watch the bottom of your trousers, or a long coat, as you are stepping into the car.They are very useful for standing on to wipe down the roof after washing, but apart from that they are purely aesthetic. I much prefer my current Q5 with them, than the one I had previously without them!If they are factory fitted you find a new jack left in the boot, with amended instructions on how to jack up the car."
thanks very much
Do they stop mindless careless parkers putting chips in your doors?
Have specced B&O sound system in new car but curious as to what to expect. The standard system on S-Line 2.0 TDI has 10 speakers and 180w output but not sure what other bits and pieces it has dotted around the car. However it seems that 3.0 models may have additional equipment stored in spare wheel so assume the B&O system will have even more equipment -I know is has 14 speakers- but assume it will have sub-woofers and such like also in spare wheel. Appreciate some details from those in the 'know'.
What car?
SQ5.
"My SQ5 has the B & O system with the subwoofer in the spare wheel well. All I can say is that compared with other systems in previous Audi's the sound is fantastic. Don't forget to adjust the settings in the MMI for each of the functions, i.e. you can have different settings for radio, SD card, I-pod etc. Enjoy."
"As above.Some say it is not as loud as the standard Audi system, it is loud enough for my ears and a better quality sound."
"I think it's worth the £, it could b louder,but the sound is crisp ????"
All cars get the woofer in the wheel well not just the 3.0.Theres nothing in the system - both work just as well as each other.
I suggest you try to listen to both. I was lucky that my dealer had standard in a Q5 and B&O in a SQ5. I actually preferred the standard one for the type of music I listen to so I saved the money. They are both good though.
What sort of music is that colharris? We'll mostly have the radio on and when the children are in (most of the time) then it's quite quiet too. Not sure if it's worth adding it to my SQ5 order?
Have specced this for new SQ5. IMO if you are buying a top-of range car then its almost expected for this to have a good quality sound system. I hear that the standard is sufficient but it doesn't have Bang & Olufsen stamped all over it. Having said this I was able to get a healthy 10.5% discount on this option so works out to around £478. Just had to do it.
I was fortunate to be able to listen to both and would say the standard system is actually very good. The B&O is definitely more refined sounding but depending on the type of music played there's not really a lot in it. If you're going to mostly listen to radio then I would save the £560.
With the B&O you get the DSP - Digital Sound Processor which isn't part of the standard set up I think?The DSP enables you to choose the sound distribution profile Driver/Front/All - to my ancient and certainly less than perfect ears the driver orientated setting is fabulous.
"I've listened to both, and my friend has a standard Q5 sound system . As has been stated, the standard system is very good, the B&O however is much more rounded and handles all music genres extremely well. I wouldn't buy a £50k car and not put a £500 upgraded system in. That being said, other manufacturers have invested in better systems in their range topping models, and I think Audi should have offered something better."
"I have the B&O system and IMO, am disappointed with it.Wife drives a VW Golf Cabriolet with standard spec Radio / CD player and the sound seems crisper, clearer and louder with roof on or off for a lot less ££."
"Agree, you are paying simply for a badge - the door cards look better, but the sound is not really an improvement over the standard UK setup."
"All about opinions, and I do think more could have been done by Audi to make it stand out more, but the B&O sounds better by a distance to me. Was a no brainer box to check in my search."
"I know it's overpriced but I just love Bang & Olufsen stuff - ordered it for my new SQ5, and have it all over the house too. Still looks and sounds great after 15 years. You can probably buy cheaper and more technically advanced, but I'm still sticking with B&O!"
"Does anyone else have the issue of when you wash the Q5 and dry it off its all great, untill you drive then i seem to get water coming out of the wing mirrors causing water streaks / splashes down my doors.I can seem to get all water out i have tried seems odd but gets on my tits.....Does anyone else have this issue ?"
"True that. Same goes for the gap in the roof rails.This use to happen with my Land Rover D3 so what I did was stuff some tissue in the gaps between the housing & mirror then drive down the end of the road and back, I will probably do that next time I wash my Q5.On another note which Brodit phone mount do you use? Is it the one that attaches on the window pillar?"
no i have the one thats not listed on the broadit site any morehttp://www.ebay.co.u...=item4ae8024558Same as this its great to be fair i always buy the broadits
Sad I know but I always go for a few mile drive after washing and keep the leather in the car with me...I feel your pain!
"Why not just turn the mirror housing to face downwards and empty the water out that way, it works on mine WHICH is NOT the electric folding type. Saves you from going out just to empty the water out the mirrors, unless you particularly want to for some reason"
"I washed my new SQ5 for the first time last week and noticed this, I usually have them folded out for washing and then lock the car and fold them in before drying with a microfibre. I then take her for a blast to air dry anything remaining. This was a pain on my A5 too so expected it, the roof rails were a new pain with water creeping out long after drying, hence the quick drive to dry it out helps.Also amazed at the amount of brake dust on the alloys, I obviously used to use down gearing in my manual A5 a lot more than I thought for slowing down. I suppose the brakes are bigger too, nothing a bit of Sonax wheel cleaner doesn't sort right out."
"Yes I have the same issue after washing.I take the car to be washed about a minute away from home and then when I reach home I just touch up.Not a big deal really, but annoying never the less."
"Use a leaf blower to blast excess water out of mirrors after washing,job done ????"
Air compressor to blow the water out from all the gaps and there are many!Folding the mirrors down after washing and leaving that way for a few hours eliminates the mirror issue.
"Yep push mine the opposite way to the fold up position when I start drying. I also pop the black light covers off from the inside of the tailgate and clean up inside there as quite a bit of water accumulates, also stops the constant drips running out the bottom after the tailgate is closed.I then go for a quick hoon round the corner to clean off the water oxidisation off the brake disc's and get out any remaining drips. Wipe all off and good to go.MT"
Invest in a small leaf blower for mirrors as well as back glass below wiper also works great for the grille
or just drive the car...
or just don't wash it...
"Hairdryer, or move it back and forwards in the drive a couple times that get the majority out."
Take it for a spin around the block. Then wipe off the drips. Done.
"A spin round the block gets dust on the car, I wouldn't be drying mine after that! Too much chance of paint damage.Straight into the garage after a wash, compressor around all the crevices, mirrors etc then dry and leave mirrors folded down to drip out. Perfect!"
True I wouldn't recommend wiping/rubbing a car down with any chance of dust or grit. But you're drying literally a drip either side. When I say block I mean underground garage for me and it's pretty clean.
Haven't had a car that doesn't have this problem - a real pain

450bhp Q5 RS sounds awesome! So do the matrix headlights (LED or laser).
"Well, seeing is believeing. I wonder if a Q5 RS will emerge with the tougher emissions regulations. I also question Mexican QC compared to German QC."
Yes it will take the fight to Porsche. But Audi will have to get the price right or you wouldn't bother. Also lets hope Mexico has a lot of German team leaders and supervisors.

I have just seen the release of the SQ5 plus and sadly I can't change my car until March 2017!I'm guessing new model will be out by then? Anybody know if Audi are releasing the SQ5 upon new model release?
No one knows except Audi.
Didn't happen last time around. I doubt it personally but you never know.
The TT has been released in TT and TTSguise so though Audi may do the same?
"TTS and TT didnt release at the ""same time"" in EU."
My Audi dealership told me they will release the normal models first and the new SQ5 much later.
I'm going to bite the bullet and try and get one of the Macaw Blue SQ5 Plus models. Thing is I can't find the full spec of the plus model anywhere...I believe I can order tail end of the year and lead time is 6/8 months.
depends on the market - they wont come to every market and the specs will vary..

Hi guys. I'm hoping for some feedback from Q5 owners. I have bought a new 14 plate Q5. 2.0 TDI 177PS. The official date claimes combined MPG 47.1. I'm aware that there's no way those official figures could be met under our imperfect environments. So I wanted to know:What MPG do your cars deliver?I only ever do town driving do what could I be looking at?And finally on a full tank of diesel how many miles would I be able to cover.I look forward to your responses.
I am averaging 27.6 to the gallon and managed last time to put 18 gallons in the car which would give 500 miles.I realise motorway driving would extend this.My car does feel to be freeing up and the DIS is showing above 30 mpg now.
That's really low!! Is your Q5 new and are you in the process of bedding the engine inn?
"Hi,I have the same car, after 6 months and 6,000 miles, its 35.5 miles to the gallon.The tank holds 75 litres"
"After 7 months and 6,500 mile, 36.8mpg but that does include some motorway driving"
After how many miles did the engine break inn? How many total miles you getting on a full tank?
"I have heard people say it takes 10k miles or more to really break-in.Miles on a full tank depends very much on where you are driving. Mostly town driving I would expect to get around 500 miles on a tank, but I got 683 miles recently, with around 500 of those miles on a sedate road trip over three days.Don't forget that you will need to take the car for a blast occasionally otherwise the DPF will suffer."
About 34MPG A lot of short drives of about 3-4 miles from my village to nearest train station twice a day and then a 30 mile or so A-road trip and back every couple of weeks.
Cheaper road tax vs petrol version and also only a few hundred odd quid difference in price. Diesal engine made much more sence financially and economically.
Blimey! Our 2.0T petrol gives us 35mpg on a run and averages about 28mpg per tank. Thought you diesel drivers would be getting a lot more than that!
It's all good hearing these MPG figured but what are you guys actually getting tank to tank (mileage range) just curious to know. Audi dealer told me anything from 450 miles to 550 miles tops. It be good to know what you guys have been getting.
450 -470 miles but usually takes < 70 litres to brim and never got more than 71 litres in. Tank officially takes 75 litres so 500 should be achievable with a TFSI. Assuming a 2.0 TDI will do > 35mpg I would expect a safe range of 550 miles.
"On a trip from the Gold Coast to Sydney, which is about 520miles, I still had 1/4 of a tank left in my SQ5, equating to fuel consumption of 44mpg, and theoretical range of approx. just under 700miles.Best I have got is 46mpg from Canberra to Sydney (195miles)Current avg. over the 6k miles I have driven is 34mpg, compared to 28mpg for my previous A4 B8 2.0T Quattro."
We never really got above 32/33mpg on the 20TDi - SQ5 is giving better mileage.
Average around 35-40 mpg including 8 mile commute. Have had around 46mpg on a very steady but very boring motorway speed enforced drive. Near 500 miles on a tank full reasonably often.I have no complaints and it more than compares with friends similar size vehicles..
"Top gear Jeremy clarkson once said on top gear u get an extra 50 miles per tank if u only fill it half way,due to the difference in weight"
"Jeremy Clarkson talks some tosh, but that is the best one yet!"
Hi guys. I'm hoping for some feedback from Q5 owners. I have bought a new 14 plate Q5. 2.0 TDI 177PS. The official date claimes combined MPG 47.1. I'm aware that there's no way those official figures could be met under our imperfect environments. So I wanted to know:What MPG do your cars deliver?I only ever do town driving do what could I be looking at?And finally on a full tank of diesel how many miles would I be able to cover.I look forward to your responses.
Well said
"Well, it's not total nonsense, there is a saving to be made in theory. I once saw figures for a large family salon doing 12,000 miles a year. Basically, the 3 or 4 stone of fuel weight you save will be about 1% of the weight of the car and will save you about £20 a year. But... You will also top up over 20 times more, sometimes making an extra trip, and wasting some of that £20. So, true up to a point, but certainly not worth the damn hassle!Reminds me of my father-in-law who drives a 10 mile round trip to save 2 or 3p a litre. Life's too short."
"The theory is correct. We all know more weight = lower mpg. Clarkson grossly over exaggerated the saving. Like most of his glib comments they ought to come with a warning ""a little knowledge is dangerous""."
"41 mpg cruising to Wales, full to nearly empty tank at the legal limit + as much as I dare."
I was surprised. My usual mpg is 35 ish
Some really impressive MPG and millaege ranges. Im picking up my Q5 in a few weeks any advice for bedding the diesel inn or do I just drive as per normal?Also Ive been reading about the DPF problems encountered by some Q5 owners. Is it true that the adblue helps combat this problem ?(regenerating the DPF)
I have heard the AdBlue help the DPF burn off the particles at a lower temperature. Seems to work really well.Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
"I just stuck to what the manual suggested, i.e dont go much over 2,000 rpm (or was it 3,000..cant quite remember) for first 1500 miles.Very easy to do, 2000 revs in top gear is about 80mph"
"When I had my 140 BHP the first 8K saw 34-36 average, after 11K the average was 34,40-42, when I sold it at 17K most journeys were (brim to brim) Town:28-32, Motorway: 40-47@ 70-80mph"
"First post! and also first time Audi Owner.Received my 65 plate Q5, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to see the mpg/range on the current tank?The closest I've gotten is on the dashboard, the computer tells me the current (that moments) mpg, which isn't quite as useful.Anyone know how to get to that menu please?"
"Welcome to the world of Audi ownership. What did you move from?To answer your question; Just click the little button on the end of your right hand, wiper, column stalk to work through the options of range, current mpg, average speed etc; Clicking the button on the bottom of the stalk changes through the different display choices. The handbook is also quite good at explaining things like this."

"Hi, Collecting new Panther Black SQ5 in a couple of weeks and rather than spend money on the Audi A-Glaze treatment thought would do it myself. But don't want to go crazy will just thoroughly wash and clean but then just want to coat in decent wax to give adequate protection. Would probably prefer wax that you can put on a wet car but no expert in using these products would appreciate some advice. Heard Meguiar's Black Wax Paste and Bilt Hamber Double Wax are pretty good? On the other hand have read alarming articles that putting wax on a new car does nothing at all and builds up over time resulting in flaking and dullness to the paintwork and therefore you should useacrylic paint conditioner!!Thanks in advance."
"+1 for the GTechniq (Exo v2, C1,C2 etc.Although I had it done by an authorised detailer see sig."
"Thanks. The Chemical Guys Second Skin SS6 looks pretty impressive to me however, I think I would be nervous applying it as if the car wasn't completely clean it may seal over any marks etc.. Appreciate any views on this."
"I have a gtech cs applied....I've tried topping with the c2 but find it very hard to work with.I now gone back to good old faithful, zaino z5, z6 QD, finished with z8 grand finale.....the shine/feel is superb. (Daytona Grey)Steve"

"I am considering returning to a Q5. My average discount for a new one is 8.5%which is fine.However with the new model out later next year (probably September+) I have a few concerns.I can get a new Black Methos, 190 PS, Black pack with a other few toys on a S Line Plus for under 37K (without a sunroof)There is also a 15,15 plate (200 miles OTC) with a sunroof for £34 - 177 PS.It seems that the 177 is dead and the 190PS is the newer version which make me think that the engine size will not be relevant come exchange time.Coming from a Touareg RLine with a Sunroof I like the idea of the Sunroof. Consumption is not a concern.I am thinking that it maybe it's wise to wait out as my car is so similar to a Q5 anyway, or consider a completely different car.What are your thoughts?"
I'd wait for the new model.
"I'd wait for new model ,and some members have achieved 10.5% discount now,so if your gonna get brand new that extra discount will pay for the roof ????"
Not sure that members are actually getting 10.5% off the next generation model its probably off the current model. You will be lucky to get anything off the upcoming Q5 and you will have to wait months to take delivery. You pay your money and take your choice. Not sure I like the look of the next Q5 I think Audi were looking at the North American market with the new look. Its not for me. I am moving to an SQ5 in early September; Hope it was worth the wait!!
"Thank guys, I am waiting on another dealership as we speak, with a pan roof....I may be lucky....fingers crossed."
More like 12.5% off the existing model.
"Wilbur I've got 11.5% off an SQ5, getting it in late September. Went through drivethedeal - very easy and ended up with Dundee Audi who've been great to deal with so far. Reduced the waiting time too to about 3 months."
Drive was showing @13% on the SQ yesterday.
I got 8% on the new model
Deleted
"When we're talking about the 'new' model, is it just the new updated engines you're referring too ( 190ps v 177 for eg) or has some official announcement been made for the whole new look Q5 along same lines as the new Q7 ???"
"MK2 has not been previewed yet.Theres nothing new about the 187bhp engine from the A6, but why its not over 200bhp is strange in these times."
GuysWOW I will try configuring a car to see what discount I can get.Thanks
"Snow ManIm looking to order another Q5 where is the 12.5% deal from please, DTD are offering 11%Thanks"
"it was 13% the other day...it could well vary by model, i didn't check every model.Just looked again SQ is sat at 12.8% without options."
"From memory when I ordered mine in June, when you add options the discount is not as big on the extra cost of the options. So you pay nearer to the full list price for the options which slightly reduces the overall % discount on the 'package'."
"My discount was on car and options ,flat 10% ????"
"Just ordered a replacement Q5 S Line + with options, Got 11% discount for cash purchase and they also asked to be able to make an offer to take mine in PX come sale time.Very pleased."
Interesting observation at the showroom today. They reckon that when new Audi models are introduced they tend to be basic models so you have to spend money speccing it up with options. It takes some time before the special editions (e.g. S-Line plus') are introduced which offer more options as a value-for-money package. Can any long term Audi watchers confirm this?
"Basic, not sure i agree with that term...They will always be sport (was SE) and S-line, which is closely followed by the S.After that once sales start to slow, they add BE, plus etc etc."
Aye good review I just picked mine up today very happy just a shame I have to work and can't play with it.
"It's bout time it had a decent review,I still don't think there a better sports SUV to touch it value or performance wise,I still enjoy mine after 2years ,still makes me smile,and makes others wonder wats under the bonnet ????"
"From all my research, the only two cars that come close are X3 35D & Macan...The drive and interior of the macan is stunning, but with the additional options, the car is way too expensive and overall less practical.All in all, the SQ5 is the most practical, good looking performance SUV that money can buy.In addition, I found the handing (for my driving ability) perfect!"
"Test drove another sq5 today. Think generally I prefer my 3.0tdi. Other than what felt like a fairly small increase in acceleration, I tended to prefer the gearbox in my car and also the increased ride height. Sq5 was lovely, just not as much a difference as I hoped for.I was surprised however to see there are over 100 sq5's available on the Audi website - wow!!"
"There's definitely a lot more about now,there were 3 in my gym car park the other day,I'm surprised the ride height is that noticeable ????"
"Yep, it's only 30mm lower so would be surprised it's that noticeable.Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
"I found very little difference in price / comfort between SQ5 and Q5 3.0L TDI. The SQ5 is a little faster. I would suggest we all have different requirements, make your choice and pays your money."
"I felt the 8 speed gearbox to be much smoother than the 7 speed in the 3.0TDI.We actually only wanted a 3.0TDI to replace our 2.0tdi but the SQ5 had a quicker delivery date, very pleased now that we went for the SQ5 in the end."
I've tried to trade mine this week and had a huge shock!!!Two dealers didn't even want to buy it because they can't sell the ones they have?Oh well looks like I'll have to keep it... No real drama!
Yeah there seems to be quite a lot for sale at the moment. Sold mine about 7 weeks ago and the dealer still has it for sale and has reduced the price.
"Yet ""We buy any car"" are offering a price for my Q5 £1,500 above what I have agreed with the dealer for changing on Friday 4th September. I know they try to knock you down if they find anything wrong, but mine is spotless."
I guess as a lot of owners keep cars for around 2-3 years so its no surprise that there are a lot for sale at the moment as the SQ5 is around 2 years old now. I ordered a new one for September delivery and got over 10% discount which helps with the unavoidable depreciation. When its time to change it will probably trade in for another Audi as I did with my Q5 this time around which helped me negotiate a better deal.
"I'm estimating mine will b worth £30k retail when it hits 3 year old ,wich I'll b more than hapi with ,wich equates to just under £18 a day,well worth the money ????"
There are 115 for sale nationally on the approved Audi used site so there are a few to choose from. The prices being asked look quite high but I guess what they go for is another matter.
"TBH the prices look right to me, 115 cars across the national network including NI really isn't many. If you refine the search to include the essential Heated Seats/B&O & Sat Nav then there are just 43 cars available, much more realistic.I do think however with the more technology loaded 2015 Q7 coming on-line that its availability will accentuate the somewhat elderly Q5 platform and that won't help second-hand values for even properly spec'd vehicles let alone those cars with lowly option lists."
prices (trade) have hit 30k already..
"30k!! For a 2013 plate presumably? WOW got £27,000 for my 30 month old Q5!! But I think you need to take into account that if you want a prestige German performance car with similar performance/size to the SQ5 you will need to spend more money in the first place so overall depreciation on the SQ5 will still be better than what you get on a more expensive car. So overall you will not be out of pocket. Technically speaking that is. Furthermore the new Q7 which really isn't a good comparison starts at £50,000 and is slower than the current SQ5!!"
A bit late adding this to original post but the 3.0 TDI looks exactly the same as the 2.0 etc... Surely its better to have a car that stands out a bit so why not go for the SQ5?
But unless you take a SQ in at the same time as part of the same deal you have no real idea what that would mean.They may have given you over the book price for the car to make the deal...
I may be getting made redundant so I'm pretty alarmed at the minute to say the least!!!
Over book price for my Q5 plus 10.5% discount on a new SQ5 is just fine with me. £ not part of deal as dealer said if I want to sell my car privately that's fine and I will still get discount on new car.
"Well, not to nit-pick, but it's noticeably different from the back view"
"Test drove another sq5 today. Think generally I prefer my 3.0tdi. Other than what felt like a fairly small increase in acceleration, I tended to prefer the gearbox in my car and also the increased ride height. Sq5 was lovely, just not as much a difference as I hoped for.I was surprised however to see there are over 100 sq5's available on the Audi website - wow!!"
I think from most angles its different especially if you have 21's.
"It's like when you u bye a car,it's best not look on the trader a week later because you will always see a better deal ????"
"Just to temper some of the gloom, the market may not be as weak as feared. I just sold mine to an independent dealer for well over 40k (64 late, 5500 miles), so demand is clearly strong especially with the summer drawing to a close."
Just sold mine £41k 15 plate with 2500 miles to a main dealer
"I was offered 42,500 for mine, 15 plate 6k on the clock, book was 53 when i bought it though"
"Hi Guys I've just purchased my first Audi Q5 Sline and I'm over the moon with it, my only niggle is the ride it seems a little hard I was wondering if there is any way of soften it or dose it have to be done at the factory?Regards Paul"
Hi and welcome.What year is it.
WelcomeAnd what size wheels does your Sline have?
Is it new or second hand?Does it have s line sport suspension pack (which is a no cost option)?Have you checked the tyre pressure?Damper control optionmayimprove ride quality. I have not driven a Q5 with this option and doubt it makes much difference?
Welcome aboard ????
Yeah I'd say the short answer to this question is 'No' unless you've been incredibly lucky enough to unknowingly buy a 2nd hand model with damper control fitted.Sounds like you just have a model with S-line suspension as opposed to standard
Does the S-Line suspension come as standard on S-Line models or do you have to spec it?Ride on mine is ok for me although in and around town with all the speed bumps can be a bit rough at times.
"I believe it's standard by default, and you tick the box to change it to S-line if you want the firmer suspension"
I have S Line with standard suspension. I'd say it rides firm but not unbearably so. It does get a bit jiggly if the road is particularly bad though and I do try to avoid the worst patches whereas before my D3 would just glide over the ruts and bumps.
"Yes, default option on S line is standard springs & dampers with S line suspension being a no cost option. I have this which significantly improves body control without, IMO, compromising the ride significantly. All a matter of personal choice and the choice of set up will be influenced by where and how you plan to drive the vehicle."

"Hi thanks guys for all your input my is a 2012 which I bought 2nd hand it has 19"" wheels on I think it came with the Sline sports suspension but I'm not sure is there anyway I could check, I would agree with Zen123 mine is like that"
The code number in your handbook lists all the options. Your dealer should be able to check and tell you.
The code you need took for on the vehicle data sticker in the service book is1BVwhich signifies that you have sports suspension.
Thanks cruicd and missile for the info I'll go and check
"Pleased to help. I did have standard suspension on my S Line and now have sport on my SQ5.In all honesty, I am hard pushed to tell the difference in ride quality but I do notice less roll on the corners."

So very excited now got the collection date now 3rd of September 1pm. Can't wait!!.
Na towbar is hidden in bumper till needed got to get the mountain bike to the trails somehow. Also the mirrors on all other S models look good but if you put the SQ5 next to them they use cheaper plastic. It doesn't even look silver next to other models.
Ha ha caravan I would rather run over my mountain bike. Just like the look of body coloured mirrors plus never seen one like my order.
Can I just select photos from my photo library on iPhone or iPad as that's all I use when on this site.
"Ottawa, CanadaMy Q5 is off the assembly line and has left the plant. Should be arriving before August 11th.Can't wait as it seems no one has any 2016s yet!"
"I got my MY2016 SQ5 just over a week ago, not noticing much difference except for the addition of the AdBlue system."
"Enjoy it when it arrives, it's always a long, long wait once you've ordered."
"bobcash:Please spill the beans when your 2016 Q5 arrives and let us know where it's different than the 2015s. I ordered by Q5 3.0 TDI in Feb '15 to ensure I'd get a 2015 model for fear that the 2016s would be a redesign. I've seen alleged pics of the all-new Q5, and I don't care for it, inside or out. In my anything-but-humble view, the 2014/2015 Q5 is one of the most beautiful vehicles on the road, right down to the details of the front and back lights (I didn't care for the ""busy"" looking segmented LEDs in the 2013 or older)."
"Hi all,as a new owner to an Audi and coming from Subaru I notice some things which may be in order or not. The MMI either starts up or just goes to the radio randomly when you start the car. Is this normal?I've also had the pleasure of not being able to change the radio stations or the volume on the main MMI dial and volume control in the center console.I could change the volume on the steering wheel though. It was resolved when I turned the ignition off and on again.The handbrake wants to be released randonly as well, sometime you have to release it sometimes you don't.Sometimes when you come to a standstill the engine shuts off(as it should) and starts up again even though I have'nt taken my foot off the brake pedal.If anybody could give an answer I'd appreciate it. The dealership says all is hunky dory."
"Please be advised:If you switch off ignition whilst tuned to a radio station / media / telephone / map, MMI ought to reboot to the same function and control settings, e.g. volume when you switch the ignition on.If your MMI does not function correctly or respond to the controls, then it would appear you have a fault.Stop / start will cut engine only if engine is up to temp and the battery is charged.If you are stopped for a period of time the engine will restart."
Thanks for your response Missile.
Note that driver seat belt needs to be fastened for handbrake to release automatically.- Could that be what you have experienced?
Brake pedal can be very sensitive and start the engine with the smallest of movements sometimes.

Can anyone recommend good towing mirrors that won't scratch the mirror casing ?
I would also be interested in recommendations. Thanks
I use thesehttp://www.towsure.com/towsure-rock-steady-towing-mirrors-pairthey wobble a little but they are fine and don't mark the mirrors.Snowman and Raphster are just jealous of our hobo lifestyle. SQ5 and Coachman VIP living the dream.

Erm..... i like the silver trim on the grill.
"Tacky with a capital T, still its their choice but one does not account for taste!"
Errrrrrrrr.... kinda wish I could unsee that
Thats someones pride and joy....
"Not only is it gold, it's got a racing stripe too!"
First time I would recommend the black pack over the chrome trim
Chrome is for oldies and cars from the past century.I don't think anything would improve that gold Q5.
That's about the only thing you could do to make it look even worse!
Am I correct in saying that the Q5 quattro versions have a TDI quattro badge on the rear but SQ5's just have a TDI badge. I have no idea why but guess its down to symmetry with the Sq5 badge on the opposite side. Any views?
Save weight.. and improved aerodynamics.
I debadged the tdi bits on the basis that other S and RS models don't say TFSI so why should the SQ5 have to sat TDI. Nuts to the symmetry!
"That's because they are sports cars...The SQ is a TDi, it's nothing to be embarrassed about."
I had the both Q5 & TDi debadged. Wish I kept the Q5 badge as I think it looks a bit unbalanced. Might have to buy one and stick it back on.
Debadged TDI and the Quattro. Just useless very cheap pieces of plastic held on with self adhesive tape. The nice Q5 badge remains on the lhs. It looks far better (in my humble opinion). I'm not one of those who needs to let people behind me know every detail about the car in front.
"Now this may seem a bit basic but I may have a puncture and need to remove a wheel tonight in the dark so want to prep myself and without the car to hand maybe someone can help?I've never taken a wheel off a Q5 and don't think I have an Audi jack with the car as I don't have a space saver? but I do have a trolley jack and a spare that will fit whilst the tyre is being repaired/replaced.I have checked the forums and Google but can't find anything and the manual has frightened me by saying the jack must not be put anywhere other than the jacking point. I doubt a trolley jack will fit here, but is there a place to put the trolley jack which can be easily identified and is there anywhere that should be carefully avoided?"
Are you sure you don't have a jack?Even with the gunk I am sure they still expect you to be able to take the wheel off at some point
"I used the jack on the last car and its very feeble, to the point it actually moved while on the jack and to say i messed my pants is an understatement...Use with caution.."
Use your trolley jack with one ofthese.
Looks a useful bit of kit.
"This looks like a great addition to the tool box...Still unsure weather to visit dealer about my jacking point, maybe I worry too much!"
"Just renewing my insurance and esure have come out on top so went through their website and they now ask about factory fitted options that you have to declare.For some reason adding the tech pack, cruise control, air conditioning, bluetooth, privacy glass and my other options actually lowered the quote?I thought that telling them there were £000's of extra options above a standard car would mean a load on the premium but no it knocked £65 off - how does that work?"
If I remember correctly the tech pack includes parking sensors front and rear?Maybe this helps reduce low speed parking incidents?
Correct - I will play around with the quote engine and see if that's the case.
But the S-Line Plus has them as standard so they are not an extra on Chopper's model???
Entering my reg on eSures website correctly identifies it as the S-Line Special Edition but it is indeed when I tick the options that adding parking sensors drops the premium!
My insurance company dont care if I've got parking sensors or not. Just that they are factory fitted.
"My insurance quote was cheaper to insure parked outside, then in the garage......he explained why, however made no sense to me."
"Ah of course, because you can keep an eye on it parked in the road rather than the garage... hahaha."
"Just be careful about playing around adding options and then not including them. The Admiral group have a department looking for just this and if you have saved a quote with options you don't then declare they contact you. I had this a while back over upgrade wheels, they were meant to be on the quote I got the person to match when calling but they missed them. Hence it looked like I had saved a quote with the upgrade then went without - pretty smart of them though."
SQ has gone in to have a replacement climate control unit because the backlights have started to play up. To say they are brother and sister engines they are a world apart in terms of feel/performance - really surprised at the gap given the paper stats... Not a fan of the all gloss black inlays either - think id rather risk the soft all aluminium ones.. One other thing that struck me too was how uplifted the cabin is when you have two tone seats.
Even more so when teamed with the optional light colour headlining.
"I have to agree - couldn't decide whether it was the gearbox or the engine but probably a combination of the two, the Bi-Turbo with the 8 speed is just in a different leagueNot sure whether the new 272 PS engine is any better but very pleased we have the SQ5"
I'm saying the SQ feels much quicker and more powerful/responsive than the 30tdi does.I had to open the bonnet up and check it wasn't the 20tdi...
I agree I had an A5 with the 3.0tdi engine for about a year before I got the SQ5. The engine was very good but the SQ5 seemed a lot faster and I felt the 8 speed tiptronic was better too so can only assume the 3.0tdi Q5 would be even slower than the A5 with the same engine due to weight and size.

"Hi all,Had the new Q for just under 6 months and some arsehole has scraped into the rear side door and driven off.Scratches are right down the the metal and slightly dented as well. Colour is Daytona Grey pear effect.What would people suggest as a repair? Is this SMART repairable or is it worth going for a full body repair? Not sure how easy it will be to blend with pearl effect paint.Either way I think it's going to set me back a good few £. Fuming."

"Hi mate,I had a simular issue when my Q5 was about 6 months old, and I took it to my local Chips-Away. They were great - they did by the next day (after booking in) and even gave me a free courtsey car in the meantime. I was told as it was Ibis White it would be hard to blend but the job they did was spotless.Best of all it only cost me c.£150."

Hi all I just got a email today from Audi saying my SQ5 had entered the production phase. Any ideas on a guesstimate on how many weeks till delivery.
4 weeks.
Cool can't wait shouldn't be to long then.
Does anyone know if the password for Audi wifi is generic or if not how do I find out what it is. It's not that I need it but it keeps coming up on my phone and I'm just curious about it.
Go in to the settings on MMI and it gives you the wifi password. You can also change the password to whatever you wantSent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Cheers I'M off to try that now
Doesn't seem to be any password. I've found where you can set up a password for mmi but there isn't one there at themoment.

I have done the same. However these aftermarket LED kits are a bit of a rip off. If you buy your own LEDs it's cheaper and you can select higher quality and brighter LEDs with the latest LED technology (smd/cob etc) designs.

"I discovered the after-market LED options before I got my Q5, and fortunately for me, I decided to wait until after my Q5 arrived before I decided to upgrade. In the darkness of my garage, I tried each of the lights to satisfy 2 criteria:(1) Does the light do a good job illuminating its target(2) If the light became brighter and it was activated at night, would the driver be adversely affected while driving?I found I needed only 3 lights to be brighter, those being in my hatch area (2 sides, 1 on hatch).

"Just curious about if anyone complement (or consider to do) the MMI navi with phone apps like Waze, navigon-app, tomtom-app or others? Have you mounted the phone on the dash? If so, with what accessory?I've found audi connect service to lack a few things. Even if it is online it does not seem to be as up2date as other services out there. Services like Waze is great since police/radar-controls are reported and it's quite convenient to get the alert ahead. Likewise for traffic jams, animals on road or any other roadblock. Seems like it takes a while for audi connect (or google) to update with fresh data. Right now I use the MMI for navigation, but when driving farther I use Waze as well. Not dashmounted and only configured to Voice alerts over bluetooth which is quite good I must admit.What's your opinion? Would be great to get some input of your experiences and tips"
I was hoping to mount my phone on a Brodit mount to the left of the nav screen and use Waze in tandem to the standard navigation system. Trouble is the only Brodit mount I can find fits to the right of the steering wheel and I don't want to look left and right of the steering wheel continually. Anybody know of a mount that fits in the airvent to the left of the nav screen?(UK RHD Q5)

Thanks guys. I have ordered the Kenu Airframe+ from Amazon as it looks to fit closer to the satnav and is under a tenner.
"I have one of those, bought it before the magnet holder. It's good but not as good as the magnet holder, especially for large phones like the iPhone 6 Plus or Samsung equivalent and you need 2 hands to fit and release the phone."
For some reason I didn't fancy putting a magnet close to my phone (Note 3) but I will bear it in mind if I don't get on with the Airframe+Thanks
The Airframe+ works great. At least with my iPhone 6. Very convenient solution and very easy to snap in/out. Never had any troubles and a very discrete solution.
"Thats going to be a tight fit (note 3) especially if you use a case.

Hi I'm looking to fit a towbar for my q5. It's already got the twin exhaust rear bumper so there is a removable panel in the middle. I liked the look of the bosal detachable but it looks to close to the bumper. Has anyone fitted one ? Also could I fit a sq5 rear bumper easily enough ?
We had a bosal detachable on our first Q5. It was fine and worked OK with our Caravan's AL-KO stabiliser hitch which is pretty big.

"Hi all,Some unfortunately souls on our estate have had the misfortune of having their OEM Sat Nav units stolen. Damage and replacement costs are running into the £000's. This has mainly affected older Audis and some newer VW units. Apparantly there is a security flaw in some in that they are not coded to the car and as such can be retrofitted to many other VW's and are being sold on ebay.5 have gone in the last 2 two weeks alone. I have not been able to find any evidence of units being took from the Q5 but wondered if anyone on here had any more knowledge about the vulnerabilities and which units specifically are affected?"
Theft of ICE has long been a problem - since before I was born. E Bay provides a ready market for second hand knock off goods. Second hand Q5 sat navs are currently advertised for sale on eBay.
"A bit of further reading suggests that the MMI is not a target as the unit is not one easily nickable unit and the screen is very difficult to get out.Already have a German Shepherd, CCTV and 6 foot gates so not really much more I can do, except for looking into one of the supaglass films, but a little concerned what that might do in the event of needing to get out the car in an emergency."
Sat nav is no difficult to remove if you know how and particularly when they will not give a s....t about damaging your car. On a.n.other forums there are several reports of sat nav thefts from Audis.
Its the RNS-E versions of the NAV unit being stolen round us.
It is same process to remove and steal whatever version is installed.
I thought the MMI screen was just that and the hard drive was in the glove box and the controls are next to the gear lever? Is the MMI one whole unit?
"The older one piece units are certainly easier to steal, however the newer units are more valuable. I have been told, some thieves will steal to order.The thieves know what components comprise the ICE, where they are located and how to remove them. You will see all the components comprising the latest HDD version of MMI fitted to the Q5 are available via eBay."
Ron Dennis hired a set of scousers as his new pit crew. They removed the wheels in record time and had them for sale on eBay within 24 hours.

I can't say I was shocked - I was surprised she'd lasted nearly 3 months!!Anyway - she took it to a local wheel specialist, who said they could fix it - but they'd have to send it away for around a week.

FTFY:
Unless it is a very shallow defect? you need to skim quite a bit off the wheel. I did a DIY repair on my wife's diamond cut alloy and am very pleased with result.
JP Alloys messed my M3 wheels up!!!
Thanks for the replies. My local Audi dealer say they send it to Perth to get fixed and they do a seamless job. I think the company my wife went to send the wheel to the same place.The quote was £170 - but that includes taking the tyre off and sending it. My only additional cost will be an axel stand for the week whilst my car lives in the garage!The video looks scary. I'll have one wheel thats lighter than the rest!Ha ha... I'm not that sadistic!!
"Got call from dealer today and said that the car I ordered for September delivery is already at some port in the UK. He even jokingly said the factory must have fitted it with a jet engine as its here so quick.Which got me thinking. The MY2016 has a 190PS engine whereas previously they were 177PS, so how can I know for sure that it is fitted with the newer engine?"
Just checked the V5 - it's not on there. Will you be picking it up before September or will you wait?
"What week was it built in? Did they tell you when you ordered it. The MY2015 to MY2016 change was due to take place around week 22 (Week commencing 25th of May), My SQ5 was originally scheduled for this build week but I moved it back to week 26 in order to get a factory fitted towbar added to the spec.Your dealer should be able to tell you exactly which build week it was in and which MY model it is, they have it on their system as I have screenshots of mine from the Sales Admin"
I ordered car on 29th May. I vaguely remember the salesman saying something about week 20. The next time I called it was week 26 and locked.
"Has anyone used or anyone got any experience of these? Car is in at the dealers and they have advised on 4 new tyres - these are all they can get in for tomorrow. Fitted price is really good, but I don't want ditch finders!!! Has anyone had them? Assume they must be OK if a dealer is happy to fit them."
Why on earth would you use a main dealer for tyres? How much are they charging?http://www.mytyres.c...rn&typ=R-270617Not much feedback on them.
Because that's where the car is at the moment and all 4 are on the limit. The dealer has priced them at £122 each fitted which is ok - even if I only get a few months out of them. I wouldn't normally use a dealer - but they are pretty good to be fair. I had some warranty paintwork sorted out last week and they also resolved some non warranty paintwork FOC.
The tyres I'm getting are Nexen N'Fera RU5s
Here is a review but your size is not listed they look okhttp://reviews.tirebuyer.com/3433/65252/reviews.htm
I didn't have any alternatives off the shelf in fairness as two of the tyres had worn badly - so if nothing else at least it'll be legal! Getting them to check the 4 wheel alignment whilst they've got it.
Can the MMI system accept any type of SD card or is there a maximum class/speed etc?

Yeah I was reading that some have a 64GB SD card working. Just need to find one to test now.
White for sure and drop the black pack - unless you are a drug dealer.Hill hold?
"Personally speaking I think the black pack is simply hideous however like most things its down to personal choice, its your money after all. Rear bench seat Plus and Hill Hold would be options I'd add, both worth having and not expensive.The standard interior aluminum trim is notoriously easy to scratch/dent so you might want to consider something else? Piano black maybe? Alloy protection cover - on 20"" wheels you get decent tyre sidewalls so its unlikely you will curb the wheels, save your money."
"Agree with Sq5john,However alloy wheel protection depends on your previous experience and how careful you are. >In 6+ years Q5 ownership I have never kerbed an alloy. For me alloy wheel protection would be a waste.My niece has managed to kerb all 4 alloys in 9 weeks on her Q3. For her alloy protection is worth it."
"Get your dealer to match internet price for GAP, I paid £180 for 3 years on SQ5,and add high beam assist ,it's £110 ,the range on theQ5 head lights is pony ,I'd say go 4 white,black only looks clean for 1 day ????????"
"I'm not keen on the white or a fan of the black pack and would favour Mythos, even wished we'd gone for Panther Black over Estoril Blue despite having had a Phantom Black Q5 before.Agree with the Hill Hold, High Beam Assist and bench seat plus, although I think the bench seat plus can add rattles (ours does at 30K miles) we have all the insurances and will be using the wheel one at some point as the Mrs has caught one of the fronts (we didn't pay for them however and I don't have any on my S3)"
would agree that its very easy to mark the standard aluminium trim - just putting keys down is all that's needed
"Go for black colourPersonally I think the black pack only succeeds in making the car look cheaper, whatever colour you go forBut I guess it's a personal choice"
Which Internet company quoted £180?
"It was the 1 that had an advert on this forum,however other members had an even better deal with FRANK PICKLES GAP ????"

"Have a look at car2cover too, their policy was the most comprehensive I found when looking and I will use them again. Particularly if you want tyre insurance too, which you wont be able to get on its own. Frank Pickles also have a good GAP policy, but I don't think they offered tyre insurance if I remember correctly."
"Thanks guys, have ordered the glacier white with black styling pack.Also added hill assist and black piano trim.Have been told delivery is end if September."
HiI am about to order a q5 from my dealer however when working out the discount should this be before or after vat? The dealer worked out the discount before the vat but I was expecting it after the vat?Many thanks
"Before the VAT, always.The tax is calculated based on the value of the goods.As a matter of interest VAT is calculated on the profit on a used car..."
"Yep just divide the total cost including VAT by 1.2 then take off the discount then add back on 20% VAT and that should be it... be sure to get at least 10% discount though, good luck. Ps the On The Road £ will not be included in this calculation and should be added on after."
"Discount is always before VAT. As andy said in practice it makes very little difference, however additional items like delivery charge, are not discounted."
"Thanks guys for explaining, I am expecting 10% discount but I think they also included the £500 pcp contribution into it. Should the pcp contribution be additional discount?"
Try for both......
"£500 PCP contribution from Audi is a nice bonus. You have negotiated a cracking deal, well done. Is it worth arguing over 10% of £500"
"AhhhhWhen they offer PCP contributions it tends to be offset with tinkering elsewhere in the deal, are you trading another vehicle in or is this a clean deal?"
A discount and discounted VAT - i like that idea.I don't think the sales are that bad even with the new model next year!
Savings percentages are always better when you include the VAT saved. I got around £5000 off my SQ5 but in reality that has saved me £6000 as I have also saved £1000 in VAT.
I do have a vehicle but audi trade in value is nit great so will try and sell privately
"Got my renewal for the SQ5 in, wanting £425. With ElephantA few mins on the comparison sites pops up a good quote from Admiral as it always does. Quick call to Elephant who make a long call which always end yes we can meet that.So, £204 for a 313ps motor worth plenty of money isn't bad at all."
"It's worth reading the small print on insurance quotes, many of the cheaper companies reserve the right to repair your vehicle in the event of an accident with pattern non genuine Audi parts.We can all make use of the Audi Ensurance servicehttps://insurewithaudi.co.uk/products/Ensurance/and get the vehicle repaired at an Audi approved bodyshop, the catch being that the insurance company will withdraw the replacement vehicle if it isn't repaired in their own bodyshop which rather takes the shine off the Audi offer."
"That's a pretty good quote. I was happy when I got mine down to £260 fully comp, driver and spouse only with guaranteed NCD from LV. They did insist though that I had a Tracker fitted and I got the dealer to do this FOC with one year subscription thrown in. Not impressed with Vodafone (nee Cobra) so far though. Anyone else had the same experience?"
"And Admiral and Elephant are the same company under the covers, so was always going to be matched..."
And they ownconfused.comso they usually rank pretty high there. Been with them for years and generally happy enough with them.

Has anyone bothered to take out the 4th year warranty when purchasing a new car? I see that the 4th year for SQ5 is £535 which seems reasonable value but being 3 years away from usage is it worth it? Assume if you wait until end of 3rd year then buy the 4th year warranty it will be a lot more than £535.
i took it as i got my same 10% discount as i got off the car but dont think it was as expensive as that.small price to pay for an extra years manufacturers warranty which is also transferable and come first mot could just about pay for itself if there are any failure items.never run a car without a warranty so normally sell after 20-22 months which financially is crazy so an extra years motoring for a few hundred pounds
Is it better to take it out at point of buying new or when the 3 years is nearly up.The salesman didn't even bring it up when I was ordering the car and I never thought to ask about it.
My salesperson stated discount didn't apply but there again she also said she didn't think it was worth handing over that much cash (even more for 5 years worth) to Audi so far in advance. You pas your money (or rather you don't) and you takes your chances ..............
"I don't think it's worth taking out 3 years in advance,anything can happen in the 3 years,ie write off,stolen,you might need to sell,and it's not that much dearer to take out at end of 3rd year,when my Audi A5 3 litre cab became 3 years old,it was only £600 to extend for a further year,witch @ £50 a month for a car that was £50k new I think was reasonable ????"
Yes think unless you are likely to save loads of money then giving Audi more £££ on day one is probably not worth it. Assume at a 4th year warranty for an SQ5 will be a lot more than a A5 Cab 3.0 though?
"Maybe ,maybe not as my A5 cab was similar price to my SQ,I don't no what they base extended warranty price on ,I mean there's just as much to go wrong on either car ????"
i took out the additional 2 years as the intention when i bought the car (and still is if i stay strong) was to keep it for 5 years so it made sense for my circumstances.
Does anyone with a 3 year old car know how much it is now?
"Just picked up a Q5 brochure, it says that 4th year warranty is only available before the car is first registered."
Does anyone know the £ for a 4th year warranty on a Q5 as should be about the same as if you take out the 4th year on a new car today its will cost £535 for both the Q5 and SQ5?
"from memory It would have been about £600 for our old Q5, we didn't bother In the end and ran the car out of warranty for 7 or so months before we ordered our SQ5you can check the costs on the Audi website for an Audi extended warranty - go to the owners section and then enter your reg and mileage"
"I was not sure if I would own the car beyond three years and decided I would reconsider as and when 3 year warranty was due to expire.Please note you cannot arrange Audi extended warranty part way through your 3 year ""free"" warranty. You can arrange before purchase or after your warranty has expired > ""Sorry, but we only offer extended warranty on vehicles that are outside their manufacturers warranty."""
Yes just tried it with my reg and it said unable to extend due to car not outside warranty!! Assume will be around £600 so probably not worth spending £535 3 years early as it can still be taken out when the car is 3 years old. Cheers.
"Just out of interest, I plugged in details for my old Q5 into Audi website:I was quoted £611.90 / £782.23 for all component warranty with £250 / £100 excess.I was quoted £446.29 / £561.41 for all component warranty with £250 / £100 excess."
"If I keep my car after three years, I may take the £446.29 quote. I didn't have any issues with my previous Q5, but like all insurance policies, one hopes never to make a claim."
The main thing I am interested in covering is the gearbox. Mechatronic unit failures have eye watering quotes to replace them yet this policy has a £2000 limit which is way below what some members have been quoted to replace?
"Took out extra 1yr (so warranty cover for 4yrs). Itcouldbe a selling point (it's transferable), but I essentially wanted piece of mind too and will look to replace around 3-4 yrs old. With the amount of gearbox issues going around I'm so glad I did this. This is only available when purchasing from new registration, I'm not sure if the additional warranty you buy at 3 yrs is as comprehensive (but welcome other feedback to the contrary)"
Has anyone bothered to take out the 4th year warranty when purchasing a new car? I see that the 4th year for SQ5 is £535 which seems reasonable value but being 3 years away from usage is it worth it? Assume if you wait until end of 3rd year then buy the 4th year warranty it will be a lot more than £535.
From what I have read those who are unfortunate enough to need a replacement mechatronic / gearbox have the work completed at no cost even after warranty has expired.........provided they have a full Audi service history.
I am guessing here but it seems that £535 with no excess today may be the better deal as Extended Warranty when the car reaches 3 years seems to have Excess premiums added. Some dealers give the same discount on this as they did on the car and some don't. As I got 10.5% discount if this is applied to the £535 then its probably worth doing it from day one?
The post-purchase extended warranty is more of an insurance policy whereas the extended Audi warranty bought at 1st registration is just that - an extension of the Audi new vehicle warranty you had for the first 3yrs.
"The quote Audi gave me after 3 year on my A5 ,still didn't have an excess ,but if I opted for a lower cover warranty it would of had an excess ????"
Some do indeed - after a protracted fight!
Was Panther Black always available for the SQ5 from the start or was it introduced sometime after the cars 2013 debut in the UK?
Introduced from start. Panther Black and Estoril blue were the two crystal effect colours available from launch spring 2013. Estoril was then exchanged for Sepang for MY15 but Panther is still available. On the colour topic Daytona grey was not available for SQ5 until MY15. Monsoon grey were the closest to match at launch.
"I've managed to narrow my search down to 2 cars, based on mileage, spec and the deal I've managed to broker (over the phone) with the seller.One car is Sepang Blue, the other is White.. Decisions decisions..."
Gotta say that black pack really suits sepang ????
"I think so too but it's all down to choice. I like different also, hence in part my seats."
Sepang...BP just makes the car look cheap and unfinished..
"Sepang, such a nice coluorBlack pack also, not a fan of the chrome, although the rear diffuser then needs painting I think as the light grey looks odd against the black trim"
"I'm a liker of white obviously.Are these new cars or used, if used you would need to view to see which is in the best condition. If new are they same price same spec?"
Both are used and condition is 'as new' but with different specs. I have also had an interesting conversation with two dealers about new. They have some cars that are built and available if spec is right. If the price is right I could be tempted.
If the spec and condition is identical then...Between Ibis White & Sepang I would go for the Sepang.Between Glacier White & Sepang I would go with Glacier White.
I've gone for Sepang
"You made the right choice, sepang looks superb.White also nice, but a bit girlie IMO.."
Seepang and no BP. Vote and check out the most common colours in the post below.http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/3174-poll-what-colour-have-you-gone-for-and-why/page__st__120
Do you really need to be in 'Dynamic' mode to get the best sound from the Active Sound Exhaust as assume even at low speeds idling etc.. you still have the burble?
If you haven't spec'd Drive Select then the exhaust noise is only available in Sport mode.
I have specced Drive Select but assumed the general burbling would be around whatever mode car is in?
"Not so John I can have the noise in every mode except economy,via the drive select button ,I assume we all can,the setting up for this is in the MMI ????"
"Sorry to hijack the topic but sort of related... SQ-BEAST, do you find that some days/in certain driving conditions you really notice the difference between comfort/dynamic steering setting in ADS and other times not?I had a long drive a couple of days back and on the way out I had comfort steering and the way back dynamic steering set. Lots of 30 - 50mph twists and turns and it was really noticeable but when I programmed it I was driving round a big car park at 0-20mph and struggled to notice a difference in any mode."
"I stand by what I wrote there, if you have an SQ and haven't spec'd DS or (hacked it using VCDS) then the Dynamic exhaust noise is only present in Sport mode via the transmission shifter..."
"Agree, unless you have ADS you cant control the noise. Its present only to work in sport mode with none ADS cars.Dynamic vs Comfort - hardly any difference between the two from a steering point of view."
Its sounds a bit odd to me as when I tested the SQ5 as soon as I turned the ignition key I heard the roar of something special. Admittedly when we got going I checked and it was set for Dynamic so plenty of burble but it was still burbling when idling. Does the Dynamic mode affect idling sound as well?
"Yes, the Dynamic noise is there at idle."
Let me get this right. When the car is in 'Dynamic' mode its burble all the time but when its in any other mode there is no burble when idle or when using the throttle? To sum up no Dynamic no burble?
Does anyone know who can set up this via MMI in the Blackburn area.

"Sorry Jon I misunderstood,I thought you said the noise was only available in sport mode ????"
Thanks very much for taking the time to clarify this its very helpful to me and much appreciated. Great forum....
"And if you do like the noise,you may want to increase the burble with a sound booster,it's a 5 min install and gives more throaty ness ,my mates say it sounds like a HEMMI, there around £400, or £200 secondhand ,worth the £ I think,it really does make people wonder what lump is under the hood ????http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/13698-sq5-sound-boosters/page__fromsearch__1"
just drive it in sport mode
"Sport mode is very aggressive on the gear change, much nicer to have the dynamic exhaust and comfort gearbox settingSent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
"Further to what SQ5BEASTY1 said about leaving it in 'AUTO' does this mean that the burble from the exhaust will be automatically switched on/off depending on your driving style, or have I misunderstood this?"
You've misunderstood thisSound is off in 'Efficiency' modeSound is on in 'Dynamic' (will also have gearbox in sport but you can putt the gear leaver to switch back to drive)Sound can be on or off in 'Auto' depending on how you have set Drive SelectI cant remember what comfort even does as I never use it
Do you really need to be in 'Dynamic' mode to get the best sound from the Active Sound Exhaust as assume even at low speeds idling etc.. you still have the burble?
"If I spec ADS on the SQ5 I am in the process of ordering will the modes such as economy or comfort have slightly softer suspension? I'm clear on the other features of ADS from the above thread, particularly SQ5BEASTY1's post.Dealer told me today it will do but if I don't spec ADS then the drive mode presumably does not have softer suspension.Is this accurate? There isn't an option for adaptive dampers. Basically want an option with a softer suspension setting for the bumpy UK roads!"
"Ok thanks for clarifying that, new to this forum but several hours of reading threads in the last week has shown me that there is a lot more knowledge on here than the Audi dealers have!On paper you are probably right about model choice but I'm committed to the SQ5 now - partly chose it for the look and engine, not just practical reasons! The test drive was fine for bumps etc so should be fine. May reconsider ADS now.Thanks!"
ADS is a toy which I never use.

"ADS does or would control damper setting, but the SQ5 is not available with adjustable dampers - hence the comments and the confusion with the printed information."
"People get confused thinking the £220-odd ADS system will adjust the dampers, but it wont unless you also spend another £600-odd on the adjustable damper option.(Think I've just repeated what Snow man said)I like ADS however as it definitely adjusts and tightens up the steering in Dynamic,I set it to Dynamic steering with Comfort gearbox. Perfecto!"
"Comfort everything with dynamic exhaust for me, but put everything into economy in traffic jams. If i need to squirt into a gap, I just knock the gearbox into sport."

"Got a phone call from the dealer today with an update on my order. Firstly the guy I ordered the car from had left the dealership so the chap who will take over introduced himself to me and secondly was told that my car was now in week 26 and ahead of schedule so could be with the dealer late July early August.As its so so close to September, which was originally what I was expecting anyway, should I ask them to postpone registration till then or just take the car if it turns up in August? Would it adversely affect future residuals if I did collect it in August?"
"Take it, life's too short to worry about a number plate, if residual value is a concern then truly don't buy a new car at all, its a terrible investment...."
"If it July take it,if it was mid August I'd wait ????"
"If it's early August, take it. I would wait if delivery was due mid Aug. The wait gets worse when you know you could be driving it. Mine is available now but I cant collect until next week."
That's what the wife said. I'll see when the dealer calls and tells me it's in and decide then.
I doubt it makes much difference to resale value and certainly don't care about new reg plate one up man ship
"It wouldn't as a trade in, which is the more likely scenario, but I think it would add ££'s on a private sale..just a bit of psychology at play."
I would wait 65 plate the only reason I'm not now even is because the deal I've had warrants it

"I had one of the very first Q5 TFSIs to be delivered to the UK. I found it very reliable and did not have any issues like you have described.As with any second hand vehicle you need to examine it carefully. Some low mileage examples will be used and abused, while others will have been well cared for. Take a friend or employ AA / RAC to inspect the car if you are not confident that you can spot a lemon."
"Carbon fibre build up - you could make money off that one..Carbon build up is a huge problem on the TFSI engines and is due to the way they work. its claimed to have been fixed by a redesign just prior to the period you are looking at - only time will tell.Other issues, never heard of those before, but the car is in warranty so shouldn't be a issue to get corrected if thats the case."
I know its not a big deal but notice that maximum torque for the MY2016 EU6 SQ5 now starts at 1400 RPM instead of 1450. Assume this is a good thing to enable max torque earlier down the rev range and probably helps with the increased MPG?
What is the new alledged MPG ????
35.3/42.8/47.9
This is probley due to the addition of Adblue.
Why would injecting pig's piss into the exhaust affect performance or economy?
Just wondering what products folk use for keeping their leather seats clean and conditioned? Have read that Gliptone is supposed to be decent but not heard of it at all before?

"Just wondering how many of you are waiting for the next gen q5 before swapping ??i really can not decide what to do ? Mine will be three years old in May next year...do i order a new one now, upgrade to an Sq5 or wait for the next gen??Suppose deals on current cars might get better but depreciation aint going to be as goodwhats your thoughts everyone?"
I'd wait till next gen now ????
"I'd look at the deals available then look at whats known at that point in time.Right now, nothing is known about the next gen. You might not like the new one, you might find the price has rocketed... you just never know."
"The new one is bound to have the ""sticky-out"" satnav, which I personally think looks like it has been added as an after thought.Faced with the same dilemma I did the sums and decided to change sooner rather than later - I pick the new one up in September."
"I no wat u mean bout the sticky out sat nav,me son had on his MERC CLA,it does look like an aftermarket add on,but it seems there all going that way,progress not perfection ????"
did you go like for like or upgrade ?dilemma is trading this year/early next might mean wanting to trade again in a years time for the new model and that sounds costly ...we will prob all like the new one ;-)
New regulations apparently about satnavs having to be no lower than a certain amount below your natural eye line.
"I'm having a similar dilemma. But, if you wait for next gen, you then see/hear about the next big thing and wait for that, and on and on.. I say if you like it go for it, in a couple of years the next big thing will be old news and there will be a new 'new kid on the block' to aspire to. I'm going for it now and will change in a couple of years, maybe for another Q5, maybe something completely different."
"Yeah thats sort of where im at aswell...Normally when the next gen comes out theres a few issues to iron out, No discounts available, long waits and the Plus/Special editions always come out about a year later . Hopefully just in time for me"
wisewords !!! In your opinion was the switch to the SQ worth it ?
Well I don't actually do the swap until September but I have no regrets moving up. I think the SQ5 is going to be one of those cars that sits firmly in Muscle Car Territory and even though its a bit long in the tooth now I think that makes it even more appealing as its all about the fun and as such I think it will become the James Dean of cars one day!! Slight exaggeration but you know what I mean.
"Hi, It seems from a past thread that SupaGard protection (unless free) is probably not worth it. However a few owners have said that other paint protection may be worth the effort so interested to know if anyone in the Essex/London area has had their new Panther Black SQ5 professionally detailed and whether it was worth the £/Effort?Cheers"
"I had my panther SQ5 detailed - and I will have it again when my RS6 arrives, C1 and ExoIts definitely worth it - Supagard and Autoglym are useless whether free or notParticularly on black cars, you will need to be careful with who you use to wash it (better you do it yourself), swirls and light marring are really noticeable if washed with anything but the most careful process, particularly when you marvel at how unbelievable panther looks in the sun - which you will !"
"Hi, Can you let me know who did it and where they are based and the £.Cheers"
pm sent
I had the Autoglym included free and it all depends who does the job. Mine was well done and a good job. I fully expected it to need a full detail very quickly but the sealant lasted really well and probably better than my other car which had Gtechniq from new.
"You could also get your car detailed and then apply the C1 and/or Exo yourself. But I would recommend Chemical Guys SS6 (Second Skin) over the Gtechniq, especially if applying it yourself (much easier), and you get a much bigger bottle."
Have a look at Nanolex Si3DSent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Having a great quality drying cloth and spraying the car with Autoglym quick detailer before you dry it off helps with the swirls also.
What drying cloth do you use I normally go for a decent chamois? What about Augoglym Surface Detail Clay have you also used this as getting a Panther Black car so want to prepare myself for cleaning.
"I wonder if recent and future legislation aimed at greater taxing of diesel cars, will encourage some retro style big bore petrol projects.. I'd like to see how Audi would approach building an RSQ5, and what engine might go into such a beast. Probably a pipe dream, but........4.0 T from the RS6?"
That would b a real WEAPON ????
"Audi said they had no current plans for an RSQ5.If they did followed their existing models i'd guess it would be the 30T V6 with the drive for downsizing, the V8 4.2 thats in the RS5 won't survive going forward."
"That's why I thought the 4.0T from the RS6 and RS7 might be the one they'd go for.... The 3.0T wouldn't improve performance over the SQ5, as can be seen in the US version. I for one would love to see a Q5 that could compete with Merc's large capacity petrol range.. But, I fear Audi will leave this to the current RS line up."
"The platform/ranges are in steps, the 6/7/8 engines won't come down to the 4 and 5 series cars. the 40T will never hit the RS5 is my reading.it would just be a bigger turbo with some internal changes."
Even though I have ordered an SQ5 my only concern is that is a very old shape now and perhaps is starting to look a little dated. Having said that because its good looking car I think it has/will age well even though the new Q5's front grill is very different as for the back it looks the same to me from the pictures I have seen. Where I think the SQ5 will probably benefit is that its the last in a line of good Q5 stock and therefore may become more desirable in time...... or am I just dreaming??
Personally not too bothered about technology as 313PS and 479lb of torque is plenty for me.....
"Have seen the brand new Q7 (one of only 2 in the country currently + doing a tour of dealerships), and am told that the new Q5 will look very similar, albeit smaller!Sorry I've no photo's to show but it's certainly more angular from the front (as per new A3 etc.), rear is perhaps slightly less rounded and a few more body creases on the sides make it look a bit more erm...aggressive?Interior looked to be very high class - foldaway satnav system + dials and knobs a good facelift from current designs.Downside is we're probably 18 months or longer away from seeing the new Q5 version."
"Its 7 years old, what do you expect - things never stand still.Nothing ever goes up in terms of modern desirability... resale will plunge without a doubt."
The above image is based on a photoshop of the RSQ3 but given the registration its been given is more likely to be a Q1 render
I'm not liking this very muchHaven't yet seen a new Q7 but based on this and other similar images I've seen we'll be looking elsewhere unfortunatelylets hope its better in the flesh
I quite like it...a bit sportier looking..
Looks ok but I don't think it will age as well as the current shape
It might be just but I like the current look better!!
"Its the Q1, but i like it... modern and sharper."
I just hope the SQ7 is available and more attractive in a couple of years when I get bored of my SQ5!
You better sell up quick then!!!

There are plenty of Q7 movies on Audi Media around for those that need to look at one:https://audimedia.tv/en/vid/the-new-audi-q7-footageIt doesn't look that great (sounds good though) but it's miles better than the previous version
"Fortunately being retired virtually all my driving is for pleasure including a number of trips to the continent. As for depreciation, yes you are right but have done quite well with the Q5 as at £70 per week depreciation it was much cheaper than leasing etc.. Obviously the SQ5 will depreciate more quickly but I think I will hold onto this one for along while as can't imagine what my next car could be."
Just imagine if Audi do not bring a SQ5 to their new Q5 range..... Depreciation? What depreciation? Only joking with Audi's main rivals developing bigger and faster SUV's they are duty bound to compete so I expect a fire breathing SQ5 sometime in the next couple of years.

If you must have paint protection then I would take it to a proper detailer who will do apply whatever product you go for properly. They will correct the paintwork for any swirls and scratches before applying the protection. It's not cheap but worth it in the long run.
"My 64-plate was done with the newer ceramic based Supagard and before discount they wanted £699. As you can imagine I didn't pay that but good luck getting it chucked in for free as its worth having, especially with you colour.Of course you go for a partial or full wrap SQ Beast style! But that's another price point altogether!"
+1 on the detailer (and paint protection products). Where I take my cars (see sig and check out New Car Detail) the guy has a passion for it and it takes a day. I don't expect the person doing it at an Audi dealer has either.

With the imminent arrival of the new SQ5 I now need to consider Comprehensive Insurance. Does anyone have any suggestions and what sort of premiums should I expect?
"Depends on numerous different things like age, experience, previous claims, NCD, location, storage overnight, mileage, cars in household, how many clouds in the sky.. Insurers are a law unto themselves. I paid more for my SQ than any previous car despite owning other performance cars of high value and having 10+ years NCD etc etc. I tried every company on the market and ended up at nearly a Monkey. Wasn't impressed."
"Have a think about the question for moment. Insurance cost is dependent on where you live (post code driven), your age, occupation, driving record, accident history, intended use of the vehicle and who else is likely to be on the policy.For myself, aged 57, IT consultant, living in the midlands clean licence, no own fault claims in the last 5 years, 18,000 miles a year inc business use, garaged, fully comp with Zurich for substantially less than £300."
"Postcode def plays a massive part, people in Dorset seem to have the cheapest,there was a 27 year old calls jose with an SQ who was paying under £400 ,I'm 44 and pay just over £400 with 10year NCB ????"

Not much over £200 for my SQ5 and generally insurance rates here in Northern Ireland are high. Bargain!
That has got to be the cheapest on the forum ????
Yea it's pretty amazing. Aged 46 excellent no claims record and with Admiral. Think it's about £230.
"SQ5 is really cheap, you should be fine with whoever."
Also with Admiral through compare the market and am paying £237
"Admiral - check the small print, they reserve the right to repair your car with pattern parts, i.e. non Audi items."
See my previous thread above but FWIW - actually ended up going multi-car policy with Hastings Direct - £400 ish for both SQ5 + VW Golf TSI Cabriolet.
"I'd beg to differ SM. Most insurers I spoke to quoted much higher than other performance cars I've owned down the years. Apart from the almost acceptable cost of my current insurance, 90% of the others were astronomical!"
Whereas the Admiral group undoubtedly offer cheap quotes I would add a word of caution in the event of making a claim. I used them for one of my kid's cars as they were much cheaper for a young owner driver than the mainstream insurers but the hassle we had when making a claim was significant and I would be reluctant to insure with them in future. If however you never need to claim they are definitely a cheap option.
Direct Line gave me a good deal.
"£220 with Direct Line. That was not the cheapest, but prefer to stick with a well known company. Mind you, I am an old fart with a fairly good postcode!!"
LV good for me. £260 with protected McDonald's.
Ehhh? NCD should read.
With the imminent arrival of the new SQ5 I now need to consider Comprehensive Insurance. Does anyone have any suggestions and what sort of premiums should I expect?
do they deliver or is it drive through only
"The sq5 seems to b holding well,the cheapest in the BIBLE (autotrader) is £39500 on a 13 reg,so for a car of nearly 2 years old that cost aprox 48k with that spec,it's looking good ????"
"Hmmm, but thats not really an indicator. You are confusing sale price and worth.Look at the cheap one reg ending DHP, yes it has an ""asking"" price at the dealers of £39k, but its only worth £33.5k - thats all you will get for it."
"I agree trade would b different,but as a guide for retail there holding quite well ,i always retail my cars so 39k ish ain't bad ????"
If the screen price of my car is £39k in 2 years I'll be happy.
"Cheapest on the trader 13 reg £37k , not bad for 2 year old ,good residues still ????"
Supply and demand at work then
"As above, if retail is holding up high then trade value is doing the same. Good news for us owners."
Reported SQ7 Due UK January-March 2016.Not Years away as some suggested after New Q7 launch.May explain SQ5 production halting.
SQ5 could become a modern cult classic? Don't think I will be rushing to buy an SQ7.
Cheapest one in Oz is $80k for a 2013 model. Which is roughly £40k. We are lucky that as a 4wd SUV it gets taxed as a commercial vehicle when imported. An A6 with the same engine is $40k more expensive when new.
"What is the story on SQ5 production halting? Wasn't planning on a refresh soon, but..."
yes I must of missed a post on SQ5 production being halted as well
Well I never a nearly new SQ5 at a Car Supermarket for £40k.http://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201505253755970?atmobcid=soc3
"Just ordered new SQ5 for delivery this September (MY16) with nearly £6,000 of options for £46,000. That's around 10.5% under list. Think that beats the Autotrader car which has 7000 odd miles and 20'' wheels and on a 2014 plate. Whats all this about production numbers being reduced as my car is scheduled for week 30??"
"Looks like you better at negotiating than me, I've only got 4K of options and have paid 45K, also been given a build week of 30"
Do you know anything about production being affected which may delay delivery?
Thats for the US market.EU cars will still come from Germany.
"The sq5 seems to b holding well,the cheapest in the BIBLE (autotrader) is £39500 on a 13 reg,so for a car of nearly 2 years old that cost aprox 48k with that spec,it's looking good ????"
If you dont mind me asking when did you order. I have an order that i placed in may and have been told week 45 upto now
"I placed my order on 6th June, but dealer had a car with no owner that could still be modified, so that's what he did. I went with a view to looking at a used car..."
Yes same for me dealers order cars hoping they can sell/change the spec before the build date arrives. In my case their next car was BW 30 and I/they were able to change spec to suit my order.
"Incorrect the new plant in Mexico will be the global hub for Q5 production apparently hence as why it's seen as quite a risk. The investment itself is enormous, I'd liked to be proved wrong if you have info then share! I don't want a Mexican Q5 either!"
What's the maximum range that anyone has managed to get out of a full tank of fuel in the SQ5?Mines currently forecasting 625 miles after having done about 80 since last full fill up.So I'm looking for maximum DIS and maximum actual range achieved.
"Sorry, not an SQ5, but I achieved 683 miles on a tank (72 litres to fill) after a roadtrip from Bristol to the Northeast on my 2litre last year, and that included a week back at work doing the 5 mile each way commute in traffic.The week before last I had travelled 200 miles and the range remaining was 650, so a potential combined total of 850 miles. Based on last year's trip I think it might just about do that if all of it was on a long steady journey."
"I've had a 500 once,but that was all motorway ????"
Not SQ driver but experience of DIS over the years is that the range can look really impressive just after a fill and remain static despite doing 50+ miles but drops much quicker in the second half of the range. My 3.0 V6 TDI Allroad (80 litre tank) would often show a range of 850-900 miles just after filling up but rarely had the bravery to exceed 600 miles in reality when it would take pretty close to the full 80 litres. 2.7TDI before it similar but not quite so optimistic. 2.0 TFSI will indicate 475-485 after fill up and remain there for up to 80 miles implying a range of 550+ but usually chicken out and stop to fill up after around 480 miles when the range is 0 and put in 70 - 72 litres.
"I usually get 600 miles per tank, most I have ever managed is 620. I usually see 725 on the DIS but there is no way that is possible, I think 650 would be a push and probably not achievable."
"500 miles for ours as well, filled up on Saturday and the DIS showed 570 but we just don't seem to get far past 500"
Couldn't do the 650 odd miles from our place (Bucks) down to the Dordogne last year - filed up in Normandy after about 150 miles from home
2 tanks so far400 miles from eachI guess I need to have a word with my right foot.
Don't know if this has been mentioned but I just noticed that a 326ps competition version of the SQ5 is now being offered in Germany. (As they have done with the A6 and A7 bi-turbo I think in the recent past)Interestingly the headline performance returns0-100kmh 5.1s326PS @ 4000-4500 rpm650Nm @1400 - 2800 rpm174 g/kmin contrast to the 313PS0-100kmh 5.2s313PS @ 3700-4800 rpm650Nm @ 1400 - 2800 rpm174 g/kmIt only costs 600 euros more ! (at first glance)
Seems well worth the £ ????
"Yes ,I s'pose you would take it if you were ordering new now - I bet the difference is not noticeable though.I just don't get why they would they would bother for £450. Its not like the performance is any different really, and its not like it costs any more - maybe I am missing something ! Why not just sell the 326ps"
"Isnt it just the new updated MY16 engine, where all Q5 engines have changes from week 22?the 2.0l TDI going from 177 to 190ps for eg."
its 1550 euro extra......seems a lot for little extra power
Its not much of a difference tbh. It would be cheaper to get a DTUK box with more of a power difference. But if this had been available when I was ordering I probably would have taken it.
The 313PS engine in the standard SQ5 is Euro 6 compliant now with the Co2 down from 179 to 174!
"It has some unique alloy wheels from Audi Sport though only 20"" and in Matt Black"
"They lost my interest as soon as i saw the black pack, also not a fan of the wheels."
Just thought I would share I managed 47mpg (avg) on a 75 mile run from Brentford to Southampton this week. Had it in economy mode all the way and gentle with the pedal. Had a bit of queuing on the M25 and part of the M3 so wasn't a continuous constant speed all the way.Was quite impressed although the trip was bloody boring!!MT
"Brentford, my old stopping ground..."
This is impressive. Is yours a diesel?
"Yes, Euro SQ5s are Diesel, 313PS/650Nm - also bear in mind that we are on Imperial Gallons with 20 fluid ounces in each pint, the US Gallon has 16 fluid ounces I think?"

"Thx for clarifying about imperial gallons. You still did very well specially with the SQ5.We do not get the SQ5 in Diesel in the U.S. We are very happy with our std TDI, and imagine how much more powerful yours is.When convenient, can you share specs such as HP, Torque, etc? What % more did it cost over std TDI w/ Tech pkgWishing you well"
SQ5 TDi BiTurbo (Europe)0-100kmh 5.2s313PS @ 3700-4800 rpm650Nm @ 1400 - 2800 rpm174 g/km
My SQ5 displayed 51.3 mpg (avg) on Friday after 36 miles of motorway!
"All fanciful stuff, as Sq5john says, from the DIS. Real world consumption measured on full to full is nothing like this. Amusing to try and see how high one can get the average figure by keeping the right foot pressure down. Over 50 quite easy to show on a 3.0TDI but real world more like low to mid 30s, Petrols appear to be less fanciful in their readouts and closer to real world consumption going by both my Q5 and wife's Scirocco which is much more economical than either of my V6 TDI A6 quattros but rarely if ever indicates an average of > 50mpg. Some technically minded member may be able to explain why DIS can be so optimistic on diesels."
One would fondly imagine that Audi would have used some neat little fuel flow metering device to calculate fuel consumption alas that's not the case and the fuel economy is calculated from a data table: speed/gear/throttle position/air temp/AC etc.
I have been told today that my SQ5 has been built after a long six month wait. What timescale can I now expect from the factory to the dealer. Thanks for your advice.
"It's anything upto 4 weeks,"
4 Weeks !!!! what a joke it can`t take that long I could walk to Germany in 4 weeks.
"Mine took a week and a half, prepped and ready to go."
"Mine is being built right now, and it should be in my hands in 4 weeks!"
"I ordered mine in March and i am still waiting to hear if the build is finished, origional delivery date July, then told May now it looks like it will be July"
"It is not advertised, but there is an option to collect in Germany."
"My Q5 was started in the the factory on the 21st of May, left the factory on the 25th of May, arrived at the UK port on the 4th of June, arrived at the dealer's on Wednesday and is being delivered tomorrow. Hope that helps."
"By the way, I was told by Audi Customer Services a couple of weeks ago that they are beta-testing with 100 customers an iPhone app that lets you track your vehicle's progress from the first minute it's started in the factory, all the way through the steps in the factory, across the water and to the dealership (at which point they don't track its progress further). I don't know when it's due to be released, but I'd imagine in a few months there'll be no need for threads like this ;-)"
... unless you don't own an iphone.
Enjoy Andy
Have been told that car at stage 38 ?? and that it is at the docks in Germany....... Now I cant wait !! How long do you think it will take to get to the dealer.
I assume you are UK based. Should be 3 to 4 weeks. I have noticed that shipments to Grimsby and frequent but shipments to Sheerness are few an far between.
"Hello new here.We have just order an SQ5. Could some of you give me some info regarding the order process?We selected the car, options, etc. and paid the deposit. We was given the invoice for the deposit and the Vehicle Order Form from the dealers. When the business manager was filling his computer screens out i noticed October for the car to be ready and thought sounds about right. So how do i know when the dealer has actually placed the order with the Manufactures and how I can track its order process from in the queue to being built, delivered..Many thanks"
"Hi just another quick question. Once you have given your deposit to the dealer, how long after can you add/change the spec you wanted without it altering your given build week"
I'd say about a month (3 weeks if your lucky).
You can make changes right up to the point when your order is given aconfirmedbuild date. Your dealer should keep you appraised.
which is 4 weeks before your build date...
"Did anyone see / hear about thishttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-32967568The showroom is about 9 months old and the roof doubles as a car park, collapsed this afternoon and 10 cars dropped into the service area, no one hurt thankfully.Got a vested interest as our replacement SQ5 (9 months in the waiting for) is supposed to be at the dealers ready for delivery to me at some point this week, hopefully it wasn't on the roof"
"Just bought a new Q5 over the weekend. Deal process went late into the night, so the ""Delivery Cleanup"" wasn't performed, just bring the car back during the week. We got a basic orientation, looks like an entire owners manual package, and Audi Connect package with the SIM card. Floor mats are installed. The next morning I'm glancing over the car and manual, and there's no tool kit in the lower trunk by the spare, can't find a jack anywhere (this model has the inflatable spacesaver spare.) There also is noting inside the long narrow compartment in the rear liftgate. I'm assuming these items are part of the final delivery cleanup.My question is, what standard ""loose"" items should be included in a new car? So I can confirm we receive when we go for the cleanup.Thanks, RJ"
"The jack is stored behind a plastic flap at the rear of the spare wheel well, not immediately obvious when you look in the well. The compartment in the tailgate is for an emergency warning triangle but not sure if this is part of US spec, The equipment packages are quite different on US vehicles compared to UK cars.The concept of negotiating for hours is familiar but driving away in the car the same day is uncommon in the UK as he aforementioned prep including issue of a licence plate, (registration number) take time.Enjoy your new wheels."
"Thanks! I will look again. The US manual shows an entire tool kit (not sure if it showed jack in that kit, will look again). It is under the main rear floor then under the plastic tray that fits between the inflatable spare and inside of rear bumper. I also will check the manual on the warning triangle - I believe those are standard on US BMW's. Thanks again! RJ"
Thinking about placing an order for new SQ5 soon but unsure of colour. I do like Panther Black but have Lava Grey Q5 at present so wanted a lighter colour -for a change- is White sensible or is it about to die a death in the colour desirability league?Cheers
"It can't die a death if you like it.I have glacier white and wouldn't dream of changing it for any other.Nothing to do with being sensible, just go to a few dealerships, and see which colour you personally like."
Yes I understand may just go for Floret Silver any idea if this is a dark silver or light as have not seen any. Assume its the same silver as the rest of the Audi range? or maybe different for the SQ5?
"I like white q5s as there's not many around,also I think silver is making a come back ????"
"I was going to go for lava grey (that would be 3 in a row!) until I saw a Q7 in glacier white in the showroom and fell in love.I found lava grey impossible to keep clean for more than a few miles and every time I cleaned it I found new fine scratches which annoyed me.Glacier white I have found is a pretty good balance, when clean looks sexy, stays looking clean for at least a week and fine scratches hardly notice."
Yep I agree interestingly Lava Grey is no longer available for the SQ5. May go for White but unsure as on larger vehicles its sort of says look at me or am I just being paranoid?
"Yes paranoid,the q5 is quite a small SUV ,I don't think it's a look @ me motor,and elite 1s are few and far between,they look gr8 ????"
Lava Grey is still an option on SQ5 on configurator?Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App
Yes but I think my dealer said its no longer available.. doesn't matter much as I will be getting a different colour maybe the burnt orange but high cost option!!
Dare I suggest that white SOMETIMES is a more feminine colour!!
"Any thoughts on Aventurinorange Mica?? Not seen any SQ5's but a few small Audis look good but costs around £2,000 might be better speccing this instead of Panther Black and Pan roof??"
"Are you really going to be swayed by our personal colour preferences, if spending £50k, or choose the one you personally like?And does 'White' sound or look more feminine than 'Aventurinorange Mica' ?"
"Have Floret silver. It replaced the Ice Silver of my previous Q5. It's a tad 'bluer' if that makes sense, but seems a better match for the Off Road Alloys now. Pics on previous post:http://www.myaudiq5.com/index.php/topic/17345-switch-from-20tdi-to-30tdi/page__st__20"
Yep colour is very personal but hey isn't that what forums are for?
This might help you:https://www.carwow.co.uk/blog/Audi-Q5-2014-Colour-Guide
Thanks. My two choices for this car will be either Panther Black or Floret Silver. White is a distant third. Anyone gone for the Diamond Stitching seats at a £790 option and were you happy with the result?
Well i'd go for white over black...
So many to chose from! I saw a Volcano Red Q5 with Black Styling Package and Titanium wheels. The contrast/combination was fantastic.
Thinking about placing an order for new SQ5 soon but unsure of colour. I do like Panther Black but have Lava Grey Q5 at present so wanted a lighter colour -for a change- is White sensible or is it about to die a death in the colour desirability league?Cheers
"White def not girly,I think silver over black,black is the nuts wen clean ,but only stays clean 1 day,then the dust shows ,grey easiest to keep clean ,but you got that already,sounds like white is not 4 u, leaves silver which will b my next colour on the new MERC GLE COUPE,haven't had a silver car since 2004 ,the X5,or that new mica blue which is £1400 more than the £600 you gotta pay 4 metallic,I agree lose the pan roof and either get diamond stitch leather,or £2000 paint job Mica blue ,awesome colour ????"
"I have, took a risk as I never saw it in a car. Got confirmed build completion today so should be able to share thoughts soon once collected."
"Most of the SQ5s downunder are white, and would say it is the predominant colour for most cars. There is something about the light in Oz, which makes white cars pop. Plus our roads are significantly cleaner than those in the UK."
Rumour has it that the sun shines brightly in Oz which makes having a white car a sensible choice too....
"We get 3x the amount of rain compared to where I lived in East Anglia, but not complaining when it its winter next month, and still hitting 20 degrees, just"
"It's maybe all in my mind, but my car appears to have higher revs when idling than it used to have. Not that I can remember what the previous revs were, but the counter is now showing between 8 and 900 revs when stationery at junctions etc. Could you please let me know how that sits in comparison to your Q5s?Thanks a lot."
Sounds right to me.
"Yes, mine always on around 800 from memory, may alter a bit between start up and warmed up, will look exactly on my next drive out and let you know.Anyway, if it is considered too high, an Audi mechanic should be able to adjust it in less than a minute"
Thanks folks.
"Yep, checked it, sits on about 850 rpm at all times. I reckon yours is ok."
"Cheers Sj, my imagination put to rest."
"Hi All,Just specing up our new Q5 and have a question I hope you guys can help with as I cant find decent pictures out there to compare!We have gone for the S Line Plus 2.0 TSFI 225ps Tiptronic in Glacier White with 20"" titanium RS6 alloys.Now the question is....... Should I spec the Black Styling pack?TBH I had to battle with the Mrs to get the titanium wheels (it will be her car Mon - Fri, as I do a long commute), she thinks it will look too manly with the black, but I think it will just suit better... But cant find any decent pics to back up my theory.We have also added nearly £2k of extras... Advanced key, light pack, folding mirrors, bench seat etc etc... So cost is a consideration too.Thanks for any advice or pics!C"
"Glacier white looks great with chrome, I have it.If you google I'm sure you can find examples of each"
"Thanks SJ, I've looked and cant find decent pics of both exact combo's. Think we will stick with the chrome, particularly with the handles being chrome too.... (i think).... Shame there are so few about in the dealerships to make an informed decision before purchase."
"There's some on here..https://www.google.c...CCsQ7Ak&dpr=0.9specifically, exactly like yourshttp://www.asean-corporation.com/?cur=car/view&id=118&title=2013_Audi_Q5_2.0T_FSI_Quattro_S-Line_Plus_(225PS)"
"In my humble opinion ( I considered black pack when ordering mine) The black istooblack, especially in contrast with the titanium alloys, which are grey/black.It's chrome all the way for me"
Chrome for sure. it just looks wrong with the black.
"I think black pack suits on white better than any colour,especially with the dark wheels,or u could just get the front grill wrapped ????http://s1371.photobucket.com/user/dwaterman1/library/SQ5"
Without doubt go for chrome!
"Cheers all.SQ-BEAST - your SQ5 looks awesome with the black pack, if only I could have stretched that far.....Think I will stick with the chrome, particularly as we may need to add running boards for the kids in the future."
"Sorry Beast yeah I see now, new to the forum so didnt notice your sig The satin grey looks lovely mate, nice motor!!"
Thanx lads ????????????
"Sq beast your car looks great, which grey colour is your sq5?I too am thinking of upgrading my q5 preferably with the black style pack and titanium wheels but not sure on colour of the vehicle ie black, white or grey.Many thanks"
"Originally black from factory,but after it was a year old I got bored of black,so had it wrapped SATIN MATT GREY ,and all chrome wrapped GLOSS BLACK ????"
"After a bad day day last Friday had a new windscreen fitted, low flying pigeon flew straight into my line of vision and then bang.

I put my car into the dealers for some work and asked them to look into it and fix it. When I got it back it was in the same position and they said that is where Audi says it has to be. Not sure how true that is because I have an A6 and the passenger blade on that car sits right down under the bonnet line when its at rest with the VIN number shown above the blade. I asked the same question as you on here ages ago and didn't get much response on it."
Mine sits under the bonnet line.There is a park feature which I would use to facilitate adjustment.There are many pictures on this site showing what you have asked. Indeed one can see the correct park position in your own photo.
I had to remove both wiper arms and reseat them after windscreen replacement this year...
"I am sure mine was hidden before from the inside, and in my opinion it doesn't look quite right, going to move it today, noticed the wiper arm also gets beaten with insects in this current position too, it's worked hard this last two weeks, now on 6000 miles since delivery on March 26th.Thanks for all your posts"
mine rests just below the vin number
"MissileIs the park feature for the wipers only available on later cars, I have a 2009 and have looked in the handbook and cannot see any mention of parking the wiper blades (only the service position)Also I cannot seem to see any pic of Audistorm that shows the park feature position, unless I'm missing something!"
"Hi,I should have made my suggestion clearer.Look at wipers and decide > I want them to park circa 1inch higher / lower. Put them in the service position, where they are easier to access. Take off the blades and replace them 1inch higher / lower."
"OK, Got you. Its only the passenger side on mine that is resting above the VIN plate. Its catching my eye from the driving seat and annoying the hell out of me."
"Since last posting in this thread I've been taking notice of vehicles to see where their wipers sit when at rest, There are loads of vehicles with the passenger blade parked above the VIN number. It must just be personal preference as to where it sits as I've noticed it on different makes and models not just Q5's."
"I did, I walked through ASDA car park while waiting for the wife and looked at the other cars. Its amazing what you notice when you're actually taking notice of things and looking for something in particular."
"Hi all,My lovely Franz is now 22 months old, so I have ordered his replacement. The last 3 cars I have had have been white, so I wanted to break out of the mould that I seem to have made for myself.

I have searched on here, but can't find any. As usual, your help is most appreciated.J"

Many thanks!
"Hi Guys,The car is on variable servicing and not due for quite sometime however its coming up to 1 year old next month and I do lots of short trips (only covered about 5.5k miles so far) so was thinking to be sensible and go with yearly servicing.What's the average people have been paying for their first service on the SQ5?Cheers,MT"
"Ask your local dealer, he should provide a fixed price quote. My dealer gave a very competitive price, but I doubt you want to travel to Aberdeen <LOL>"
"When I took mine in for first oil change, after a year and 9,500 miles, the service manager basically said I wasting my time, and told me to come back closer to 19,000 miles for a first service & oil change together."
Can someone please briefly explain the two types of servicing available (variable etc)?
"I think I paid £360 for the 2 combined @13k miles,next now due 30k ????"
I'm a fan of straight forward annual services
https://www.audi.co.uk/owners-area/servicing-maintenance-mot/servicing-your-audi.html
Thanks - Based on that I will be on the 'Flexible service schedule' then.
"The question is ""how long will you keep the car"". If 3-4 years then go for the variable servicing at about 19,000 miles or 2 years. If longer, you will want the best reliability, so go for the 12 months or 10k miles whichever is sooner."
"Roughly speaking the 1st service @ around 18,000 miles will be circa £300 and the next at 36,000 will be a £700 and will include a brake fluid change and an air filter."
"I've never managed that, the rule of thumb I use is 15kHigh milers will, but I run out of time not miles.."
Just paid £309 at 17000 miles. Had a quote from Cheshire Oaks Audi of £390 so it pays to shop around.
"Any amateur detailers recommend a scratch removal product, had my drivers side wing mirror caught by the wing mirror of a HGV on a narrow country lane this morning and its left a black mark on the IBIS white paint. There's no scratches so hopefully its just paint transference.Meguiars ScratchX 2.0 seems to get good reviews but open to suggestions on anything else.Cheers!"
"There are several layers involved1. Paint from other vehicle2. Clear Laquer Coat3. Base or colour coat4 Primer5 Whoops! I've gone too far coatSounds like No 1. Just a gentle compound, like Goddards silver polish ( very fine jewellers rouge) or a mild cutting compound with polish mixed should do. Be gentle though."
Definitely not 5! Was just a gentle kiss of the wing mirrors - not enough to knock it back in even.Will try the Goddards stuff they sell it at Tescos so can pick some up on the way home.
T cut ?
"clay bar would be my first step, failing that you will need a cutting compound"
"Just got back from France with mine and need my drivers door redoing. Car park in the hotel was half full, of all the places some twat parks its next to me and somehow left two scratches right in the centre of the door. I'm livid! Lucky for them they had already gone otherwise theirs would have had more than a scratch!MT"
None of those if its just a mark on top of you paint - Just use a slightly abrasive polish like Autoglym and spend some time on getting it off.
"Chopper, if you are in Edinburgh or Uddingston, I will fix it for you.PM me"
"Did you mean "" Some Person"""
Megs Scratch X sounds like your weapon of choice. There will be fine scratches on your paint if there was contact. Use the Megs until it looks pretty perfect and then Autoglym Super Resin to perfect the finish.
No it was definitely a twat!MT
So why did he get the right car?
Just T Cut - Works wonders. I had a Transit van clip my mirror - I say clip - he nearly broke it off!! The glass came loose and was dangling on wires and the coded plastic separated from the base. After re-assembly T-cut removed the black plastic scrapes from the cowling a treat!

No there is not unfortunately ????
"I know that switch opens it, but I thought there was some trick to using the same thing to close it (but I can't remember where). Something about using that switch but the ignition has to be running and the driver's seatbelt plugged in (or some other strange combination)."
AFIK the switch only opens the door. I read the reason it could not be closed remotely was to avoid someone / something being trapped as the door closed.
There is a mod I saw somewhere that allows you to close it with the keyfob or doorbuttonI think it was on here
I would really like to be able to close it as well as open it remotely.
"Me too, where would that mod be??"

You can adjust the height of where the tail gate opens to if that helps?

Fuel consumption has been discussed by several SQ5 owners. I get 30 mpg.Doing 8K the difference in fuel cost per year between 30 and 37.2 mpg is £319.45 at my local garage. I would suggest it is not worth worrying over.
30 is more than I was expecting but 20-22 would be too low for my liking even with low mileage. Thanks for your quick reply missile.
"Hi naq5, I did a similar run on a test drive over around 15-20 miles, and given that the boring bit of a test drive was over very quickly ( ie pootling around to see how refined it was and how it rides over average roads), I spent the rest of the time hoofing it in dynamic mode to leave a couple of VW R32's for dead, hard acceleration through tight bends and roundabout etc etc, I ended up at 23 mpg which I thought was respectable. It was on better than I'd expect in my current 535d M Sport.... I'd say 40+mpg would be a nice bonus..and fully agree with missile... I'd pay that - good smile per £ ratio...."
I'm getting similar to ZED per tank - and also the long vs short/cold trips. My commute is only 4 miles so am getting below 20 for that each day - but on longer runs even including a bit of hoofing as Budda put it am getting mid 30's - and could easily achieve high 30's to 40 if I really wanted to.
You diesel boys are all leadfoots. I'm getting 32mpg on longer runs on M way and a combined average of close to 29 mpg which includes a lot of short runs from my TFSI. If you are doing mostly short runs I don't think you'd notice a huge difference. OK you'd miss the extra 80 BHP the SQ5 delivers. Lets face if you've got between £35k and £50k to splash on a new car fuel consumption is not really going to be uppermost in your mind is it?
"You are spot on, my Timberland boots are expensive on fuel. As a compaison I struggled to average 25mpg in my old 2.0 TFSI. I am too embarassed to say what my fuel comsumption was like when I owned my SP1.http://s183.photobucket.com/user/missilebob/media/MOVDonnington_zpscf252a53.mp4.html"
Thanks very much for all your replies gents. I know querying fuel consumption on a 300+ bhp £50k 4x4 is a little silly but I just wanted to go into it with my eyes open. All very helpful so thanks for all your input.
Dont you just hate it when all someone does is ask about MPG and other people just attack them for it suggesting they should go for a cheaper vehicle...This happens on other forums too. What's the harm in finding out the facts before making a big purchase???
"Not silly at all. I think there is always the reality that the quoted MPG is always higher than real world as well. The worst car I ever had was a Range Rover. Very early previous generation and it used to really frustrate me when I got 12mpg. I knew it would be expensive but not that bad. You could ask a few of the current Evoque owners how they're feeling about MPG at the moment...a mate has one and it is so bad he's getting rid of it after 5 months.Having said all of that, I really don't care personally anymore...no matter the MPG, the cost of tyres and services etc, it's all about the fun!"
I dont think it is at all but certainly there are plenty who carry on along the lines of if you can afford 50k why would you care..... but if you could afford 50k chances are you didn't get in that position by careless either. One of the big attractions of the SQ5 is its economy so i am glad you started the thread.Cheersmondie

Not at all silly. If I had asked this question on the Evoque forum I would have saved all the problems getting rid of a vehicle that was delivery over 10mpg less than land rover publish.Keep asking these very relevant questions they help many.
"I don't see anyone attacking OP, or telling him to go for cheaper vehicle. This is a well moderated friendly forum when compared to some others."
"For the record - MPG was one of my primary reasons for choosing the SQ5... My previous car cost a similar amount but was a petrol 3L turbo and guzzled gas (plus had 50% less torque!). It wasn't so much that I couldn't afford to run it, but seemed silly to pass up the chance to have the same performance and also get double the mileage at the same time."
I agree. Mines for the wife as a family wagon. I wanted the mpg as well as a bit of performance for when I drive it. S4 drinks fuel for fun. This is similar performance and about 10mpg more so a win win really!It's never going to be a 50mpg mega efficient run around though is it.
"LOL - no, defo not a super efficient runabout (thats what the Mrs' Mini is for!) - but I reckon about 30mpg is realistic long term - which is a lot better than my 17mpg average from my last car!"
Well I have a 26mpg TT and a 30mpg family run around... Didn't think this through lol
Haha I'd say I am...
Nobody is attacking anybody. Take a look at the running costs and residuals post helpfully posted by Shenstone.
"I would hope that we'll get 30-32 mpg average, after all the 8 speed auto and stop start should help, 10 years ago we were getting 31 mpg from a 330d M Sport Touring with only 204 bhp and a 5 speed auto box"
Saw 45.4 on the DIS for about and hour today doing in heavy traffic on the north side of M25 - was in Efficiency mode.I thought Efficiency (E) mode was the same as D - but it isn't - the transmission changes up as soon as its selected.
So what is D the equivalent of?
JonathanBR...if it's not too late respectfully suggest you consider adding Drive Select for the reasons indicated above...
Interesting. Having only D and S I was obviously interested in the ADS equivalents. Unfortunately the wife doesn't like me driving it in S all the time lol
That's amazing actually!
"Hi SQ5john, unfortunately too late to add Drve Select as our car is built waiting to ship, have Mini Cooper S with sport mode which changes throttle response, weight of steering etc and know that wife would never change settings so why bother.I guess we've suffered slightly from ordering before the full facts are out, if it had been possible to order suspension damping with DS I probably would have done.Only a couple of weeks to wait now"
Oh drat - I'm sure there will be a work around or Kufatech will have a solution before long.
"Agreed. Although like many I doubt I'd switch around much, to enable the exhaust permanently would be ideal."
"Hi All yes after having a demo SQ5 over the last two days with a good variation of driving with plenty of fast overtakes ! i have covered just under 400 miles, my average after resetting when collecting the car was 32.6 MPG i was quite impressed with that,"
Was that 46mpg on the DIS or calculated yourself?
"That's good going john hope that's what it ends up , steady driving part of the day today in my demo I've seen over 40 average on mpg dis, love the car can't wait ."
Oh Merlin - must have been hard to hand the car back? This is my 1st Q5 and the car is just so easy to live with on a day to day basis. Of the 800 miles I've done in the last 10 days two of the trips have been 250 miles+ each this is the 1st car I've had since a couple of Saab 95 Aero's 10 years ago that just effortlessly eat the miles with zero driver fatigue.
"It was hard to hand back- i'm thinking of heading back today to try and sneak out keys !!, Sounds like your very happy i have had two 3.0 tdi i think they are great cars ,after driving the SQ5 this weekend it really is world ahead with engine and gearbox- i love it.i take it the thoughts of your Evoque experience are long gone now and never coming back !!, enjoy the rest of your week endAll the best Merlin"
"I really don't know how you guys manage to achieve 40mpg. I guess you are all better drivers than I, but hey ho is this a face of worry?"
I'm sure you are an excellent driver missile - I got decent mileage because I was doing M40/M25/M1 during the day when it was all moving a combination of heavy traffic and lots of 50mph roadworks does wonders for fuel economy.
"that was on the display; would that differ so much from reality?anyhow, the way I was driving was unrealistic (about 10 mph faster than the trucks)Also, I did a lot of manual shifting, going faster to 8th gearMy average consumption with normal driving is about 35 mpg"
Audi DIS fuel economy calculations are traditionally hopelessly optimistic RobinT - it's derived from a data table with bunch of variables (like gear/driving mode/throttle position/time etc). I calculate my fuel consumption manually by brimming the tank at every fill up and then dividing the litres by 4.54 to get back to imp gallons and then dividing that into the miles travelled.
My first Q5 was 3.9% optimistic and the current one is working out at 3.2% optimistic on six fill-ups.
Thanks for explaning; I'll try again... someday when I feel like torturing myself again...
"Wilf,Interesting figures on the economy of the SQ5, surprises me the SQ5 uses more than the Toureg. Can I ask how you like the SQ5 vs. 4.2TDi Toureg? The V8 Toureg is an option we are weighing up against the SQ5 as we are not convinced the SQ5 is big enough for us.CheersSimon"
Hi Simon the SQ5 and the V8tdi are chalk and cheese. What I will say here on the forum is that the economy of the S should and will improve and that both the Touareg and the SQ were/are only pottering around each day ie most days only 8 miles which had/has an effect on mpg. I will pm you a bit later with info that i think you need for considering each motor and maybe some info that will help you get a bargain if its the Touareg route you go.
"Thanks for the PM Andy, just replied.CheersSimon"
Wilf only just read this thread assume brim to brim means 75 ltr if you divide 75 by 4.54 gives you a faction over 16 and a half gallons590 miles covered divided by 16.5 gives 35.7 miles per gallon or I'm I doing my sums wrong.
"Brim to brim is not brim to empty. He did not confirm he did all of those 590 miles during his test, or how much fuel he put in to brim the tank to full."
"I did a 1000 miles last week, and saw the DIS display 49.5 (tells big pokies) for an hour or so in steady traffic on the M6 - brimmed tanks was 37.88mpg over the week. Remarkable give the performance available."
"Thanks for that missile, should have read Wilfs note properly his 590 miles is what he's SQ as done so far isn't it.Silly me.Do love the colour of your car. I just wasn't brave enough to order it."
"I'm getting an average of 200 miles out of Â£50 wich is approx 25 to the gallon,I'm mostly round town,but do tend to boot it,from all audis I've had I've generally got 10 mpg less than what any acclaimed figures have said,the manufactures figures are based on,1 man driving @ 55mpg,with 1 gallon of fuel ,with no wind resistance ,clearly these conditions are never gona happen,lol,but I find the sq5 excellent performance and more than reasonable mpg 4 that much funí ½í¸"
"That's a fair comment daza as you say I just fill up when it's needed and enjoy the fun, great car great fuel economy end of !!"
"How are the SQ5 owners getting on with mpg now the weather has turned a bit colder? Jose, I'm assuming you'd notice it a bit with your short journeys?"
25mpg....Got heavy feet?
"Yes, colder weather has made a marked difference as it never warms up on my short runs. Getting 23mpg most mornings, was getting almost 30 in the summer. I'm running my heated seat constantly and often the rear demister as well so they won't help either. Managed 37mpg on a 130 mile run this eve and that included driving like a spanner for the last 20 miles (fun roads for the last bit to my house...)Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
"I'm still averaging 24.7, still under 1k miles though"
I saw 40.7 mpg on my DIS for the first time. I was embarrassed............ to be driving like a OAP.
I've hit the heady heights of 24.9!
"After 3 days of ownership I'm getting 19mpg...Should take off those lead boots, but I'm having too much fun..."
19mpg - ouch! Assume that's 'spirited' city driving?
"I've bumped it up to 25.2, Wahey!"
"So, I have now owned the SQ for a week and have stuck just under 600 miles on the clock - looked at the MPG this morning and it is standing at 31.3mpg. Very impressed!"
"It's now at 23mpg, as I've taken it off dynamic and set up my individual drive select... I love the way the car drives on comfort gearbox, very smooth but still plenty of power..."
"Couldn't agree more mate. Now, i know this will be controversial......but I stuck it in 'E' yesterday, and was actually surprised. For pounding some miles during awful weather, was actually a good use. What a great car!"
"I've not done many motorway miles yet, but does the 'exhaust' noise get annoying after a while? (I love it round town) or do you turn the b&o up so loud you can't hear it...??"
You can only hear the exhaust when you give it beans or at low speed - on the motorway you sit at 2k rpm and the exhaust noise is drowned out by road noise or even the slightest bit of radio. It's not droney like a Scuby!
Agree - the sound of the exhaust is awesome. The only reason I used E yesterday was I didn't need all the power of S as the road conditions were awful. I was happy at 70 in E yesterday and my priority was getting home safely.
"As for the exhaust on the motorway in E, you can't hear it at all. I have the 21"" wheels and they do generate a bit of noise in the cabin. But as Josè mentioned, It is not Droney."
Haha! Have fun!
"The SQ will return pretty good fuel economy, ideally on a motorway at a constant speed, heavy traffic on the M1 at a steady 50 will routinely see north of 40mpg easily on the DIS. Regular trips down the M40 for me see 39mpg on the DIS and 36/37mph actual back at the pumps. Pretty remarkable given the performance available..."
"Does the Auto mode adapt to how you are driving, is that its purpose? I haven't got my car yet and having sold my X5 I'm needing to fill my head with SQ5 thoughts and plans. I went for Audi Drive Select but not the dynamic steering."
"Yes, depending on your inputs it adapts the shifts etc. It's very subtle, you don't notice it has suddenly got sporty or got comfortable...It's basically a middle ground between the two dynamic/comfort modes that goes slightly towards either end of the scale depending on what you are doing.The only way I can notice anything is if you spank it for a few miles, and then suddenly decide to accelerate gently it will hold the gears longer than usual.Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
Wow very impressive!
I have creaped up slightly to 32.0......
I'm only getting 34 in my 2.0. If I get anywhere near 32 when my SQ arrives then I'll be delighted!
Lots of city driving...29mpg; still not awful considering!
I prefer my own spreadsheets so I can monitor trends and other such nerdy things.
You can export/import your data on the site - it's a handy place to keep your data and share with others.Plus it has a list as long as my are of custom stats you can produce etc. I'd be surprised if you are doing things in your spreadsheets the site can't.

Can't get near that in my 2.OL !!!
"Good work, and all in reverse? ;-)"
Don't think much of your choice of musak
"Blimey over 50 mpg is impressive, the only time I've ever reached that was in a Golf GTD. Was that stuck at 56 mph on cruise for the entire 107.9 miles? Oh and are you using normal diesel or the more expensive variety?"
"Was that down hill,no revs lol í ½í¸"
"I've not done a proper check on a full tank yet, novelty of the loud pedal hasn't gone away, but I do get around 37 on the DIS on my early motorway commute of 20 miles plus about 5 miles normal roads. Looking forward to playing the 'how high will it go' game when I can be a bit more disciplined.Those are certainly very good figures that you have achieved"
"Sounds good naq5. I usually take the combined mpg and take off 20% and that is what I end up getting overall. Therefore on the SQ5 I am expecting about 33mpg but from yours and other posts I have read I may be able to get high 30's which would be great, especially as I do mainly motorway and dual carriageway miles. I guess the 8th gear helps!Sent fromAutoGuide.com Free App"
I would think 8th gear helps for economy certainly and maybe efficiency mode helps too although I've given up on it as it makes the car feel too sluggish. Stop start also gets turned off as soon as I get in the car so those figures could possibly be improved a little. Happy with the consumption considering I use Dynamic almost all of the time and now I've mostly given up on a run-in enjoy the performance where possible.
"I filed up this week@Â£90 ,and am driving in efficientcy for 95%,so I'll c how my figures turn out,I've. Been averaging 26 ish,but I'm in dynamic most of the time í ½í¸"
"I'm now averaging 29 mpg 8 months later,mpg calculated from real time Maths not the DIS"
6 months on and 13k miles and I am on 36.2 according to the dis but it's really more like 33mpg. I am happy with that though.
"Be careful re the data from the DIS, in my experience tuning boxes play with the common rail sensor and fool it into changing fuel pressures to increase power, hence they can make the engine readings go haywire, only a remap seems to give you accurate mpg data. Do a tank to tank miles against physical fuel used for clarification."
"I get you.As a guide I was seeing 45mpg pre tuning and doing approx. 585 miles to a tank, I see 610 miles on average to a tank now,"
"Even driving like Miss Daisy I find it very hard to believe you regularly achieved 45mpg. Audi claim 37, 44 and 41 mpg for urban, extra urban and combined."
"High 20s with a lot of urban driving, low 40s on a decent run without hanging about."
"Its because I do 40/50 miles on a typical run, mainly motorway, so that's how I achieve high MPG.The 45mpg is quoted on DIS. Based on tank capacity and miles per tank it averages at 38mpg in real terms.What is obvious is that the DIS is not accurate if stock or with a tuning box."
"Ultra impressive stats there,I've tried the driving like mis daisy,doesn't seem to make that much diff ,and extremely boreing ,I'm just happy with the average near 30s with my heavy foot"
"When driving on the motorway with cruise control, I find that there is a significant difference in MPG when Drive Select is set to Economy compared with Dynamic. Even though it's constant speed, constant revs in the same gear (8).The difference could be up to 10 MPG.Can someone explain the reason for the difference?"
"Done over 10000 miles now and DIS is reporting 35mpg, actual mpg measured between fill ups is 32. Nearly all journeys done on A roads with plenty of overtakes. Previous 170bhp 2.0 tdi averaged 36 mpg over 50000 miles. So for the extra power and fun available in the SQ I'm very happy with the 'economy'."
mine does 32 mpg around the doors and 40+ on motorway at 70mph
I've now done 6k miles. Averaged 31.4 mpg since new. Just tried a whole tank on efficiency mode and got 34 mpg. Was it worth it? NO!
"Totally agree ,the difference is not worth the boredom"
Paid 118.9p for diesel day so its looking even better.
"They've ripped us off 4 so long it seems cheap now,it should b £1.15p according to the news"
"Fuel economy has taken a bit of a hit with the cold weather. Down from 30ish to 25ish (all urban 8 miles each way in rush hour). Might also have something to do with heavier traffic the last month or so caused by road works meaning being sat in stationary traffic for longer. Wouldn't normally be an issue if I used stop start but mine has developed a fault with stop start so it's now permanently disengaged until I can get it into the dealership to get fixed. Agree about efficiency mode, barely makes any difference other than making the car feel lethargic and slow so I leave it in dynamic most of the time."
"Late reply to old post ,Im Sure SM u have hooligan days in ur R8,it's the best looking hooligan out there ????????"

"just did my first decent run in my SQ5 with around 1400 miles on the clock from Stonehaven up to Inverness and back up through the grampian mountains over the Lecht ski resort, so lots of small B mountain roads with the last stretch on the infamous A9 so for 20 miles or so at 60 ish.Returned 34 MPG average, i ran a 2013 Q5 3.0 diesel previously on the same runs last year achieving around 36-37 MPG so cannot complain one bit, the torque delivery on these montain roads is awsome."
"Newark to Milton Keynes n back yesterday averaged 36mpg more than happy, didn't hang around."

Surely u must b Hopi with late 30's out of a 3litre ????
Very happy with late 30s. Just comparing to the alleged 50+ mpg on relatively short journeys. My journeys are invariably 200 miles each way and I struggle to get better than 38mpg. Most of which is on the M1 which has 40 odd miles of 50mph average speed cameras from the end of the M18 to J28 and 20 odd miles further south at Northampton. I think my Wife's Bluemotion 2.0tdi Passat Estate would just scrape 53 mpg!!!

Do I imagine this?I have just started saving music onto SD cards instead of playing from my iPod. The sound quality seems dramatically improved. Does anyone have a logical explanation or is it just my imagination?
Not your imagination at all Dave - I think by default that itunes will compress your music to 128 kbps when it saves it to your ipod were as you may well be saving music to your SD card at a far higher bit rate and the difference in quality is dramatic. I've started to use 320 kbps MP3's all of the time now as the file size is still realistic and the quality is very good.Kev
Thanks Guys.I was just 'dragging and dropping' from iTunes onto SDHC card. I use the Interface cable in the Glove box.My iTunes was still on the default settings but I have now re-configured to use 320kbps mp3's.Can't wait to give it a blast.Thank's for the input.
"Hi,where are the settings in i-tunes?Rich"
"CarbonCopy said:All a bit subjective to be fair. Doesn't have to be mp3 compression but I can certainly tell the difference between 128 and the higher bit rates. VBR worth a try too.Storage is so inexpensive now that I don't think you have to compromise as much. I rip everything to lossless or download at 320 kbps (from Play generally), then you have the option of doing what you will with it. There's no going back once you compress a track and I use the higher quality tracks when streaming through my domestic gear, which is a lot less forgiving than an ipod ever will be, and I believe that to a certain extent the same is true of the B&O. Horses for courses!I started out using my ipod Touch in the car but for my money the B&O is far more capable than the ipod - and I would expect that it would be. I now use a couple of SD cards, a pen drive and the Jukebox - well pleased with the resultsClick to expand...All makes sense to me Kev,It's no use having a high end music system to decode your music files if you encode them at low quality."
"Hi Rich,If you go to:Itunes>Preferences> General>import settings."
Good point by JW_Q5 about just copying the files from itunes and the bitrate being exactly the same - I keep mine at 128 in itunes so I don't fill the pod up too quickly and use 320 for the car. I did think about having a mess with Apples 256 VBRDave - be good to know if you think there is any improvement with higher bit rates?
SD does sound better with the default setting and no itunes to fight with - its a win win.
"Excellent guide, Rob!I was reading a manual yesterday and was unpleasantly surprised by the 4000 files limit per media..."

"I have not done that mileage on my SQ5.However on my previous Q5 which I sold at 4 years old, all that I spent was: 2 X service + two tyres + MOT, at a fraction of £129/month = £6,192.More importantly, I would rather pay as you go and have the freedom to replace tyres at my discretion, i.e. the make of my choosing and not when they reach the wear indicator. Similarly I may wish to change pads and disks before they reach Audi minimum tolerance."
"Missile is so rite ,with a rough calc 1st service around £350, 2nd main service worse case £600 ,brake pads £200,tyres 20"" £700 ,21"" £850, so your £129 a month is a massive over spend ,I'd cancel and pay as u go ????"
You might want to check your contract for any cancellation charges.
Thanks I think they just said 28 days notice when I spoke to them but will check the contract first.
"Hi downside of re directing a dealer optioned Q5 to ourselves and not into the demo fleet was that the darkened B pillar back windows were not available. While we investigate after market tinting does anyone have knowledge on suppliers of sun screens that would fit into the tailgate window and keep the sun off our black labrador when we are driving. I have noticed audi sells some for A6 (not sure if avant or saloon)and A3 also noticed VW sells a roll up/down screen for some of its models. If anyone has inside information that the Q5 rear window is the same as a VW/Skoda/seat XX model I could investigate those avenues. Failing that, if an approved item is not available has anyone come across a Halfords generic type sun shade that could act as a temporary fix.Many thanksJean"
Resurrected as I'm interested in this too (although I do have tinted windows). I've seen a 2 piece and 3 piece set offered by Audi as accessories but I've never been able to ascertain whether it was just for the rear doors or it included the rear tailgate or not. Anyone aware?
These any good??http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B004DJ45RI/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1420658140&sr=8-2&pi=AC_SX200_QL40&dpPl=1&dpID=41zp68AGIuL&ref=plSrch
"Thanks for the link. The Sonniboy made ones come as a full set. I think I've now narrowed Audi's products down to a 2-piece blind set (for the rear side windows) and a 3-piece blind set (small rear side windows and tail-gate). Audi's 3-piece set comes in at around £150. I can't find the tail-gate blind on it's own though, which is what I was thinking of. These are interior clip-in full window meshes. Interesting Euro prices - EU145 incl tax for the Audi 3-piece set is around £116 so something's got lost in the currency conversion!"
Found these (although the tailgate blind is split for easy storage). Much cheaper though:http://www.blinds4ca...Sun-Blinds.html
"shenstone1936 said:Update: Despite my local Audi dealer telling me that there's no leeway on the £150 for the 3-piece rear blind set, I looked on eBay and there's an Audi dealer (Hitchen Audi) from the same parent company (Jardine) whose parts dept sell genuine Audi items, some of which accept bids. To start with it was advertised at £135 (already a £15 saving) so I bid £100. They came back with £120 incl post, which I accepted. They arrived today (a day later). Don't get me wrong, these items are not worth more than £50 if I'm honest, but I really wanted that rear bind! So I have mesh blinds that just slot into place. I have covered the small rear load bay windows and that all important rear window. I already have tinted windows, and it just looks like the rear windows are a little more tinted. The advantage is that at anytime I can just spring them out. They are offering more at £135 (but will again take bids) if anyone is interested:http://www.ebay.co.u...-/161578811067?Click to expand...which one did u end up purchasing? im also in the market for rear sunscreen."
"Speaking to my dealer today about my Q5 delivery on June 1st and he informed me ""I'm lucky"" as all Audi dealers have just been informed of a fire at an Audi supplier meaning a lack door handles ! Most Audi models will have delivery delayed six weeks. This effects all European deliveries"
Great... Awaiting confirmation from my dealer to see if this affects me. Anyone have any further info?
"The desktop document published yesterday explains that deliveries of A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, Q5 and new R8 may be delayed.Cars affected are those which have confirmed BW 16,17,18 and they go on to say that some later BW's may be affected as well.A fire in a factory of a supplier of door handles is to blame.They say that the interruption may delay deliveries by up to six weeks."
"""Hi Andy, unfortunately it is true and it will affect some orders, but our Factory are working hard to resolve the issue asap."" (from Audi UK's Customer Care Twitter account)"
"I've had Audi Customer Services confirm that my car (being built next week) shouldn't be affected and the dealer has confirmed the same, so hopefully yours is already pretty much built! Good luck!"
You're welcome. This week is Build Week 20 by the way (in case you didn't know that and I'm not 100% sure that was clear/stated by me).
"Had confirmation from my Audi dealer today - SQ5 has been built and its on the way to the ship, will be here in 3 weeks! ...and it has door handles!"
"All depends on the model, i have a car on order and its not been delayed.It was due to be built next week, but was built yesterday."
they could adopt the old british Leyland and fit 4 different handles!!!only joking
I would take mine with just one on the drivers door if it meant they would hurry up a bit...
"Are the 21'' wheels available as an option for the SQ5 necessary as they are at £1,250 option and my current Q5 S-Line has 20's and it looks fine to me also the 21's are diamond cut so if you scuff them its difficult to match the finish when getting refurbished as happened to me when I had a VW Tiguan."
"Yes def personal choice,the tyres for 21"" were over £300 a piece a year ago ,but now you can get for around £220 ,they do seem to wear quick,but we didn't bye the SQ expecting FORD running costs ,21's all the way ????"
Just searched the InterWeb and theres many horror stories about Diamond Cut wheels and the problems encoutered when trying to repair etc.. Its a pity that Audi don't offer a powder coated 21''er or painted as with the Q5 spec. Maybe on their 2016 models which I assume will be available from Oct 16?
"Theres got to b @least 20 members on here with 21""s and I've only read of 2 members needing refurbished wheels,it's bout £150 for a proper job per wheel,which isn't to bad considering each wheel is nearly a grand ,and you very rarely kerb 2 wheels together ????"
I think because Diamond cut wheels have only a lacquered finish it doesn't take much for water/salt to penetrate following stone chips etc.. and before too long you see corrosion developing and therefore will not last as long as their Powder coated cousins.IMO
"If you take your car to a car wash dont let them put the wheel cleaner solution on diamond cut alloys. If they say its fine/mild, ask them to put their bare hand it in first. This is a tip I got from someone I know that used to run a car wash business.I currently have diamond cut alloys (not a Q5) and only potential problem I see is the odd stone chip and cost of tyres."
Take the standard 20's fit winter tyres and fit 22's!http://fourtitude.com/news/aftermarket_tuner_news/audi-q5-update-from-caractere/
Another problem is that after 3 years the car with 21'' wheels will not be worth anymore than a 20'' model....
"But the car with 21s will b more desirable ,thus making a quicker sale ????"
I suppose that depends on what condition the 21s are in...........LOL
"The cost of new 21""s would put me off."
Even the dealer said if its too badly damaged you will need a new wheel which will probably not be the case with 20's. I wonder if the MY 2016 cars will have a powder coated 21'' choice as I think there will be some changes come build week 25??
You also might go for 21s and not damage them!! Win win then for sure as they differentiate the SQ5 nicely.
That's all very well but when you damage them the wheel has to be taken off so your car is off the road for 1/2 days and stone chips are virtually unavoidable and if these wheels are not repaired water gets behind the lacquer and that's when the rot sets in but I understand they do look good!!
"I guess it depends how long your keeping your car 4 as mine are 20 months old and have no chips in laqor,or dents or scratches or kerbing,which would suggest the finish is of good quality ,so hopefully when mines 3 year old and I sell it the wheels are still mint ????"
"I concur, not a mark on my 21s either, after just over a year."
Anyone got it and can comment on how well it works?
"Yeah, and its ok - its one of those things you don't notice after a while."
"I find it is not perfect, often it will dip when approaching a corner if lights reflect off reflective chevrons - just what you don't want!"
Thanks guys - I think I will give it a miss then.
Its not perfect but I specced it and would do again. 95% of the time its excellent and very convenient.
"I haven't got ,and wish I did for the measly £65 they want. £ well spent,as the current lights I think are crap for there range/distance ????"
I changed my mind and specced it. List is £110 rather than £65 but I got a good deal on it.
I specced it too. Mainly because it didnt cost that much and I've not had it on previous.

Hi allCan anyone on this forum look up where my new q5 is in the build process as nit getting very much from my dealer?I got a copy of the order to audi. It stating status code 10 with a they build week on 22' which is end of May. I thought if it is to go ahead week 22 is should now have moved yo status 20 unless it has changed. But can't get dealer to confirmI have the order number if someone canThanks
Welcome aboard ????
Thanks sq Beast! Just waiting for my q5 now!
"10 just means its got a build date.No, we cant check for you - you need your dealer to do this."
Check with the dealer today and no change. Still Status 10 with theo build week 22. How long before that week will they firm it up and go to 20 or move the date?
It will goto 20 4 weeks before production.Updates to the status are on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
"Great thanks master, so it won't be week 22 then considering week 22 is in 3 weeks?? Shouldn't they have moved the they date then?"
Just been told my order has gone to status 20! Have gone back to dealer to ask but the bw is as all he told me is that it has gone to 20!
"Hi, Was deliberating over whether to swop my Q5 for SQ5 but unless I get a massive discount probably wont bother. However this got me thinking whether it might be sensible to hold on for the new Q5 which apparently hits the dealerships mid 2016 so may check out whether they are taking deposits at the moment and would appreciate some info from anyone that has already gone down this road. I know comparing the Q5 and SQ5 is pointless but I do like the Q5 and assume the new one will be better even in 2.0 TDI guise but maybe, just maybe I will still go for the SQ5 albeit to be replaced sometime in 2017 as my heart may get the last word!!Cheers"
"Order book is not open, you ""could"" ask for a top drawer order, but its just a holding deposit and you have no guarantee of a car first..So, why bother?"
Think the actual next generation Q5 arrives mid 2016 as for the current SQ5 DriveTheDeal are doing around 11.5% discount on my spec.
"If that ""arrives"" means ""taking orders"" then expect a 6-8 month wait before taking delivery based on the last facelift upgrade."
"May just go for the SQ5 as a straight buy as considered leasing but for PCP works out to around £23,000 over 36 months (£4,600 initial deposit plus £510 a month x 36 plus any other add-on's setting up). Like to think that if I can get around 13% discount which will take purchase price down to around £45,000 -for my spec- would hope that after 3 years MY car will be worth more than £22,000. I realise there's a missed opportunity to invest the money and get around 2% PA but that would only add around £3,000 making total car would need to be worth £25,000 after 3 years. Surely this will be achievable?"
"I think you may have a mistake in your math.lease or PCP, your monthly will be around the same.. interest on the deposit over 3 years is less than £300If you bought the car for 45k, the amount of interest lost if you work it out the simple way is around £2700, if you work it our based on paying back yourself @ 1250/month (or 1/36th) then the lost compound interest is only £900 after three years. You then need to defer the amount of interest you will pay on the loan for the PCP - Audi are around 7%"
You can probably tell I am new to leasing as never used before and as this is a pretty big purchase was just toying with the idea. In terms of cost its certainly attractive just paying a monthly fee and at the end of 3 years giving them back the car keys but is it really that attractive? I guess I am from the old school were if I can't afford it I can't have it.... but perhaps its time to change!!
"I'm old school too, i just pay cash and its done."
Still think that if DriveTheDeal can do 11.5% discount why can't the dealer match or even beat this? Or perhaps where I can make up the difference is perhaps in the trade in £ of my Q5??
Why - they don't want or have to in most cases.
Based on the fact that DRIVETHEDEAL can do 11.5% and they are a third party so dealing directly with Audi I would expect at least the same maybe more.
"Drive the Deal and other such companies can command the high discounts based on their past, present and future high volumes or orders from Audi. It's like any business, bulk buying gets you discounts, you are only buying one car, over a 3 year period or whatever"
Audi Salisbury matched my best Carwow deal 11.2% discount
"Excellent deal, on which model?"
"Yes, which model and was it a private single car purchase? Any part ex involved.I literally tested a SQ5 less then an hour ago........... I like. It had the 21'' wheels and it wasn't as firm as expected in fact my stock 20'' Q5 seemed firmer!! Having said that the dealer did not want to talk discounts on a new SQ5 and they offered me £27,000 for my March/13 Q5 S-Line with a number of options which they said was trade value the moment.Cheers"
"£27,000 also sounds like a good deal to me.Over 2 years old, I didn't think it would be that much.. you still want some discount off the new though!"
"Hi, Was deliberating over whether to swop my Q5 for SQ5 but unless I get a massive discount probably wont bother.

Yes waiting to hear from Nick7p as to what model etc.. his deal is based on.
My car recently went in because it sounded like there was a whistle on acceleration.The technician came out in the car with me and thought it was an induction noise.What it turned out to be was the steering rack bottom cover had broken and wind was whistling through it as I accelerated and also at constant speeds.Bit of a long shot but could be worth checking.
Mine has started doing this too! It hasn't always made this noise and I was going to ask for it to be checked.
"Thanks for the info markifa, this is not speed related but deffinately 'boost' noise at pull away and gear changes.As I am now more used to it I hardly notice it so it was probably just a new sound to me...I've spoken to dealer and they are fine, just waiting for a spare hour to get over to them for an opinion.Are you thinking steering rack or turbo?"

Thinking of trading in my Q5 2.0 TDI for an SQ5. Several different theories about when the SQ5 will be replaced and this will be either a good thing when buying one or a bad thing when selling one.. Appreciate some advice on whether you think this is a good time to spend loads of dosh just to upgrade to a faster machine...Cheers
I could be wrong but I did exactly the same as you at the end of last year and found from online research that we have an estimated 2-3 years of the current model left before a rework.The engine specs and equipment may be tweaked here and there but the the main design should not change.
its listed for summer next year.
It seems that some forum members think its 2-3 years away and you now say next year!! Where did you get your info from as even my local Audi dealer isn't quite sure!!
"A4 is listed end of this year, A5 Q1 2016 Q5 mid 2016until it appears, it can always move. R8 moved out 6months.SQ - no one knows, but Audi don't launch S models at the model launch, normally 6-12months after, so it all depends what your question ""really"" is."
I guess my point is how late would be sensible to order a current model SQ5 as with a new one on the horizon shortly expected depreciation has to be considered. Its probably a good thing to have Audi confirm the new model and then dealers cannot avoid giving bigger discounts should buyers wish to order the current model.
"Sq5john said:Sensibly speaking if depreciation is a concern that significantly affects your purchase decision do not buy a new car and especially one that is in it's last model year. Used values for SQs are falling and there is little doubt that the announcement of a new model will suppress them still further. You will probably lose around £10k in the 1st year, dealers discounting the vehicles just drives the residual values still lower.If it's an issue look for an 18 month old SQ, stick a private plate on it and be happy - new cars are only 'new' for a day in practical terms.Audi tend to launch cars with the most popular engines first, so take the new Q7, that just has one engine choice, and they have said there will one or two more by the end of the year. With the eco clouds on the horizon over diesel pollution I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the current SQ was the last of it's kind, sadly.Click to expand...So its a SQ7 Then?"
Yep agree with all said but still fancy a NEW SQ5 as used values are not that attractive at the moment!! I currently run a March/13 Q5 S-Line 2.0 TDI so unsure whether to wait and order SQ5 to coincide with its 3rd birthday so that will make it a March/2016 plate or get rid now and order for 65 plate. As for depreciation your 10k first year drop is certainly not reflected in the used cars being advertised but I am open to any comments from people who have sold/bought used SQ5's to change my mind.Cheers all.
"No, the car dealers are not selling them for 10k less, (or trying not too), but you trade in a 1 yr old SQ5, or attempt to sell it privately, and it will be heading rapidly toward that £10k loss"
"I'm currently leasing a 2013 SQ5. My lease ends in Dec. I would prefer to buy my next car instead of leasing. I don't like the idea of buying a car that's near the end of its cycle. however, I saw some 2015 SQ5 shared prices by others in autopriceshare are good. Basically I'm deciding between two options. Buy 2015 SQ5 or Wait For 2016 SQ5. Assuming the next model is just as good as the current one and isn't significantly more expensive, what would you do?"
"Assuming you are UK based - any car you order now will be a 2016, so it makes no difference.If you mean a new model, thats just not on the cards for a while."
"So ending in Dec of this year, I'd say that it's likely that the time table of the next Q5 release date will have solidified a bit more by then, its unlikely I guess to be any sooner than mid to late 2016, so you are going to have to find a vehicle to fill the gap."
"Hi, I am also looking at prices for the current SQ5. Have sent spec to CARWOW and so far have had two offers one of a 2.5% saving the other around 4%. I would not personally spend big money on a SQ5 unless there is at least a 10% discount and perhaps the longer you wait the bigger the discount!!"
Get a quote from a broker such as Carfile or Uknewcars. Just for initial purposes you can also spec up a car on their websites and get a real idea of what can be achieved. You are on the right track looking around 10%.....http://www.ukcarbroker.co.uk/http://www.carfile.net/
"That's absolute pony discount,my local just done me pal 8% ????"
Drive the deal have given me the best price to date. Equivalent to 12%.
"Test driven a SQ5 and was surprised by the power and the fuel economy. I like the looks of the car, the space in the rear and the boot size. I can feel the turbo lag/kick-in when putting my foot down, the steering wheel is a bit light and doesn't give much feedback. It doesn't feel safe to drive fast in country roads but that could be because it was my first time driving it?I'm also considering the S5. I know they are two different types of cars and both of them are about end of life. Assuming the new model will be out this year or early next year. The S model will probably takes another 6 months so it will be 2017 :S The MPG of both cars are similar on the paper, according to the fuel calculator on Audi website -http://www.audi.co.u...0Q5/carLine=SQ5I would like to hear the opinion of the SQ5/S5 owners in term of handling and fuel economy.Thanks."
"Handling the S5 is lightyears ahead, no real way around that.A4 is first, then A5 closely followed by Q5 in terms of replacement.So its a question of Coupe vs SUV, Petrol vs Diesel, Mid range grunt vs backlane fun."
is the drive select adjustable suspension option not on the SQ5?
No. not on the SQ
"Had an S5 cab and the SQ feels just as quick,however I found the S5 considerably less mpg than the SQ,I averaged 18mpg in the S5,it was the 3litre super charged,and the SQ averages 30mpg,as for handling the S5 seemed gr8,and the SQ is adequate ,it could b better but hey ho u can't have everything ????"
"I don't think you can compare the two in any other way than heart. I get my second sq5 on Monday and am trading in an s5. S5 had loads of power, averaged 24 mpg (versus 31 on last sq5) and the engine is great. However I missed the look, practicability etc of the sq5 and not really sacrificing much power to get it back. Think the q5 body shape has stood the test of time better whereas the a5 just looks common and like a sales reps carAlso auto tailgate is a must!"

"Good point but if one wishes to support UK plc what options are there;Morgan? not great for wafting comfortably between London residences.Bristol? no longer manufacturing cars.Aston Martin? cannot recall who currently owns them but Prince Charles owns a wonderful old DB6 volanteBentley & RR essentially posh Audi & BMW derivatives, Jaguar owned byTata etc;"
I believe Aston are still independenthttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martinand I would not refuse a McLaren.It is a scandal how the once great British car industry was allowed to fall into terminal decline.
Looks like the writing is on the wall.http://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/diesel-cars-could-be-banished-as-britain-ordered-to-cut-air-pollution/ar-BBiU8yJ
Time to depart from the EU then!
"Agreed.So, not only will my car be worth less (as no one wants a ""polluting"" diesel), I'm going to end up paying shed loads more for fuel as I'll have to buy a petrol engined vehicle that doesn't do as many mpg.........Looks like the government will win-win again as they will tax diesel more to discourage use of it, and if I change to petrol, I'll use more thus more fuel duty paid.J"
Is anyone considering selling up because of this? I bought the Q5 as a long-termer but am tempted to sell up and took at an S3 Sportback.
"It seems England only gets the raw end of the deal being part of the EU,HAVE WE EVER BENNEFITED FROM IT ,NO ????"
"justinlok said:Agreed.So, not only will my car be worth less (as no one wants a ""polluting"" diesel), I'm going to end up paying shed loads more for fuel as I'll have to buy a petrol engined vehicle that doesn't do as many mpg.........Looks like the government will win-win again as they will tax diesel more to discourage use of it, and if I change to petrol, I'll use more thus more fuel duty paid.JClick to expand...Fuel consumption with petrol Q5 undoubtedly higher than 2.0 diesel @ 28.2 average over 16k vs your 32.5 but no black smoke/soot or DPF problem and better refinement with significant performance advantage so not as bad as you make out. Horses for courses and all that."
"Selling because of - no, its not been concluded as yet, but the US petrol SQ is a mean beast, id swap the D. i don't care about the fuel, hell I'm happy to go etron if its better...I do agree D is a major problem in term of emissions and needs to be legislated."
Audi has successfully made diesel fuel from carbon dioxide and water. Carbon-neutral diesel is now a reality. - so stick that in your tail pipe government!http://www.sciencealert.com/audi-have-successfully-made-diesel-fuel-from-air-and-waterHopefully exempt from stupidly high tax/duty applied to regular diesel.
Heard that on the radio the other day. They are currently producing a barrel of blue crude a day so someway off mass production but it sounds interesting.
"I think I will hang on to my 1998 VW Sharan 1.9tdi with 232,000 miles in the hope of some scrap money."
Anybody know what current lead times are?
"Not sure, but aren't you tempted to wait 6 months or so and see if the all new Q5 gets announced?"
Approximately 3 months
"I would like to wait for the new model but there are risks (for me) in doing that. My head says to go with the current one, as long as I can negotiate the right deal. I think I can put up with running the current one (with the new engine) for three yearsIncidentally I am getting IRO 7.3% offers on Carwow vs the 10% I already have locked in - I thought the concensus was that discounts were increasing??"
May do if the new Q5 actually IS announced at some point
"Not looking for individual deals, but was curious as to in what sort of range the SQ5 is on a 2 year lease.."
Nationwide Vehicle Contracts have a decent quoting tool:http://www.nationwidevehiclecontracts.co.uk/Audi-Q5-leasing.htmlooks like its £485+vat
"Hmm interesting, why would people take 3 years over 2 for very little price difference...is this the same as PCP, i don't get it...So the back ground was around why buy a car (it was the R8 which he's said is around 1100/month - so on par if you scale the cost), when its cheaper to PCP, but at 500/month (for the SQ i cant see how thats so.. (JIMO) Maybe I'm missing something.."
"The reason for the longer term is to spread the deposit. Change after two years and you need the deposit again or every three years if you do that term.Leasing versus PCP is an often held debate, for me the lack of flexibility with leasing is unattractive."
"Yes I agree,some of these lease deals are amazing,I saw on 1 site a brand new Volkswagen Tiguan for £89 a month ,over 2 years with £1000 deposit, the would lose far more than that in depreciation ????"
"This is what the dealer is pushing for, so long story very sort the RS5 and or R8 is going an I'm looking at an RS6, now the logical or no brainer option is get the car at 86k (with option, less an undisclosed discount - which is a good one i think) and get a wad of cash back, but the dealer is saying lease it and put down only 10k and take a huge cash back with 1100/month payments."
An RS6 won't be the easiest to resell therefore leading makes a lot of sense as it removes that problem. If you are very certain of your mileage and can live with a fixed term go for it.
"I think its PCP rather than a lease, but its the same problem.."
"See it's all upside for the dealer (a sales, a kick back for the finance deal), but not so for a consumer - by doing a fix term they control supply and demand, you have no real choice at the the end of the term but to get something else. So its a perpetual cycle for the motor industry.I'm left somewhat undecided..."
"PCP is all about keeping the customer tied in to getting a new car every 3 or 4 years. Very common for dealers to ring up 6 months before a deal ends if the customer has some equity in the car, tell them they can get a brand new car for the same or lower monthly payment. In that situation many customers will blindly say yes please and tie themselves in for another term.Absolutely nothing wrong with PCP type deals so long as the customer fully understands the deal and ensures maximum discount each time. PCP has flexibility whereas leasing does not."
Has anybody purchased Audi aftercare? I'm waiting for my SQ5 coming in July and wondering if aftercare is wort it. Lots on construction around town and our house and not sure how many tires I want to invest in.
"I recouped my tyre and wheel insurance within 2M of ownership. So any more punctures or damage to rims in the next 2Y, and I'm quids in."
"Would you give a delivery company access to your boot, using keyless technology?http://www.audi.co.uk/content/audi/about-audi/latest-news/audi-brings-new-meaning-to-home-delivery-helped-by-dhl-and-amazon.html"
Very clever
Couple of flaws in that I think. Normally when I'm out the car is with me! Also this might be fine for saloons but anything like the Q5 if someone can get in the boot means they can get through in to the rest of the car.MT
"I thought you was going to post this one...the problem with the 2.5 is it sounds like a diesel at idle, i don't miss the noise, but i might have to get one."
"Doesn't matter if the car is with you, they will track & locate it wherever it happens to be at time of delivery, so being parked outside your work place, or restaurant, is no different to it being parked at your home."
Weren't Amazon also looking into the concept of parcel delivery by drones?Would love to be a fly on the wall in their innovation / R&D department...
"If it can keep up with you !!Dont know, I expect you'd have to give an approx location e.g 10 mile radius, for the time/day of delivery in advance.No problem if they've a UK network."
I filled up the washer bottle. When the bread knife come to use it it didn't work. The pump make a noise on the rear. But nothing on the front. I have had some coding done recently only needle sweep and dipping mirror.Any ideas.... Thanks
"hi, check connections and check the jets are clear at the front, use a safety pin to check each jet, if that doesn't work then I think you may need to take it a mechanic to test it fella.Ronan"
Could it be the coding ?
"Very high spec there,and mods,I reckon around £19-20 grand,good luck with your sale ????"
1
I thought removing the DPF made it an MOT failure. If that's the case I would have thought you have a very limited market.
"In view of the mods I'd go for the 'We Buy Any Car' option, no doubt based on the super spec it would be attractive as a straight used car (the remap etc will be a big negative to most buyers outside of a car forum)."
"It has been through two MOT's and passed both times, without any issues or questions relating to emissions. The DPF is still physically there, just the physical internals have been removed and the DPF functions disabled in the ECU. If a future buyer would like to reinstate the feature on a 6 year old car, then they could, though to what benefit I'm really not sure."
"I was thinking about advertising it around ~£17k private on AT\PH, which is less than any other example of similar spec\miles."
"That would b the cheapest on the net ,I to wouldn't mention the remap ,as most Byers would assume you've thrashed it ,17k is very reasonable ????"
"Give it a go, as always its dependent on what someone is prepared to pay, the car does have a fabulous spec for sure."
That would seem about right for a private sale. I would try WeBuyAnyCar. They gave me an excellent price and no hassle dealing with tyre kickers.
"Extras add no value.The car is worth around 17500, but with the remap id guess that will knock a few k off the price."
"if you are selling the boot liner im looking for one,as long as its genuine audi and would fit the sq?"
"Hi Vinny, it's not an Audi\OEM boot liner, I bought it from another Q5 owner off here a couple of years back. Fits perfectly though"
"ok forget the audi/oem part,are you selling,how much and are you on the east or west side of the weedge?"
"fivade said:I disagree with this comment. For many cars, perhaps this is true.But I spent quite a bit of time looking for a Q5 with the options I wanted. I expected to (and did) pay more to get one that had a good spec. Prices did vary, especially for those with/without sat-nav. In the Q5 almost everything is an option! and base-spec models with no options are pretty bare.I found myself being quickly dismissive of cars on autotrader that didn't meet my list of 'essential options', and I expect many other people will be willing to pay a bit extra for a well specced car.I do agree, however with the re-map. I wouldn't mention it.Click to expand...+1 ????"
try wewantanycar I've always found them to quote a higher price than webuyanycar..on my last car it was £700..

"Leather and Nav add value (and panoramic roof) the rest add no value at all - thats not my opinion, thats the market.People may be willing to pick up cars with higher specs or a certain colour, but they don't add value come trade in, however a car is worth only what someone is willing to pay..."
Spot on. I've learned that lesson on more than one occasion with trade ins. I write the cost of my options off now... and enjoy the advantage of them only during my ownership.

"Hi guys picked up my SQ on Saturday now insurance ( esure ) want me to fit a tracker because my car is over £50,000 is this normal or have you not had this problem ?Cheers Dave"
"Not had this problem, but mine wasn't specced over £50k either. Insurance did rise this year for no apparent reason (no claims made and additional years protected no claims to boot) from £350ish to £470 which was the cheapest I could get it after trying all the comparison sites."
"Nor me, I insured with Zurichhttp://www.zurich.co.uk/car/and they didn't ask for a tracker, like many insurance companies it's all done on line now however if you do need to talk to anyone then the call centre is in the UK and they were amazingly helpful when I declared the exhaust sound booster (long since departed), and rear bumper protector, just went as notes on the policy."
"I only have a Q not an SQ which was valued at £22,500 on the insurance and originally went with a quote from CIS Insurance from a comparison site. When I spoke to them to clear up a couple of things they said I had to have a tracker fitted or they would not insure me. I ended up going with the next cheapest quote which was Tesco. They just accepted the factory fitted security.Had a big argument with the CIS as they originally said I declared online that the vehicle had a tracker fitted, After I got them to check the phone calls I had with them I got a full refund of the money I had paid, they were going to charge me £36 to cancel."
Just renewed insurance with Direct Line for £240. Car cost was £54k and they did not mention a tracker.
"Insured wiith AA and no tracker required,+ I'd rather spend the £ on GAP INSURANCE ????"
Insured with Direct Line and no Tracker mentioned or requested
SQ is really cheap to insure - move insurers...!
Who wants a tracker? If some scrote nicks my car I do not want it back. Gap all the way.
"Personally I would never get a tracker fitted. Not only is it a huge invasion of privacy, but they have written into the contracts that the price can vary according to the data they receive. They of course sell this as ""we reward good drivers!"" but you can bet your life the price goes up more often than down. They quite simply would have you by the short and curlys which is not a position I want to be in with anyone let alone my insurer.My advice simply move to another insurer that doesnt insist on this."
+1 ????
"im with esure,premium is £340...car value is 40k...no mention of tracker"
"Hi,Each insurer will have their own specific terms when it comes to vehicle security. It's not unusual for insurers to ask for trackers on certain high value 4x4s.Regards,Dan."
"Are talking about a tracker or a data logger (how you're driving). Big difference between the two, one simply tells you where the car is (GPS), the other is a telemetric's system.Seems to be variance in peoples reply's to this?I guess if you live in a high risk (of car thefts) post code then I could see why the insurance company wants a ""tracker"" fitted. I have one personally but my insurance company (Admiral) have never stipulated it as a requirement.MT"
"I am not sure if anyone has mentioned this or tried this, when you set the cruse control at a given speed, then rapidaly drop the cruise control down 10+ MPH the brakes slow you down including brake lights being activated. This was apparent during doing 70MPH going into 50 MPH through speed cameras I thought the car would coast to the new set limit but not, good stuff."
"I disengage cruise, allow the speed to decrease then re-engage cruise. Time it right and you do not need to brake.Most of the nutters on the A90 seem to wait until they pass the 50 sign then brake.Do you remember this one >"
"My cruise control / speedo is -1 to Tom Tom speed at 70mph.I set my cruise control at 79, often passing those breaking for the 70mph ""safety"" cameras."
"I was caught speeding 60 pounds and 3 points for being 2mph over the national average limit, 10% +2 which equates to 79mph andi was doing 81 at Dunblane to Stirling..... Not happy at all"
"That sucks! Sorry to hear that, I got done at 59mph in a 50mph fixed speed section on the M40, then I got busted for 97mph on the M40 which I deserved, that was a few years ago but I'm a big fan of cruise control now to regulate my speed."
One of the the reasons for switching down from 300BHP. No point having it anymore with cameras all around sadly.
the Cruise Control (non-Adaptive) on my MY14 Q5 S-Line Plus is the best i have ever encountered - simple yet accurate and precise.i had a top of the range 15 plate Toureg for work the other day and the cruise was terrible - a simple tap up and down sent it up or down in 5mph increments - i had to hold it to move it up or down 1mph at a time and by then i had passed the speed i wanted and was trying to constantly over-correct.i love the cruise control currently on the Q5's - i hope they adopt the same style in the new Q5.
It may be of interest to those of you with children that Audi are offering the Rear Seat Entertainment pack for free on Q5 orders placed before 30th June. Received an e-mail today about it. assume it also applies to SQ5.
Probably not including any other discounts? Entertainment pack is £1200ish? Not going to be the same level as most discounts (4-8% of the list price) or they'll just build it all in and make it look zero cost. Nothing is free!!!MT
"Nice if the RSE package is a free offer but otherwise, I would never bother.Audi's own version is listed here athttps://www.audi.co.uk/content/dam/audi/production/PDF/PriceAndSpecGuides/AccessoriesGuides/q5-accessories-guide.pdfat a cost of £900 for the double player version.Or, as I did, you could go here:https://www.voyager-systems.co.ukPretty much exactly the same thing but for £200. No brainer really."
Why would they - you've already ordered...
Or just buy the brackets for you existing tablets from Amazon for £30 and you're done.
This plus iPad is better solution.
"Any chance I could have a copy of the email forwarded to me so I can speak to my finance company before mine is built, worth a shot ;-)"
"It will be an offer for cars ordered after.... or during the promotion period, where as you ordered before.Given your date (assuming to you, not build), your car will be confirmed already - so no changes possible.Making a change will move the date if its not locked.These are going to get more and more. the Q5 is end of life now so the offers/freebies will increase dramatically.Hence why the discounts are available."
"Actually my date has been moved back (that's a stressful point to offload at another time).I'm now scheduled for Build Week 25, so my spec isn't locked yet."
Does this offer apply only to the end of MY2015 or also to the early MY2016?What week will mark the change from 15 to 16?
i like ur logic...
haha well spotted!
I've recently got 2 x 32GB SD cards for the MMI3G system and a 32GB USB storage device for the AMI connection in the glove box. I split all my music between this storage leaving some room on each for additions. The problem is I noticed on some of the albums that the track listings do not follow what they should be (specially irritating on live albums) I thought I had just mixed them up when doing the transfer but I've had them out and back to the computer to look at the file listings and they are all listed as per # number so should play as such in the car.Anyone got any Idea's as to what has happened to ix these up once they are connected in the car?thanks
I found when transferring to the SD card - particularly when having a large playlist of many tracks from various albums/artists - I had to export from iTunes to the play list in a format with correct structure including track number and including a .m3u file to control how it plays. You might find it easier to find software that does all this for you - there are loads out there for Windows or Mac. Otherwise Google the problem and you will see how people have manually done it including editing m3u files.
Just want to point out - when I say track number for a large various artist playlist I mean inserting a unique index in the order I want the songs to play at the start of the title. Playlist Export on the Mac does this and I think MediaMonkey on Windows may handle it too.
when i copied the files from itunes they had track numbers etc so i deleted them and now appear in alphabetical order.
"If you're listening to a live album where the tracks run into each other, they have to play in the correct order or it doesn't sound right. That's the problem I'm having."
"I believe MMI is only able to read mp3 ID3.x tags (or WMA tags). If you have other version of tags embedded, then it might not be readable and music will be sorted either alphabetically by file name or by file order on media (not sure that). I'd start with software like MP3TAG (http://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to rewrite your files with correct tags. This will not re-encode music itself, just write ned, proper tags into file, so no worry about loss of quality. Hope this solves the problem."
I'll look into that over the weekend and try it on that one album to see what it does with the tracks.thanks
"I'm sure you are correct here, I used to (mistake) think it was the track name that determined the sequence, but it's that hidden # tag that does the deed."
"There are different setting available for ID3 tags. I used MP3TAG with following settings (Tools->Options->Tags->Mpeg):Read: all checkedWrite: checked only ID3v2, ID3v2.3-ISO-8859-1Remove: checked ID3v1, APEI also found some interesting summary of MMI capabilities here (however it is for 2014+):http://pl.scribd.com/doc/229621369/Audi-A4-3G-MMI-Entertainment-System#scribd"
"Tried the same things I did before with the settings suggested by mirekmal with the same results. It must have something to do with something else that is beyond me. I've never used this software before and really don't know what I'm looking to change to get them to play in the correct order, it all looks right when you see the files in the folder, they are all listed in the order they should play but they don't once they are in the MMI. Other albums play in order but I cannot see why this one would be different.Maybe I need to create a m3u file for this album."
"Tried something else, it doesn't need the m3u file to recognise the correct order of play. Just put the track number at the front of each song title and it works. that's less work than creating the m3u files."
Isn't that exactly what I said right at the start? Unique index at the start of the title!Glad you got it sorted anyway.
"The majority of albums don't have a track number at the start of the title but they play in the correct order, it was that specific album that was boiling my p***"
"MickStrewth, It's years since I listened to UFO, saw them in Nottingham in 1983.Going to play it straight away.Thanks for the reminder"
I had that album on Vinyl then replaced it on CD but it has to be listened to in the correct order with it been a live performance.
"Looking good ,can't wait 2 c those new wheels on ????"
"Dont like the 20's, not for me, would rather have the 21's as a replacement if need be, enjoying so far , wife is loving it aswell"
"got stopped 4 speeding today ,doing 32 in a 30, got let off and told to slow down,but was also advised to tell DVLA that my car has changed colour,I said the company that wrapped it said as it's not permanent I don't have to,the copper then said well it's a grey area ,I said MATT GREY, he smiled and drove off ????"
I wonder if you were stopped because of the car colour and the speeding was an excuse. 32 in a 30 is not within the agreement of ACPO.http://www.pepipoo.com/files/ACPO/ACPO_enforcement_guidelines.htm
are regs same in Scotland or are they different?
"See thats your problem - you slowed down.. head down, foot down and go!"
Police are not permitted to stop for no reason and have to justify it. I got stopped once and they told me there have been a lot of thefts lately and we wanted to check this was my vehicle <LOL>.
The ACPO guidelines only apply to England and Walesin relation to Scotland it has a separate jurisdiction and criminaljustice system.
"just reading the speed limit and as Edinburgh is going to get a 20mph speed limit, I was hoping that 25mph would keep me clear of brown envelopes with offers of 3 points. It will be ok in my wifes 1.4 polo as speed is aspirational rather that my Q where 20 will require even more concentration. It appears this is classed as a trial but me thinks we may be stuck with it. What is your thoughts as a matter of interest?"
I forgot to attach the links:http://www.20splentyforus.org.uk/PRel/Edinburgh.pdfhttp://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/20mph-zones-may-go-scotland-wide-after-edinburgh-trial-1-3051253#comments-area
"20 mph near schools is fine,but I do think it's about time they increased the points on our driving licence to 20 now,the current limit of 12 was set over 20 years ago,before speed cameras were down every road ????"
but that would defeat the purpose of additional enforcement..
"It always amazes me the people who are ""Totters"" ( acrue 12 points) and face a ban then plead exceptional hardship with all sorts of excuses. Strange they didn't consider their excuse before committing the offence. You would think that getting to 9 points would Instill caution but not so. The Idea of 12 points is a warning. To increase to 20 would not only give the green light to offenders but also continue to risk lives."
"I disagree the 12 point system was implemented b4 speed cameras existed,there for the current 12 allowance is outdated ,just like speed limits on motorways,as cars brakes are far better now and stopping distances are less,majority of cameras are there for revenue,especially the hidden ones,if they really wanted to slow people down to prevent accidents they wouldn't have speed traps,I have no points and never have (and hope not to),but no many people that have and they weren't driving like nutters ,is there a real allowance to be over the speed limit ? í ¼í¸²"

I ask as I recall that the Freelander 2 had little in common with other LR vehicles and, perhaps consequently, is known as probably the most reliable SUV they've made.Their comment almost certainly applies to the Freelander 1, cant remember what exactly used to go wrong but many many of them ended up with the rear prop removed and in FWD mode only.If the FL2 was one of the most reliable vehicles theyve ever made then my dads must have been a Friday afternoon car, what a pile of st it was. He had it for 14 months and it was constantly in the garage, mostly with electrical gremlins. Eventually a turbo or injector or something went and enough was enough, traded in for a Touareg which has been literally faultless (and a nicer place to be) for about 5 years now. trevalvole said: "

"Hi everyone. Need some advice. I’ve always bought new or nearly new and it’s that time again to change car.My previous two cars were a Hyundai IX35 and then a Renault Kadjar. I’m a large guy and like a big car.This time round I was all set on a nearly new Hyundai Tucson or Santa Fe, however I’ve stumbled across a 3yr old top of the range, top spec Audi Q5 S Line Plus that’s in my price range. However it has 82k miles on the clock.My mate who is a car salesman (boo hiss) says that is nothing for this car.What do you think? I really need impartial advice.The car has full Audi service history. "
TheNSA said:What do you think? I really need impartial advice.How long do you intend to keep it? What's your annual mileage? TheNSA said: 
I intend to keep it 2 to 3 years. Annually mileage maybe 15k or so.Thanks. 
"Pros: Better quality ( in terms of feel ), better driving, more stylish, more prestigious car. All subjective and debateable of course.Cons: It WILL cost you more in maintenance over the next few years than a nearly new car. How much more - impossible to say but £0-2000 more would be a reasonable range.If you really fancy the Audi and you are prepared to stand the risk of additional maintenance costs then go for it. If you look at the Audi and your personal opinion is that you can't tell Stork from butter, or if you don't think it's worth the risk of additional running costs then stick with a nearly-new. "
"OK, in that case you need to work out if selling a 5/6 year old Q5 with 110/130,000 miles will be easier than shifting a Tucson etc...Personally I'd go with the nearly new (in warranty) option. "
This thread is pretty much validating my own thoughts.It comes with a 3 year dealer warranty as well btw.I’m going out tomorrow to test drive it alongside new / nearly new Kia’s and Hyundai’s. We shall see. 
"TheNSA said:It comes with a 3 year dealer warranty as well btw.The 82,000 mile Q5? TheNSA said: "
"The warranty will cover parts which fail but not parts that wear out.Parts that wear out will include brake discs and pads, clutch plate, suspension bushes, steering components etc. The Q5 will surely do another 82000 again, but will need repair and and maintenance to get there. "
"Ok that kind of advice has sold me against the Q5. This is the st they don’t tell you about dealer warranties.The branch has a nice, black, mid-upper range 17 plate Tucson that will cost me less than I’m paying just now.Think i’ll put my sensible pants on and take that option. "

Thanks to all who helped in this thread. I'm now driving a nice 17 plate Tucson. However... all is not well lol. About to start another thread asking a question. 
"Hi All,I am looking at Q5's to replace my wife's MK5 Golf GTI.As there are limitations with dealers being open at the moment and lot of them requesting deposits, and no contact purchase etc, it' seems it will be difficult to get to drive a Q5 with both engines to compare (2.0T or 3.2). We are not planning to buy new, so it will be unlikely that a local non Audi dealer would have both engines available to test drive. We will test drive before committing to a purchase, however, as you can appreciate, I want to limit contact and I don't want to waste anyone's time either.I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on what what engine suits the Q5 best? There are not many 3.2's around, so is it worth waiting for one with the right spec to come up? or is the 2.0 sufficient?Thanks,Ads. "
IMHO SUVs are always better with a torquey motor. They're certainly not sports cars so a wafty engine is preferable. 
The 3.2 is the sweeter engine & suited to the the Q5. 
Looks like the 3.2 gets the most votes then. Thanks.I'll keep an eye out as three are only 3 in budget on AT. Plus I need to sell our car first. 
"I have a 2019 Q5 Quattro with the 45 TFSI (245 BHP) engine and don’t mind it. I drive to work and back on speed restricted roads and sometimes jump on the motorway for a junction or 2 for change of scenery. I also have access to and frequent use of (once a week to work and back) a 2017 SQ5 (petrol).It’s not rocket science to guess which I prefer but if you aren’t going to be able to thrash it around then the 2 litre is fine. It’s very light and easy to handle, it just whines a bit when I accelerate compared to the burble of the SQ5. I wouldn’t want to pull a caravan in mine though, you’d need the 3L for that.My wife has a 2017 Disco 5 3L diesel and I actually prefer the drive in mine to hers as it’s much less prone to roll, but hers is a nicer place to sit and a better driving position.

"2.0T is actually a great engine and suits the Q5 well. With a remap it’s the same power, if not slightly faster than the 3.2. Doesn’t sound as nice however "

For clarification, yes, I will be looking at the first gen model with a budget up to around £18k, which sadly rules out the SQ5.The car will be used as a family car, carrying bikes (will need to fit a tow bar) and for camping maybe twice a year (may need a roof box as camping with an A6 Avant has been challenging due to the size of the air tent). "
Come on then - Q5 vs GLC vs X3. Which are you choosing? VOTE below!
I’m always blown away when adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is optional when it’s standard on a corolla 
"I shortlisted the 2021 GLB,GLC,X3 and Q5. Took all of them out for a lengthy test (some received 3 test drives) The driving experience is overrated with the X3 in my opinion. I was shocked because all the reviews speak to its sportiness and better driver engagement. To be completely honest I much preferred  the Q5 driving experience much more. The Q5 has the identity of would I expect a “luxury family” SUV to be. It was plush, quiet, comfortable and had more than enough power in all situations. The others felt a bit harsh compared to it. Maybe my expectations are different than the other reviewers."
This looks more and more decent choice for a city SUV. I'm amazed at the way they strike a balance between volume and vehicle size.
"The new Q5 is a lovely car, but somehow I feel that the first one, especially the facelifted B8.5 generation, was the best looking. Thanks for the vid!"
"Great review, as always. But I've noticed that car reviewers never mention the safety features of a car. It's always the design, the interior and in Matt's case, the log of truth and the drive . But safety, which is one of the most important reasons why families buy such cars, nada."
"Nice review. 32 MPG equals 7.35 L/100 km. Which is actually awesome for a car like this with powerful tubro-4. Given that the modern diesel motors are cut in power due to environment regulations, for most people I guess 2.0T would be the most adequate choice if you average 20-25 thousand KM per year. If you do more than 50 thousand km, then the economy from diesel will be more substantial. However I doubt it is very important in 50-60k USD car."
"I think it's interesting to compare these to Model X, EQC, Etton and Ipace. I know motor journos are generally treating ICE and EVs as two different worlds. But in reality a lot customers are actually choosing between both. And although the EVs are on paper miles more expensive, when you boil it down to a monthly total cost that gap closes a lot (especially for a company car)."
"I'd go for the BMW X3 as it looks like a nicer place to be than the other two and as for the car having the dirty rear end, why don't manufacturers just fit something like a very thin roller blind just inside the back where the lip is that just pulls up and out then drapes down over the back of the car, or if the car has a retractable parcel shelf which clips in, fit another two clips just inside the rear of the car and use the parcel shelf as a cover for the rear end of the car, only the underside of the parcel shelf would get any grime on it which wouldn't be seen when put back where it should be, then when you lean into the car, you wouldn't get dirty breeks."
"I received a GLC for a loner car while my E-Class was having an oil change. I would give the GLC a 9/10. The interior was posh and stylish, the ride quality was super and was surprisingly fast. The infotainment was fast to respond but took like 2 days to get used too."
"The perfect wagon. Not too big, not too small, exuberant quality, practical to use, satisfying to drive."
For a second I got really excited that they introduced real exhausts! But this is still better than those atrocious plastic panels on the pre-facelift model
I love how Audi are not shying away from diesel  engines like other brands 
"Had the petrol one of these on test recently, which is NOT the one to buy. Lack of lowdown power and the ride was too firm as you need Air suspension and only gets 30 mpg on a run. So unless you can get a big discount, the diesels are the ones to go for as the engine suits the car a lot better and has better fuel economy over the petrol. The car is still very spec sensitive, with black alloy wheels to be avoided, plus arguably not as good looking at versions of a few years back too."
"The top of the range Audi Q5 TFSI e could have been called the Audi SQ5 TFSI e, since it’s got more power than both the petrol and diesel SQ5."
"Those inserts in the glove box lining are for SD cards which you needed (at least in the prefacelift model) for the audio system. Also this test car doesn’t have the DVD player in the glovebox. So I guess that’s gone due to the new MMI 

All in all they could have updated the dash more snd not had those small cube holes. Even my pre facelift has the thin slot and tiny space at the front from which items fly out!  

The wireless charge pad is annoying. Any tall cups block it from sliding forward so then you can’t access the compartment under the armrest!!

Shame they did not adopt the Q3 centre console"
"Matt, do a group test with the M135i, S3, Golf R, A35 to see which is best overall. Not just drag races but everything included."
"Really Like to see the SQ5, vorsprug it’s a different beast and gotta be worth the review. Maybe best in its class where as I definitely think there is better options at 2ltr SUV as Matt has shown here."
When talking about fuel economy it would be nice if editor could add a conversion to l/100km 
Cars should do that more with the lights. Have them as options too because sometimes some people just want the nice lights or can’t afford the whole next trim so they gota get stuck with some sorry ass lights. Just make it an option!
"Matt really hates a load lip in the boot, I actually prefer it because loose items don’t slide out of the boot when you’ve parked at an incline."
"I think the SQ5 will replace my Q3 sooner than later. Hopefully, before they make the whole line electric. The US hasn't really bought in well to the whole EV thing."
"I would buy Volvo XC60, I think it is a better designed and engineered car overall. Also for the same price you het much more assistant systems(lane keep assist etc.)"
"""I got to be fair and consistent across all cars.""

I felt that."
This facelift looks good IMO.
"I have a 2014 3.0 TFSI SQ5 and recently rented a 2.0 Turbo gasoline X3 for one week during a family vacation, and the X3 is the better all-around car. It’s just more practical and easier to live with"
"The SQ5 is still much slower than the X3 M and M40i.  If Audi could actually match the performance, I would consider switching over."
"Great review Mat, as always! Could you make the review of BMW X3 LCI, please? Would be great to know your opinion on these updated germans!"
Hi Matt does this still have the delay when pulling out of junctions like the pre-facelift (2L diesel) did?
This video contains just the perfect amount of humor and information. Keep it up Matt!
"11:00 Matt you deserve an Oscar award, for the annoying things about the boot. I sure you had a hard time to bring out the annoying things about the load lift."
I’ve never seen Matt so not in the mood for a car review like this one 
Big respect to the cameraman at 9:25 very diligently recording matts sillyness. haha
Good review. No doubt. Q5 is the most reliable of this 3 cars!
Mat walk the review at a very good pace... And is humorous.
"Nice refresh on Audi Q5 ... Audi, Volvo & other over the pond vehicles used to have amber/orange rear turn signals, can see better & safer too. Bring them back !!! Good review !  Slainte' !  Cheers !"
"Is it me, but the more i watch Mat, i wonder why he was never an option for Top Gear!"
"This facelift really works on this car, those wheels are sick too"
Excellent review as usual. Love your sense of humour!
"When you pull the back seats a bit forward, you can store the back lid in the little gap that appears behind the seats"
"The little slit in the center console storage is actually for the key fob itself. At least, that's what it was like in the A4 I drove. Otherwise, it's pretty pointless. lol."
"My 6 year old f10 five series just started having issues with headlights condensation. To see this on a brand new car, like the one in the video, would trigger me so hard."
"Love the exterior but the interior displays and design needs to change, its starting to age (the seats are nice however)"
The boot space is actually 520 litres not 550 that Matt said.... according to the Audi Q5 site...so I would pick X3. No full leather as standard is crap at this price.
I hope you can do the SQ5 and SQ7 soon as I’m considering both of these.
"Do a mk3 focus RS vs the GR Yaris, should be interesting, they both cost more or less the same now, 4WD, manual, rally inspired, etc."
"Yo, mat is going off with these reviews"
Having room for 3 isofixcar seats is great - however having one of them in the front is a massive negative. We need 3 isofix seats in the back row so 2 adults can ride in the front. Please can you review the best cars for 3+ children
Love the German accident and every time he throws away the back cover into the bush  hahahaha
This looks more sporty than the old
Carwow! The only car reviews I take seriously.
This one looks better then the old one 100%
Matt - the reason that there are small back lights when you lift up the tailgate is that in the US it is illegal not to have any lights showing.
Matt Watson is like Dominic Toretto. He lives is life a 1/4 mile at a time
"Before I start watching Interior, I have to say Fakery and Audi are like Best Friends nothing can separate them."
"Hi Matt, please review the 2021 Audi Q7 if you can. Would love to hear your thoughts on it!"
Awesome video as per usual Mat!
10:50 the car is not allowing the seat to completely fall off because if there is anything fragile on the seat it may crush them...
"Would it be worth moving from a 2019 Q3 to a Q5? Is it that much better? Bigger, bigger engine as standard, more practical for 2 kids?"
"Audi with a small back window: Yeah that's pretty good
Other cars with small back windows: That's pretty bad

You can tell he like Audis."
It’s a great day (or night) when Carwow uploads a new video!!!!!
Thanks for the review - great info as always
These intros are getting better and better everyday️️
I am confused between glc and q5 which one is better to buy
"I think mat u should also check the horn sounds of every car u review, that would also be fun to do"
"Must be pretty massive for the boot to carry 7 ""airplane-sized"" carry-on luggages @10:22! Love that humour."
"I've ordered one. It's just a clean, tidy, and equipped SUV (hate that term).. Im happy with the choice"
This guy is very entertaining.  I forget that I am trying to learn about vehicles.  Fun!
Pre-facelift Q5 looks so nice
Would buy one apart from the cost.. maybe a 3 year old one in three years!
I have both of the Q5’s right now 15 plate and 71 plate and the 15 plate feels much more premium i know the technology aged on them the most of the plastic you touch everyday feels more cheaper and plasticky on 71 plate…
İ wonder why audi didn’t change the dash like the other audi’s which is gorgeous
"""I forgot my hands are all dirty""  That made me laugh out WAY harder than it should have."
"For every car Mat reviews, he MUST find at least one annoying thing about the boot so he can lead into the 5 Annoying Things . What if its the perfect boot??"
"The engine is probably an optional extra, only comes as standard on the Vorsprung model."
Hi Mat and carwow crew! Could you please make a new and updated review of Mercedes EQC? Thank you in advance for the answer!
"I dont understand why Audi decided not to give this the integrated infotainment screen like in all other new Audis.
This is a last gen interior in a new premium car... Really is a shame"
Is the fog in the headlights an extra option as well? 
The front design though 
I’m so glad I have this engine….on the A4! 
those little holders in the glove compartment are for SD cards. For your camera or the radio nav thingy in the glove compartment.
"I am so annoyed because they got rid of the mmi wheel and it’s all touch controlled now. BMW has both, why can’t Audi? Will keep my 2018 A5 with the mmi wheel as long as I can."
"In the US that car is basically a Premium Plus SQ5, but with a 4 cylinder"
"Put it this way at the moment I cannot afford this car but in five years for sure I can get it, but guess what I'm not going to have I will go to x3 at least from this times is coat real exhaust . And my present car it's Audi from 2013 and it's got 2 nice real pipes in the back"
Could you test the GLC Facelift as well?
Awesome car  great job Mat
"This should have the wireless Android Auto, @Matt Watson you missed this important update. I have the 2020 Q5 and it's the same tech as the 2017 model ️"
Mat - tell us if/why a Q5 is worth x thousand more than the equivalent A4 Avant
I prefer the Tiguan 5 seater 2021. Cheaper and I think more spacious inside as well with a built in screen instead of a stuck on ipad!
the facelifted one looks like a bigger Q3 from the front side.
"Mat : Hesitating to throw the parcel tray
Me : Throw it, Throw it, Throw it"
"Should do a race by car only of your favourite brand to your favourite brands hq, so yianni can only drive a lambo the whole race to get to the lamborghini hq, and you have to drive only bmws for the race to get to bmw hq, 3 car changes have to be done in between."
Matt's German accent is the best.
"Defintely best looking in the segmente, along with the xc60"
"Yes, shortlist the Q5 and then go for the GLC"
How does this compare to the jaguar f pace? Or doesn’t it?
Looks good but the xc60 looks better IMO
that load lid is to prevent stuff from falling out when you open the boot and the second rear lights are us regulation
Helpful video. Does anyone watch these videos and wonder what car Mat Watson drives? Which car e choose given all the ones he test drives?
I wonder when the gv70 comes out how will it compared
"Love that Alfa Romeo logo metal bottle, god job mat"
matt is the type of guy to give you your five annoying things after the first date
I think Mat slowly grew up until he was 35 and now he's developing backwards again :D
"5:36 that little space is for your keys, as I have seen the q5 keys, they’re huge but perfect to fit there"
@carwow could you also please make a review of the new Audi SQ7 TFSI. That would be nice
Great looking car
"Awesome title! I can already imagine what the others will be:
New A4: better than C class and 3 series?
New S class: better than A8 and 7 series? 
New 5 serires: better than A6 and E class?"
Imagine carwow without Matt Watson 
"The day Mat and Yianni have a running race, its going to break the internet."
Please review the new 2021 Jaguar F-Pace if possible. I am looking to lease it but would like to get a second opinion from you Mat :)
Mat's scarf is like Audi's exhaust pipes :)
Audi finally listened to Mat about the cup holders at the back.
"Another top review, Matt you are superb  Another boring SUV though.
When are you reviewing the I20N?"
I have been watching Carwow for years but this is the first time I am watching it for a car I’m buying feels super weird
Considering Audi will sell more of the base model it would make more sense to review the base model.
Mat's German accent is so hilarious.
"Nice, the interior is the best I’ve seen, better than any other SUV"
At least not as many vents as seen on the civic type r.
'Don't worry there is plenty to like about this car' - no carwow video misses this phrase
Audi could’ve hid the exhaust a little bit better than they did can see the exhaust bend down right before the fake exhaust tips
Day 5 of asking for a bicycle race between Mat and Yianni
"Having worked with VW that's precisely what they'd  say ""Why are we giving zis idiot ze car?"". Still laughing "
Anyone else finds it curious to have an Edition 1 on a redesign?
"Please do a review of the 2021 SQ5 TDI with 48V mild hybrid, wagon or sport back, vorsprung or otherwise!!!!"
Need a 2021 Range Rover Vogue/ Discovery / Evoque reviews with the new infotainment and Steering wheel updates. Love!!
12:20 those little lights are legal in the us on Audi as they cant have lights on any moving parts of a vehicle
That suv is gorgeous but the interior is now kinda ageing
15:41 they actually went and re-shot that scene from a POV perspective infront of the Q5 instead of just using a generic cut away to pre recorded footage. The camera man/production team either need a pat on the back for attention to detail or a rollocking for wasting time on something so small.... I appreciated it tho 
I'm confused as to why you compare Q5 against X3 and Q7 against X5...in the US the Q5 is comparable to an X5 and the Q7 to an X7
X3 all the way
This not just a cupra ateca with a nicer interior? VW does it again 
13:25 you made my day 
I’m always happy to hear “ze German”  Mat!  
"Could I get a price on this Q5? Should get quite a bit off after matt has scratched, bumped and poked it with a stick "
"LOL!!!! BRAND NEW......and it's already got a 'check engine light' on it!!! Well played Audi, well played!! SERVUS! :)"
The strip at the back should be the light (you know like in Porsche Macan)
"Between those 3, Q5 sells the least in Australia."
"@carwow Matt, can you please compare the SQ5, Macan and X3 M40i"
A6 all the way :)
Review the 2021 X1 please Mat!
It’s hard time deciding wich car to take.. I’m looking for a sporty car with my girlfriend.. enough space for two of us.. maybe when we need some space if someone riding with us.. we also got a horse.. so suv would be great or something with decent power and prefer all wheel drive .. maybe 3 serie g20 .. or cla 45/35 or a suv .. budget is like 60k Max.. it’s really hard haha
Don't like how the rear tail lights disappear once the rear is opened. Those small bumper lights wouldn't be visible enough at all
"My dad loves this car, we wants to get used one  from 2019 series."
A decent SUV ... at an indecent price.
"9:25 There we go, we see a camera man there, right Matt."
The load lip is practical when parked on an upward incline
"The reason I'm doing this is because of ""I'm Matt Watson, and this is car wow""... best line."
Black trim on this Q5 looks better than the silver trim
Love Mat’s German accent
Can you please carry out a comparison review with the new 2021 Range Rover Velar?
My favorite X3
"The Audi, BMW & Merc in this segment all have older interiors & base designs than the rest of the cars in their stables. Whoever comes out first with their next generation is going to be way ahead."
"Matt, the front isofix is the one you use when you're alone so you see your toddler when you drive. Grownup kids go at the back anyway"
"Audi is always introducing new facelift models but fail to deliver their orders in time. My Q5 2021 model has been postponed for the fourth time. Original ETA (car was ordered in Apr-21) was Jan-22, then postponed to Feb-22, then Apr-22 and now I a got message the car was postponed until Nov-22. I wouldn't rely on the promises of audi"
Matt I know you guys sometimes find it hard to understand for instance the coin holders or the smaller phone holders on these cars. But you have to understand that they sell these cars globally and here in South Africa for instance we use coins and cash a lot still. As well as a lot of the older folks still have Iphone 5's and 6's so they fir nicely in those smaller areas. I understand for the EU market it might be weird but the EU cars are sold almost as is in the African market so I guess that is why they keep some of these smaller things. I am not an engineer though so I could be 100%
"Looks like a pretty uninspired vehicle with lots of competition that's better. and you're right that is the slowest sun shade I've ever seen on a pano roof
I find that car SUV or whatever hugely unappealing.."
"Mat,in German, Vorsprung is pronounced as ""Fore-sproong"""
Why does Mat always get a different stick of truth for the closeup shots than he has for the wide shots ️️
"C'mon Matt Watson!!! Test the SQ5 2016 model PLEASE!!!
Twice now just Q5 
Best suv Ive ever had!
V6 bi-turbo diesel, fast, real exhausts, great boot & seats, sounds good, gear box awsome!!"
"The Q5 frame is the same of the cayenne, urus, q7,Q8 is a superior frame not the same for Mercedes and BMW. They use forte the medium size suv the same poor frame of the small size auto"
"Not sure if it’s better than the GLC, since you guys haven’t reviewed it yet.."
what about GLB? better than GLC imo
"Mat: Puts hands in mouth
Also Mat: I I forgot my hands were dirty 
Me: Its corona time"
I wish Audi would give the widescreen map view using CarPlay/Auto in the driver’s display. Cmon Audi!!
I love his german impression 
12:24 that's because it's a Law in US that taillights(break lights) cant be on a moving part and so they fit the light downwards
"Audi must have a different setup for the American market because you can’t have the tailgate go up with no lights on the back , just for the reason mat said makes him uneasy"
For what you said about silence strong engine this happing to all suv cars. For example BMW X3M or X5M has 0-60 time around 3.5 seconds but you still not feeling the power. The answer is simple: Distance from the ground act like a silent barrier!!!! Thank you for the video!! Carwow is my favorite!!!!
The Q5 Facelift looks so nice
Loving the frequency of the great content
When i saw the parcel shelf it felt as if it was very aerodynamic. It was.
Audi hasn’t changed the design on the q5 in ages
Great! I was thinking of buying this car. It's helpful that you removed it at the right time.
Did Mat forgot the fake vent behind the car?
"Every car gets carbon, we gonna cringe so hard at this in 20 years."
Rear light design is exactly the same with the original Q5
"He never mentions that, although some offers on Carwow look attractive, they are only available if you lock into a toxic PCP scheme. Encouraging debt is not a good idea in my view, it's a disincentive for those who work hard and save money"
Just wondering...has anyone ever used the coin slots in any car?
At this point you dont even need to use the stick of truth on Audis
Can we get a review of the updated Mercedes GLC/coupe and BMW X3
9:25 Finally we got to see the camera man  
"Am I one of the few who uses the car's system instead of Android Auto or if I had an iPhone, their system? I wish Audi kept the MMI wheel when they added the touch screen. I love using it when driving. Much easier."
The Mexican Q5 is more expensive than the German GLC...no way !
I love Audi Q5 
"Had the regular q5 kept the proper quattro then yes, but niw with quattro ultra...nah. Now you need the aq5 to get tge proper quattro."
Am I the only one who always goes back to the parts with German accent imitation 
"VW group, BMW, VW group, BMW, VW group, BMW, Mercedes, VW group, BMW, Mercedes. This is pretty much all CARWOW does."
I see you laughing about the coin holder… well in certain areas in Germany there are car parks where you can still only pay in cash and there is even one where you can’t get your change back so thank you indeed Audi for still giving us this feature. 
I've owned and driven Audi's since the 80's. I left a short while ago and it's clear I'll stay away. It makes me weep how they've so lost their way.
Awesome review!
I have a 2022 Q5..I regret trading my 2018 for it ..the quality went down hill I believe!! I hate that weird humming sound it makes . My 2018 didn't and I just does NOT drive the same at all ..stuck with it for now
Looks nice 
Did the editor forgot about the footage with the newest GLC?
"Please review the genesis gv70, it competes with the q5, x3 and glc"
"The glc and q5 are cars I really dislike, if i had to choose a car in this class it would definitely be there lexus NX. unashamedly focused on comfort Which is the way it should be, it also comes with much note standard equipment and far far superior reliability and customer service."
And how is it towing a horsebox especially interested in the 0 to 60 for that...
So basically what youre saying is its a big suv that cant carry 5 people and is fairly unpractical/ or a bit dated throughout
I love the new Audi Q5
9:25 camera man spotted. I alway thought a magical floating camera filmed Mat and now the magic is ruined.
the review I wanna see is all the mechanical details just how close is it to macan
"I don't know if it's just me, but I don't really care if a car has touch sensitive climate control, because I usually just set it to one temperature and only change it a couple times a year."
Everything in this car is optional….on standard version you only get a picture of it…
Matt didn't really compare it to the X3 nor GLC. More compared it to the XC60. What gives Matt???
The Audi Q5 TFSi actually beat the a hot hatch
The infotainment is so on point
"I'm pretty sure everyone wants a ""Mat-Watson-doing-silly-accents-compilation"""
It's the most beautiful SUV for everyone.
Random Fact: The Pre-Facelift AUDI Q5 is Slower Than The 1st Generation  Post-Facelift AUDI Q5
The coin holders are for the German market because our supermarket carts need little coin like chips to make sure you return them.
The new mercedes EQS 2022 the interior is incredible
Audi actually made full oval 4 exhaust pipes that have chrome tips and they are fake on the SQ5 or RSQ5. Toooo fake.
5:55 New S21 Ultra and he has already broken it 
Can you review new toureg and touaran? I think they are amazing.
waiting for audi RS8 without soft limiter
"I won't recommend to keep the hints in wireless charger beside the cup holder's that might be filled with coffee, water or any other liquid."
Looks really nice in those monochromatic colors and without chrome parts... but that’s got to be the ugliest rear end in the world when the tailgate is opened !
13:25 me (a german) loved that one
Still think I’ll take a rover over any of them.
Why do you worry about running out of road at the quarter mile tests? Its the same distance with every single car :D
Why not compare it against an X5?
"12:20, how can that make you uneasy? If the boot lid is up, you won't have lights. At least this gives you lights so other road users can actually see you."
4:20 nice check engine light!
U guys can't possibly have watched it seconds after uploading 
can we get a drag race of R34 GTR vs Supra MK4? maybe even boosted and tuned.
That's one of the best intros I have ever seen 
I love AUDI 
"Q5 used to be the hottest, most attractive suv 15yrs ago... now it's like... meh~ what happened?"
You guys should do the Porsche 911 turbo s vs keep track hawk!!!! Can’t find any good ones on YouTube
"I'll post it here again till Mat sees:

My Mrs pointed out that Mat's Instagram is basically 
'Ma Twats On Cars' 
and I can't unsee it "
The previous version looks much better
Matt is really funny 
"I was hoping he was going to yeet the load cover in the woods at 10:07
Edit: 13:20 Lets goooo"
You should do a review on the 2021 Land Rover 110HSE xdynamic defender
Matt isn't this the older model! The new Q3 is a very different car
5:40 key holder Mat:)
The new Genesis GV70 makes many of these midsized level SUVs look rather boring . The GV70 has the wow factor with Japanese reliability to boot!
Offended that a Brummie ignores the two British competitors (Velar and F-Pace - both built in the Midlands) and only compares to more of zee jermans offerings.
you should review the new glc
He truly hates the fake exhaust
Does the SQ5 have fake exhaust tips?
Boys lemme just make it clear that Nissan GTR R35 has been officially discontinued from today 
"i hope mat mentions his height when sitting in the back because i am 6,6   278 pounds and i wanna know if i fit there or not "
Anyone that hasn't reviewed the sf90 stradale is not a real auto journalist.
Can you guys do a review for the new Mazda cx-5 please ?
Finally! I've beeenn waiting for this review.
Best car!
"Does anyone actually care if their tail lights’ are led, regular bulbs, or o led? Car makers trying to make insignificant things “cool” and charge you for them"
thanks to ALFA ROMEO for donating that alluminium bottle ...im sure they'll give Matt the  STELVIO QUADRIFOGLIO to to review soon.
Best intro by far... 
What is the edition one in the U.S?  DOES IT COME WITH PAINTED BRAKE CALIPERS?
Till now Mat says pop up banners more than anything else!
"I would very like if you can do the worst sport cars drag race exemple: Nissan Micra, Toyota yaris, Subaru Legacy..."
"Matt: Q5 better than BMW
Everyone: Such BSSSSSS"
That’s a great intro Matt
Matt we are not all obsessed with phones the only reason I have one is to ring a taxi to get back from the Pub.
"Just ordered X3 M40i ,can't say no to B58 engine"
"Could you fit 3 kids with a combination of a booster and 2 child seats? If yes how comfortable it would be, especially the middle one?"
Any chance you could do the Audi sq5
Best !!! 1st respect 
"Please review geely tugella and geely coolray
Or lynk&co I would be so interested to watch "
I LOVE IT!
Some folks may interested to note that the Q5 is now made in Mexico.
I like the way how I see every car review with such excitement like after this video i'll go straight to carwow and pick a deal and buy a car lol . Btw i like mat watson 
Can you please do a 2021 q2 and q3 review
I saw your girlfriend driving the Jimny the other day on Chelsea Bridge! It's MY70 JMY right?
It looks exactly the same as before
Love it
So how do you really feel about the boot?
Looks really good
Do a test to the old(er) Land rover discovery vs the new land rover discovery!
Anyone still asking for the running race needs to leave this channel.
It’s a idea to show us how you review a car?   So show us your first impression of a new car.
Looks really pretty.
The old car looked better to me
"If you want to buy good SUV that is fun to drive well equipped for the price, buy an Alfa Romeo Stelvio"
"Those 20"" alloys look like 18""!"
Those fake exaust tips are the best looking yet
I was just waiting for Mat to throw the Load Cover in the woods :)
Who thinks they should have James Batchelor and/or Ginny Buckley for a drag race or something
Anyone else watch these videos even though you’ve no intention of buying the car 
3:15 I now know where they got the inspiration for Wallace (and Gromit) from
Can you review the new Peugeot she seems to be really good 
Luxury or no luxury always be proud of your brand and try working to improve. I love luxurious lifestyles. All thanks to crypto I just got my first la Ferrari . My advice to y'all invest in cryptocurrency or gold.
Looks so good
"Matt why don't you test cars on public roads it was actually way better back then, then rather testing it on a track we all don't drive cars on tracks"
Am I the only one who has noticed the Q5 has an engine warning light???
SQ5's and SQ7's I've encountered almost exclusively driven by massive douchbags
looks like Q3 with no change
More of the usual drab design from VW/Audi. It looks then same as every other Audi for the last 20 years. Plus they are unreliable. Love Mats review though.
People complaining about the load floor lift over until it saves them from a jar of pickles that rolled out and shattered on the garage floor. I’ll take the lifting a few inches.
"I want to buy this legendary car right now  
I need a beautiful blonde Canadian American wife"
We had a 2018 model Q5 and it’s so unreliable. Very disappointed
1:56 I have started to believe that Mat was a dog in his previous life :D
Looks smaller than the q3 
Day 1?? of asking for a 1/4 mile sprint race between mat and yianni.
Absolutely love Audi. Audi for life!!
"Did you know........... That 2014 was the last year that Bang & Olufsen had anything to do with the systems marketed under their name from any vehicle manufacturer?
Any B&O Play products and their entire automotive division and the rights to their name was sold to Harmon/JBL (at around that time) and Harmon has been making all the systems across the board and just continued using the branding rights of the B&O name."
Testing an Audi with an Alfa Romeo Waterbottle. Surprise surprise it fits       Anyway Audi won't be happy to see that 
"Bring back the days when ""you"" actually had to pay attention when you are driving and not have a tonne of computers kissing your ass. Fake pipes, fake vents and fake engine noise coming through your speakers. Take a Diabolo or a Countach you had to pay attention or it bit you in the ass and there was nothing fake about that. You'd get more of a driving experience in an old Golf/Rabbit GTI. As a society we let this happen paying more for less. Anyway great upload as ever keep up the good work."
"the holders are not for coins, but for the cards for the navigation system"
"Brand new Audi Q5... Already has an engine check light on. Skip the premium German trash, buy a Toyota."
Mat we are still waiting for the 100m sprint race with yani come on 
"Mat, It's pointless you referring to pop out banners because your editors never put them in.."
Hey when your doing the review can you show us the spare tire? I want to know who is doing spare's and who are cheaping out and doing those stupid repair kits.
"""Vorsprung durch Technik"" is equivalent to ""Lead by Technology"". 
""Vorsprung"" is pronounced like for-sh-prung !
For further references only !"
This is a very nice SUV
WHERE WE AT NOTI GANG
"Problem with Matt's reviews is that he doesn't pay much attention and doesn't go into much more details about the rides and the steering or handling. He is obsessed with interior and keeps saying CD players are bad. Come on man, CD players are the best thing since cassette players! 

All of Matt's reviews seem to be same. Nah dude, you need to up your game a bit."
Congratulations Mat Watson for finding 20 mins of things to say about an impossibly dull car.
Not even close to be better then a X3! 
"I think the patch of road where they test 0-60 is slightly downhill... Think about it, pretty much all the AWD cars tested there gave faster 0-60 times than expected... hmmm"
So? Was it better or worse than the merc and bmw?
That grill is literally bigger than bmw and people complaining over the M4!
"I felt bad for that ""two hours later"" sign not using Sponge Bob Square Pants styling and voiceover"
"Not sure why but I've always found Audis as boring cars. Family members have owned a few audis over the year and the appeal for it, isn't as great for me but each to their own"
"wait i’m confused, when comparing cars why don’t you compare it with the Macan as well?"
"5 things I dislike about Carwow
1. Constant mention of popout banners
2. Mat plugging his channel
3. The amount of times you are asked to click on Carwow website be it the trusted dealers waffle or the best price and spec according to Mat but he won’t tell you, you have to visit the Carwow website.
4. Mat’s showing off drifting constantly when no need.
5. The same old tired format of reviewing the car, please change it up a little. 

5 things I like about Carwow
1. The drag races with Yianni
2. The latest models can be seen almost as soon as they come out.
3. Daily uploads
4. Its free to watch
5. Im struggling "
This cameo from the cameraman at 9.23 ahahah :D
"Fellas, Carwow is one of the premiere auto channels on the 'Tube. Can we work on the audio quality? Matt's voice in this vid is boomy, round and hard to understand. There is just this boomy ball of voice with indistinguishable words blended all together. I gave up about of a 1/4 of the way through.

( I watch on browser on a Macbook plugged into a large TV )"
"The cupholders are covered until you need them, but then you still have a useless armrest. So you have to choose if you want your cups held or your arm rested...

Why is it so difficult for car makers to just put the cupholders in front of the armrest...?"
"I want to buy this legendary car right now  
I need a beautiful blonde Canadian American wife"
We want to see the BMW m5 evolve with the 1000hp race a Ducati
Nice cod piece.
Dont think mat would take 2 hours to find that log of truth.. What was he doing there that much of time?
Perfect Amazing Fantastic Exelent Magical ️️️️️️️️️️️
13:26 got me dead 
"Can’t understand why they haven’t updated the insides so it’s like the Q7? 
It looks soooo dated."
"Ezekiel 36:23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes./inspiration+God is holy, His name is great, and He is good. At times, He is profaned by those who claim to follow Him but do not act in His will. They do evil and say it is His will when it is not. God will not let His name remain profaned. He will make unbelievers know that He is God and that He is good. Maybe you know someone who drags God’s name through the mud. That can be frustrating and even infuriating to watch. Take heart. God is mightier than them. He will make Himself known. /prayer+ LORD, You are mighty and good. You will make Your character known. Show Your might to the nations. Make unbelievers tremble at the knowledge of You. Show them You are God. You have the power to do anything. Let Your will be done. Let men bow before You and know that You are God. I have heard of Your mighty works, and I have seen some of Your mighty works firsthand. Act mightily in Your creation. In Jesus’ name. Amen."
"C'mon, the review of the glc is from 2016, do the review of the new version please"
"I am astounded that Audi has a entertainment system stuck on top of the dashboard like an afterthought. It is horrible, it looks lazy as if they couldnt be bothered to redesign the dashboard to incorporate it in a more elegant way. If I could afford it I still wouldnt buy it because of that. Shame on you Audi."
This q5 kinda looks like a lifted passat
Please do a dragrace with Audi TTRS and Mercedes Benz AMG A45s
Can you do the 2021 SQ5 then?
Finally... the same tail lights as on my phone
Oh.. I forgot to mention in the Seat Cupra vid’s comments: you forgot to see if it’s rear windows went down all the way.
who else watches Matt regularly?
How come Vw has a diesel offering in Europe but not for India.
"Those small cubbies in the center console are so annoyingly pointless in an otherwise beautiful interior. Surely, they could've put better cupholders in front of the gear lever instead of that tiny storage. Also, the placement of those cupholders doesn't seem very ergonomic; too close to the driver and passenger's elbows!!"
Those slots in the glove box are for SD cards btw
"Why are Audis only compared to MBs and BMWs?  In this threesome, ... the Porsche Macan would seem to be the obvious choice."
I wanna see the review of the q7
Although I am German I am sure it must be named 'electric tailgate'!
Is it 550 liter in boot or 520???
Just bought one 
It's like the new Q3
4:23 brand new car has the check engine light on already 
That’s chrome lip in the boot stops things from just rolling out if you’re part winding up a hill
"The Audi Q5 looks the same for 15 years now....


It’s Audi’s 911"
Basically a slightly de tuned s3 in a q5 offt send it over to tuners be rapid
0-60 tests look like they’re going down hill 
Why doesn't this have the new Audi interiors? The dual screen setup.
GLC looks biggest.
I was in a  2020 Audi a1 my misses was drive down the moterway about  100 mph lane assist kicked in we ended up getting pulled into the hard shoulder from the fast lane  lucky it was late there was no cars about   we deffo would have got fucked up if the was
"For Sale: ""a press review car by CarWow""

Slightly driven and was handled with CARE by Mat Watson from Carwow. "
Who was able to see the cameraman when they were moving to the boot 9:25
Is it just me or does it look like a 2021 Q7 from the back?
"I guess you should avoid the exhaust test.. I mean put a dead branch in the exhaust pipe. I know you're doing some humour but it's ridiculous bro..
Nevertheless awesome video and nice car. I love Audi."
Please do an in-depth review on the Lamborghini urus
But i think the previous one was good ..!!
"Alfa Romeo bottle, I guess its cap is already broken "
We need comparisons 
Can you do a review on a mini hatch or mini clubman or countryman or jcw
At the rate Audi is going we're going to end up with a fake steering wheel!
Can you please review the new Q2
The audi badge on the side looks like something a Polish chap would put on his 19 year old A4 1.9tdi
I have owned 2 Audi Q5’s a 3.0 TDI and SQ5 TDI.With the now fake front and rear exhaust I won’t be buying Audi Q5 on my next purchase
"I like your reviews but your GLC review is of the 2016 car. All you did was change the title to 2020... A little disappointing that you are still referring to it. 
Please make a update or stop referring to it. Im planing to buy a GLC, so yes for me the refresh and details are important."
Q5 for me
Why do Audi's rear Windows not go fully down
"Ok now I have to say this. On most videos you say something about the rear windows, they either go all the way down and that is the best thing or they don't go and its one of the worst things. I have to say who ever puts the windows down to look out ? it makes no sense and in my opinion is totally irrelevant to the review"
9:25 and here you've got a nice view of our camera man
Meet the new Audi..... same as the old one
Whenever I see Mercedes GLC I just think 'Great London Council' and Ken Livingstone (one for the teenagers)!
Lovely on the inside apart from the useless storage but so very very dull on the outside
"So basically they ruined the interior by removing all the good stuff and by adding more useless fiddly stuff. Surprise, surprise!"
Can you please review Volvo XC 40 & XC 60.
Can u guys do cheap suv cars for teens
This or the BMW X3?
It’s better looking then the Mercedes and the x3
"Just because for the fake exhaust I can’t look at it no longer , WHY IN HELL"
That German accent!!! :)
What is the problem about sun roof. It's slow but at least it's not noisy
2:42 some gap there between the carbon parts.....quality nevers stops going down
Damn thats a thicc Volkswagen
"Matt, whats an Alpha Romeo doing in an Audi? Got it?"
"Seriously? The headlights already fogging up on the new car? Vorsprung durch cost options... Do I need to pay extra, to get ones that do not fog up?"
"If u think the X3 looks better, how does it feel to be blind?"
Any chance of a 2021 Leon Cupra review ??
I like the Audi the best
review the facelifted glc pls
"Is it really a new car, or face lift? If it's new, born dead, and far behind the rivals."
The fake exhausts don't do it for me
what a coincidence.. my uncle just yesterday sold his q5
The Porsche Macan really toned down
Looks exactly like a toureg from the back
️ it
"Oh dear, what has Audi done to the front grill??"
"9:37 Dew it, dew it!"
I think the glc is better
I don't like the design it now looks like the q3. The pre facelift was so much better
"audi: yhea itl do 6.1 seconds.
Matt on a wet road: 5.5 secs"
Can we see the review of the new glc
Audi q5 or lexus rx. Reliability aside
"I HATE THE NEW DRL design, and the grill looks so stupid with that shiny black plastic and vertical chrome strips. The ore-refresh looks so much better. I’ve seen several of these new Q5s and literally think they’re Q3s every time because they look so dumpy from the front now"
"But can you use the wireless charging and apple car or Android auto?

BMW has those systems wireless but a lot of the VW group don't."
Please can you review 21 plate Q3. I ordered mine i want you  to review it pls
Q5 should be compared to GLE or X5.
"""I am Mat Watson and this is carwow"" "
If you’re watching this video I hope you get this car and achieve all of your dreams
AN ALFA ROMEO FLASK....THATS MATT WATSON STYLE...
Wow mat saw my comment on being bloody consistent with the parcel shelf
Is very nice car I have sq5 4 l. Am Happy
Vote for Matt to do a bmw 2series gran tourer
You have a steering wheel on a wrong side. That's the 1st issue.
those allow rims aren't new ...we've seen them on the rs6 ....
Do a drag race with a scion frs or toyota gt86 or subaru brz against a car jou can pick or do a drag race with a abarth
12:15 Very typical for VW Group cars.
“This engine strong” Ape approves
Hope there is a delete for those rings.
Where are the tail lights when u opened the boot? Good luck doing that on the side of the road with a bit of a dark.
"I dont know why but it feels a lot like mercedes gla review. For what it is amd what it costs, it seems impractical, inside looks crowded and overall design is ok at best. The hell...?"
My phone has OLED tail lights?! WTF?! 
"Why Audi have you not updated the interior ! The Audi a1 and a3 has it and their cheaper , that horrid screen makes it so dated :("
6:28 Matt doesn’t play around with coins 
those wheels look tiny on the car !
Hey Matt can you make Volkswagen Tiguan allspace r line 2020 review video 
"Matt yeeted the car cover!! But FR mine was missing, could you tell me where your three that one?!"
Why does it look like a GLC? 
Hello.  Mat please review the 2021 Urus
Is it just me or from front it looks like a mini URUS ?
"„Better than a....?“
Well..Is it,Matt?"
I dun mind some scratches on my parcel shelf .... atleast m gonna get a big discount 
"As Audi announced it won't develop new ICE engines - is the new 2,0 ltr diesel with aluminium block its last ever newly designed ENGINE (as opposed to motor)? Like how audi has the last word regarding diesel. Come on, polar bears, care for an ice cream? Well done."
"Hey mat, I noticed at 7:11 your OCD kicked in as you needed to straighten the 12v plug "
is there really reason why fake exhaust are so popular among car manufacturers ?
Can u do a drag race with a subaru wrx STI. Please
What tires are you driving on ?
The link to the GLC review is from 2016 but the video title says 2020! 
Would rather have a new shape Tucson the q5 is looking very dated now
car looks just the same as the first q5 that cameout 15j ago
You didnt answer the question.. is it better than BMW or Mercedes?
The bottom of the doors are misaligned at 2:40.
on looks better than the bm
When they are gonna do İnterior like Q7 or Q8?
those cubby holes are for your C90 cassettes.
"4:16 not even a 1000 miles on the clock, and already a check engine light..."
honestly what is the point of fake exhaust instead of designing a cool rear bumper without them??? Sure the ENGINEERS can figure something out come on!!
Test the new GLC
"Rivals:BMW X3 M Competition,Mercedes GLC 63 or Tesla Model Y"
Am I the only one that saw the check engine at 4:17
Its mostly the same car underneath as the one from 2008! Con
"Hang about, I'm sure I'm a berk for asking this but as a yank.. no  chance whatsoever of getting this discount on a USA purchased Audi I'm guessing?"
Proved my theory that the new Tucson is better than this.
I know who Matt reminds me of at times Frank Spencer
"Is it just me or is Mat a little agitated here, lol."
The front end actually looks worse than the previous model.
13:26 Clever German accent 
"ipad stuck on a dash is from like a decade ago ... just not good enough anymore, bring the next gen asap please"
Please do a Drag Race with the new BMW m4/3

why would a car need oled taillights...?
Please review new sorento 
Is new f pace video any soon?? 
"Dear cartoon, please review BMW X3 M40i"
"Sorry but have to ask.
Why is the check engine light in on?"
"Sold my 2021 q5 Sline after 6 months. Rubbish quality control from Mexico. Paint had blemish, brake clunking, and Dealer couldnt fix MMI problem as car has been offline for 3 months. Aweful customer service. Ordered an LCI x3 m sport."
"Matt: ""Bit of a thick rear pillar"" 
Me: ""Huh, A bit of a thick rear pill**k"""
Love from India ️
I didnt like the way Mat was treating the parcell shell...
Do a Q7 plz
Great review!! But you're driving on the wrong side of the Road!
Can u review the new c class please
No one talking bout the check engine light on the dash
Mat's got cake!
Cant wait to watch plus it's a Audi so....
Did he do a review of the SQ5?
my new  Audi q5 2020 stay for 70 days broken with a gear problem  !!
Upgrade = Price Hike.
how many years does Audi want to sell this old car ??
These cars aren’t what they used to be 
this car shouldn't be shortlisted Matt
Matt & Yanni running race!
Do 3rd to 5th gen RAV4 race
Nice car ٠
matt have you see the new mercedes eqs interio
I have not seen a video on the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 S 4MATIC+ Coupé from you yet.
Can you do a Dodge Challenger review
Do a drag race diesel vs petrol
Review the new MG range
Can't stand those dashtop screens. I think Mazda started this trend because it's cheaper to engineer than incorporating them into the dash.
My dad have this car nice auto
Mat....walks like mr bean
"A blind man put that Audi badge on the bottom of the rear door.

Also, what is up with these super high placed infotainment screens that create such little viewing space between the rear view and the screen out the windshield? Seems intrusive."
Wow Car!
9:25 you can seen cameraman
Matt waiting for 2021 BMW 6 Series Review

I love the jokes about german people:)))))))
"Can someone explain why on earth black trim costs more than silver? Why, Audi?"
*0-62mph in 6.1s
I see now Audi is leading the fake exhaust race by miles.
Why do they put fake exhaust on the updated car that makes no sense to me whatsoever
"I don't believe in this ""specialist timing gear"""
I was laughing so hard
They really still going with the stuck on screen design it looks horrific
we can finally see the cameraman: 9:25
Cool car
Everything on Audi is an extra option. BMW and Mercedes give more as standard.
That Audi logo on the side is probably the most out of place thing I have seen on a car.
do a review of the new kia sorento
Q5  vs ID4  vs Model Y?  Which car I should buy?
"7:20 shoes on the seat, that's a paddlin' for sure"

Please give me that Alfa water bottle
You’ve got to love German lying. 
5:42 that’s for you key
Mark Goldbridge. But in a different field
Audio is muffled 
Am i the only one who does not use Android auto or Apple Carplay?? I mean the systems on Audis BMWs and Mercedeses are just great and with bluetooth you have everything you need
The Q5 is getting a bit boring now... It needs a total redesign. Also those lower lights on the bumper are not using LEDs... Come on Audi It's 2021. But Matt's German accent is impeccable 
"14:15 ""This is the voice of the Mysterons..."""
"Hi Mat, I would pay you to converse with me with that German accent ️"
"Very cheap way to make a ""New car"" Audi. I dont see whats so so New about this in comparison too a3 of even a1"

When are you doing a review of the new ford kuga
plz do a stationery sound check. People who want this plz like!!!
Remote start?
The boot review section reminded me the before clips of a cheesy infomercial.
Fakery at the front as well as the back?... This is the Nicki Minaj of the car world... 
steering wheel on the wrong side...
The Q5 is inthe same class as the BMW X5.They are cheating.

By far the worst looking in the segment. Audi needs to step up their exterior design game. Simplify & modernize! I know it's hard but they for sure have the manpower and the talent for it!
13:25 I am dead man
Worse than GLB. GLC is on another level.

I put rotten fruit in the boot of my Leon. Call that the new Cupra Fermenter
matt wash your hands before you touch all over the interior!
Bring the alfa romeo gulia gta
Audi's interiors are so lack luster.
4:07 The infotainment screen position makes the interior looks so UGLY :(
When are u ganna do the buggatie
U should compare this one to the x5 instead of the x3
"Video uploaded 1 min ago and already filled with comments ""good video, dewd"". Really? I bet you havent even finished the commercials on the video"
Alfa Stelvio
who else saw the camera man?!
"Sorry Audi, just stupid to make the system only touch screen. I drive the 2018 Audi A4 which had the same interior then the pre facelift Q5 and the system is much more easy to use and more important safe. I never need to streech my had. What where you thinking Audi. For that I would never upgrade to only touch screen since I just hate it."
I wonder who has high speed wifi now
YES 
Q8
Sofyan > Mat at all level
Pls GLC 2021
13:24 There is a guy in America asking the same question... WTF guy?

Jobbie coloured shoes  
I have sq5
Baby Volkswagen Touareg
Are you alright Matt?
He was in the woods a long time..... me thinks he met a bear.....  
Does this @carwow guy know that the pop-up on top of the video doesn't exist anymore?
This and its competition look so 2010.
"I can’t stand the placement of the centre  screens, so dated and lazy."
Pity about the outdated interior. Would rather buy a larger Korean SUV
one word for the man doing the review!!! TWERP!
The Audi black stuck on sign on the rear door looks cheap and is totally not needed
Good videos the chilean 🇨🇱
13:26 funny german accent
Shame that german car designers sticking ipads on dash.
Audi Suv's look as good as Tucson XD
Watched this video a minute after uploading
odd take maybe but i think android auto and carplay suck and never use either. Its just a faff to get going and adds nothing of interest hence infotainment are important to me.
9:25 hi cameraman 
He said track and didn't get a kick in the bottom. Someone is sleeping on their job.. this is a painfully average car
Really struggling with the length of your scarf Mat ;)
Is just really dislike the headlights and the fakery
"Anyone else think the infotainment screen in the middle looks absolutely shit?
I hate it when car makers just put screens onto their dash and don't like mould it into the dash"
"Matt. You plug your phone in but A LOT of people, like me don’t. Stop going on about what you do and review the system."
Not even close to be as good as a Mercedes
"So sick of the fake pipes comment ,  its not about you its about the car"
9:25 not sure that how you wear a mask buddy
"5 annoying things in Carwow are usually a western world upper class problems.. ""Oh my.. The window on my back door doesn't slide all the way down"".. ""Air suspension is a grand extra.. What will I do?"".. Try paying that grand extra, you already have 50 000 pounds to buy this car, 1000 here or there won't make a difference. 
Sometimes I wish for a WW3, just to remind the fat rich people from the West what a true hardship looks like.. I bet you a million that a post WW2 greatest generation wouldn't consider a booth lip to be a problem... A year in a concentration camp yes. But a booth lip, definitely not a problem."
Too much acting and scripted /planned jokes in this :(
I find him very attractive
3:39 Who the fuck cares??? It looks cool
The question is: “who the hell gives a damn about it?”
drag race??
"Have never liked the Q5, just don’t know what is it about it"
Why o why still the fake exhaust....????
Its not better than a Mercedes glc
Great car. Just hate the tablet design for infotainment screen. Lazy engineers.
Pre Facelift was much better in looks compared to this Facelift Audi
All Audi Cars look similar.
What was the website again? VehicleWoah?
"So Mat, you are moaning about the rear lights switching location?  You scared the alien space ship wont see them while they are poking up in the air?   Its an excellent clever feature, get a grip or you will get the stick of truth you know where."
"Just buy a 2013 Q5.
Same junk"
interior looks so old......
Are people still buying ICE cars? It's so last century...
"Matt, why  are you so obsessed   about fake exhausts and stupid stick of truth ??  for my taste on this q5 it looks fine ..."
Carbon sideskirts with fake exhaust pipes???????wtf Audi....
It says HELP ME CARWOW INDIA??
try not to use question mark. every video with a question mark
"Is Matt married?
Becoz he look father of two children"
And people want cars like Tesla . Tesla only advantage is acceleration and milage for electric car .
Finally
saw your cameraman 9:25
That Beetle like back is extra ugly. 
"Fake Contest:
BMW Supra OR Audi Q5"
Old looking car for 2021.
"Matt, no one uses Android Auto or Apple CarPlay except for car journalists and a few people"
Should you avoid..... yawn just jump to the .... you should shortlist routine
We can make a collab video pls give permission

Yikes! Audi.

To many ads... so in quit looking 
Bloody L!!!
"No to Audi, again."
"I had an Audi with a 3.0L TDI engine, done 180,000 km. It cost nearly $5k NZ$ to replace the timing chains and tensioners. What a pile of crap they are. Never buy an Audi."
Your scarf is too long. Looks weird under your coat
I’d never replace my GLC Coupe with one of these. This is ugly.

these facelifted headlights are insanely ugly. prerefresh is better in almost every way
"Compared to the other SUVs of this segment, this just looks boring. Very good car, but not exciting at all"
"Carwow is rubbish. The ""offers"" are more expensive than real offers in the market."
Apple car play is  why are motor journalists obsessed with it
"Audi aren't making some safety features standard ?️ and did he say plug your phone in ? Wtf audi with how expensive this cars , they couldn't make Android auto  wireless connection . Waste of money to buy this SUV . Give me a top of the line Kia Telluride"
무야호~
Interior is so blunt and boring

Another SUV 
"""This"" - Mat stealing from Doug?"
hey mat....
"Still got that dated, stuck-on screen. Yuk!"
"Literally everyone:
Ewww, look at the new BMWs, its so ugly because of that big kidneys!
Meanwhile Audi:
*the grille all around the front + some fake vents and exhausts... People: hmm looks good

What the hell is wrong with you guys?"
Hate the audi infotainment sticks out like a soar thumb
Facelifted and still Looks like sh...
"Not fast, economical, beautiful. Just expensive, so well suited for the average wannabe."
Looks dated..
"Audi wasting money and charging for fake exhausts, what a massive insult to their customers. Audi designers have become incredibly lazy,  why all the fakery ?????"
Audi design looking awfully bland and samey throughout the whole range
This is not new at all

Those black trims make the car look so ugly

Warum machst Du das Matt?"
oh god... the blandest suv there is
I’m American EnglishCan you speak American English instead of British
"Every Audi interior looks like cheap plastic, maybe it's not but sucks to look at"
This is Kahwaoh
"I absolutely hate my 2019 Q5 quattro system. The quattro system fails every time when driving on snow and ice. So I drive it in off-road mode during winter and comfort mode in Summer. These cars are never meant for Canadian road conditions.  I'll never buy an Audi again. It isn't a premium car anymore. I wish they go back to the Torsen differential and ditch Haldex. Stay away from quattro system, Canadians. It's not a full time AWD car anymore."
"Damm audi is so bad in the interior.
It look likes an audi from 2012
Audi don't go back the past we want future.
Very Very sad "
9:25 Hello Jack

This ugly panel they bought from Apple store?
disliking the video thanks to the orgy of ads.
"I lost my job during the Pandemic.     

I created my channel believing for MYSELF, YOU and the rest of the WORLD"
"The Q5 is such an ugly SUV compared to the Q7, why couldn't they have made it more similar to the Q7? Just smaller."
The car look soooo boring
"This car looks like it's from 2017.
Boring af"
"Even with facelift, q5 looks kinda dated. Its my least favourite out of Audi's suvs, even though i love audis."
"That's a car or a shoe box .... It is VERY boring to watch, but I imagine the driving is correct and good. But I wouldn't buy it."
I'm watching here and thinking 'why are Audi sending cars to him so he can throw the parcel cover on the ground'. It's so childish and destructive.
Hello mat how are u doing
Bet u won't heart me
Yeah huge huge huge huge yes fake exhaust I mean What on earth Audi terrible we just look at those is horrible
Audis look totally bland and boring.

"First Comment from me guys like me

The Q5 is trash
Mercedes makes the most boring cars under 100 thousand pounds
Awful old average design!
Great... another horrid SUV
"I’m the Second one 
Like my comment “Mat”"
"Help me carwow for a free cheap car, I have no car , I see since Car buyer"
Absolutely hideous design
This is how it looks when AUDI driver makes a AUDI review . The Q5 was always looking strange. There is nothing what looks good on it. AUDI Cannot do SUV design. RS6 is beautiful but SUV terrible.  only a high prices VW. Sorry for AUDI but its so
As dull as ever this car.

"Please stop this “CarWow Stick of Truth” bullshit, you’re literally scratching up a brand new car for no reason! It’s not funny or even useful information!"
"£40k + for that, Audi must be laughing. 
Can we please review something more exciting than Eurobox mini SUVs with 2 litre engines."
I don’t like it’s design. It’s so ugly
"Why does Mat Watson always throws things around in the review cars, and handle the car controls so roughly? Man what do you want to prove with such arrogance? And what's that ugly habit of checking fake exhaust with dirty tree branches? Sheer arrogance :("

This car is damn boring. Sorry
Why is this guy always such a drama queen?! They should name the channel: Karen Reviews!
It's an overpriced  VW Tiguan.
"audi is lame, cold and without any emotion!"
All German cars are dreadful.
