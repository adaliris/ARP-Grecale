JPOnstwedder,A Maserati should be elegant and stylish. This thing is frumpy and even by today’s low standards the interior looks a total mess. Pass.,"April 02, 2022"
southerndriver,Until we see the pricing any comparison with the Macan is a difficult call. The Macan is a brilliant vehicle and will be tough for the Maserati to come close but as I own one I'm biased.From a financial point of view I would expect the Macan to walk all over the Grecale when comparing resale values.Edited by southerndriver on Saturday 2nd April 16:07,"April 02, 2022"

anonymous-user,"A four pot soft roader Maserati. What wonderful treats will they find for car enthusiasts next, perhaps a Facel Vega that's a rebadged Chevrolet, or a 3 pot diesel Ford Kuga badged as a GT40?This car has nothing going for it except a badge, a badge which it devalues by existing.","April 02, 2022"
noble12345,Who is the designer?Someone who wanted to make Miss Piggy and Jabba the Hutts lovechild by the looks of it and that interior is so dated.The MC20 thing looks a bit st too tbh the interior looks cheap and those covered back lights are awfull esp when dirty.Shame as i wanted Maserati to do well.,"April 02, 2022"

Nicolas Lazar,"So they acknowledge having issues with the market positioning of the Levante. But instead of working on it and try to move it up, they offer a new one - lower. Makes total sense.

Pontus88,"It's fairly clear that you can obtain the majority of the pro's of a SUV from an estate without some of the cons.It would be refreshing if a company such as Maserati could produce a type of spacious 'estate like car', or something along that theme. Losing the bulk, the 22inch plus wheels, the blobby brick profile, gaping plastic grilles and largely redundant 4wd systems along the way. Maybe the designers and engineers could be asked to be innovative? Rather than follow the market, they might create a new market, they might lead rather than follow. Porsche got there early, and fair play to them for seeing the gap. Now we are seeing multiple marks eyeing up the returns and pile in (better late than never?) to this increasingly saturated market. Hopefully we'll see the inevitable slow death of this segment soon, but we need another innovative company to make the first move...","April 02, 2022"

In the EV space, which, like it or not, that's where we're all going, I think they'll be bigger players than they are now. Quality will be key, given that the emotiveness around combustion engines will disappear. And no one does quality like Lexus.

ducnick,"With these sorts of cars I wish the reviewers would essentially ignore the halo model bought by the 1%.What we seem to have is a 2 litre, fairly dull small suv just like all the other 2l dull SUV’s. I can’t imagine the vw Tiguan or Audi Q5 /bmw x3/Merc /jag etc etc is any better or worse when it comes to the dull powertrain. They are all dull because they are boring 2 litre four bangers in a brick outhouse.So move onto the other differentiating factors.Is the interior better or worse than the competition? Well it sounds pretty infuriating to me from the review. Certainly no match for proper door handles and buttons in a bmw, but probably about average for the market sector.How about the exterior styling? It looks to me like a big ford kuga with some Maserati badges. The whole thing looks very transverse front wheel drive with a cab forward design. Probably good for interior space, but it’s not a good looker to me.Price? I bet that will be competitive.Dealer experience/reliability … it’s a maserati, when I had one you wouldn’t venture near Britains only dealer, but I’m sure they must have improved now. In the PCP world this probably isn’t a factor.It’s going to be a very hard sell in a market dominated by German brands with wide dealer networks and big advertising budgets. I personally can’t see it doing well in the U.K.","April 02, 2022"

DeltaEvo2,"The design is fine, the majority of people who buy this type of car don't really buy it for its looks, more for the interior and how many displays it's got. Never understood that. Out of all the SUVs I would probably get a Stelvio Quadrifoglio or a Levante Trofeo if I had the money. People talking about the headlights, the very first time I saw them designed like that were on the Fiat Punto and Maserati 3200, both designed by Giugiaro and that is decades before the Puma or Macan.","April 02, 2022"
Joeogilvie,"I traded from a Macan to a new StelvioQF last summer - there’s no question as to the better interior quality and sense of solidity in the Macan, but the StelvioQF masks it’s weight far better, and even compared to the more sporty cars in my garage, is fun to drive.The Macan has extremely high residuals, and probably presents the most economic option, but the standard kit on a StelvioQF is impressive and you don’t have to spend big on options - that’s not always taken into account when Macan residuals are being discussed.I considered a Levante, but it was too dated and dynamically weak compared to the StelvioQF, though it’s hard not to find the brand appealing.

UKTrofeo,One other point to note is that the screws that Maserati supplies to fix the rear number plate to the rear plate holder are too long and therefore go into the paintwork causing damage. This was spotted by my ppf installer and fully rectified by my dealer free of charge. The dealer checked their other Grecales and ALL of them had damaged paintwork as a result of the long screws. Once rectified and the ppf installed I binned the rear number plate holder and just installed the rear number plate with thick double sided sticky foam pads.

Leaving the Security Fob in a coat pocket placed on the rear seat or in wife’s handbag, triggered alerts and phone calls.Vodafone got quite annoyed and said take it out of the leather Maserati pouch - we ignored this. But started placing the Key + Fob in the central cup-holder, which stopped the alerts.Dealer said it shouldn’t be an issue leaving the Fob in the pouch, so long as it was in the car.Will experiment placing it in ‘other’ places to see if this has been fixed.","April 3, 2023"
edit,"To be honest, if I was you, I will take the car as it is and return for repairs only when the spare parts needed have arrived.Because it is possible for them to have problems in the suply chain, as the model is new and also a niche model. Maybe you will wait another 1 or 2 moths for the spare parts.Back in 2008 I had a brand new model of Audi A4 and hit a dog with it. As the model of the car was new, I had to wait over 1 month for the spare parts to come, as it was difficult for them to supply. And it wasnt a niche model and it wasnt the times we are living today.My 2 cents.","April 3, 2023"

It did strike me as a bit odd when the article said (basically) - 'It's £58.5k, which is a lot, but it's ok because it's actually £14k and £566 a month'. So a bit over £34k to drive a not-particularly-attractive 4-pot SUV with a list price of £58k for 3 years...that still seems quite a lot. And it's 'only' about as quick as the X3 30d I've been considering, which isn't a performance SUV as such. I suppose if the Maserati badge means a lot to you then it may make sense, but it doesn't to me.Edit: in fairness on re-reading it the article isn't implying that the cost via PCP is ok, if anything it studiously avoids saying anything one way or the other!

It was watered down and did not drive neatly as well, the facelift car has different suspension components, no carbon roof as standard etc etc. They changed the setup to reduce wheel skip when cold, but the facelift was far less satisfying and fun to drive for me. Mine was a 2017 car. Facelift from 2020 in the Alfa.The SVR I ended up with by surprise, I tried a C63S and an F90 M5 and found the Merc disappointing and the M5 just dull. The SVR is a very practical and great everyday car, with good luxury. But the surprising thing is how much character it has, obviously it sounds great, has instant thrust, and the handling is fun and the control inputs nicely weighted. The SVR is such a great all round and fun everyday car, and obviously good in all weathers unlike the Alfa.

UKTrofeo,So potentially some more positive news. My dealer contacted me to say that my car is now progressing quite quickly through the production line - the production line codes have now increased 3 times this week. And the date of delivery has remained at week 3 (ie mid January). The dealer is now pretty confident it will arrive then. We shall see.,"December 23, 2022"
EDZ,"UKTrofeo said:Well I’m trying to be optimistic. The dealer has had a number of GTs and Modenas delivered so are aware of the broad way that the production codes have progressed for cars that they have had delivered recently. If your car has reached production code 50f a while ago then certainly I would be less confident. Mine was on code 20 for months. I’m guessing that right hand drive Trofeos have been a bit of an issue for Maserati hence the delays. However a paint finish issue would affect Modenas and GTs as well. Mine is a different colour to yours. We will see if there are further delays pretty soon!!!Click to expand...Unfortunately my optimism has been knocked several times, but I still smile and hold on to some hope that it will turn up soon. The Trefeo Primaserie is a specialist four coat colour finish under the fluorecie program (according to the price list I have a 15k extra) and not done on normal production line run as other colours listed. The car is pulled from line and painted else where apparently, so does not follow the same line production run schedule as all other cars, hence what I was told last update. As you say will be interesting to see what they say in the new year, my dealer is far more optimistic for the Q1 delivery but will no longer say he is confident. 🤣 All the best, and have a great Christmas.","December 24, 2022"

elchiki,"EDZ said:Welcome to the forum edit.It's been virtually impossible to get discounts on any new cars for the last couple of years, due to supply and demand. Manufactures have been struggling to get parts linked with the semiconductor shortages and just can not produce the amount of cars required for the market. Add to this that the Grecale is a brand new model and orders are buoyant, they have no need to discount, plenty of customers in the queue. You may be lucky and get something thrown in but don't hold your breath  I'm sure as the parts shortage and semi conductor issues slowly subside, linked with the current bad global economy figures, the rise in cost of living and energy costs, demand will ease and maybe a little discount will return, but not for a while yet. IMO, anyone that has got a discount would had been a very, very lucky customer or an employee of the dealer or manufacture  Good luck.Click to expand...Yes, I am right now discussing seriouisly for the purchase of my Grecale and discount are between 10 and 13 %.( 100 % cash payment)","February 1, 2023"

The trouble is that Maserati have been playing me along, each time a delivery date arrives it's not met and I'm given another delivery date which is normally only a few weeks later, so I hold fire as most new cars at present are taking around six months.

Maserati have reluctantly just informed my dealer that all Grecale's were held back at the factory and none were actually dispatched. Apparently they have a software issue and won't release any Grecale's until they have sorted the problem, as it has to be done manually to each car and can't be done over the air, (suggests different parts fix to me) So basically anyone out there waiting for a car from factory will have a delay (so I'm informed), no time scale for this has yet been given. Maserati are obviously playing cloak and dagger and keeping issues hidden as best they can, but obviously there is only a limited time they can hide things especially if no cars are being released from factory.

If you are told delivery time when ordering you accept or reject that time and work to those times, give or take a month. Maserati have not been up front with information or kept me informed from the outset, diabolical customer service and relations and I thought Porsche were bad 🤣The best of this is: I had an email direct from Maserati back in July 2022 welcoming me to the family and informing me my car was in build and should be with me very soon 😱 from then on they went into hiding 👻","February 23, 2023"

I ordered a Trefeo Primaserie launch addition back in March 2022 just after Maserati's world wide launch of the Grecale. Maserati advertising such ""Be the first to own before anyone else"" Yet here I am 11 months on watching standard Trefeo's arriving in the UK over the last couple of months and GT and Modena's arriving since October 2022 and still no Trefeo Primaserie's arrived, also most of the cars that have arrived in the UK were ordered in or after July 2022. I'm currently waiting an update as to current position as yet another delivery date (which makes seven now) has not been met again this week. The actual colour is Giallo Corse in the Fuoriserie programe.RegardsEDZ","January 26, 2023"
UKTrofeo,The interior leather is much darker black but my phone made it look grey! Looks better in person and the red stitching pops.I’ve just had a 90 min drive-very impressed so far. Looking forward to pushing the nettuno a lot more,"January 26, 2023"

UKTrofeo,At last I’ve got it! Only driven it back from the dealer so far. But definitely a thumbs up! Will report more as I drive it. I like the special red detailing on the Trofeo and Maserati badges - matches the brake callipers and stitching.,"January 26, 2023"

EDZ,"edit said:hello everyone?did you get any discounts when you ordered the car?Click to expand...Welcome to the forum edit.It's been virtually impossible to get discounts on any new cars for the last couple of years, due to supply and demand. Manufactures have been struggling to get parts linked with the semiconductor shortages and just can not produce the amount of cars required for the market. Add to this that the Grecale is a brand new model and orders are buoyant, they have no need to discount, plenty of customers in the queue. You may be lucky and get something thrown in but don't hold your breath  I'm sure as the parts shortage and semi conductor issues slowly subside, linked with the current bad global economy figures, the rise in cost of living and energy costs, demand will ease and maybe a little discount will return, but not for a while yet. IMO, anyone that has got a discount would had been a very, very lucky customer or an employee of the dealer or manufacture  Good luck.","January 27, 2023"

EDZ,"Hi AllIv'e been a little hesitant posting updates as Iv'e had eight delivery disappointments so far.This week I have finally had several phone calls from Maserati Italy !! Firstly the car has been found, so Wally has not got it 🤣 It's built and has a VIN number sitting in a warehouse at the factory awaiting dispatch. No Grecale's have left the factory for over six weeks now apparently, all on hold due to updates etc on software. Apparently it is actually illegal for them to release cars knowing they have issues or faults to correct, hence the sudden stop on dispatch over six weeks ago. I'm so far told that release should finally start happening very, very soon and my car should be in the UK by end of March. They have had numerous problems with the paint, parts and building the my car due to it's very top end spec etc. Iv'e had apologies from several people in Maserati and awaiting a final phone call, as to what they intend to do to make up for it and that the car has been released and on route to UK. Lets hope this is the last time and I don't receive more disappointment and it arrives as been told direct from Maserati. 🤞","March 15, 2023"
1stMaserati,Great news @EDZ !!!!!As an aside… What does this all mean for us on the road in a Grecale? Is there a recall wave coming for all of us with software updates? Funnily I was the the dealer today (less than 3 km from home and next to the petrol station I normally use) as I knew the new Granturismo arrived. They did not mention any software recall for delivered cars. As for the Granturismo… easy on the eyes is all I can say!,"March 17, 2023"
1stMaserati,Here is hoping for you!!!!!!,"March 18, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi 1stMaseratiDuring my conversations things I was sort of told were tongue-in-cheek and still a little cloak and dagger as to real reasons, so obviously some can be taken with a pinch of salt. But I was lead to believe that most software updates can be done over the air, that is cars that are on the road, but new cars are not fully livened up until they arrive at the dealers and sold, so require manual update. Basically they told me as little as possible but keep me happy. Cars are now being released and in fact some are now arriving at dealers. I'm lead to believe mine will be at the dealers sometime next week, we will see 🤞","March 18, 2023"

EDZ,"Just had a phone call, 🙃 apparently my car is loaded on transporter and left the factory on its way to UK ""At Last"". So I'm told only 4 Trefeo Primaseries have been made for the UK market, although I already knew there was not going to be more than 10 built for the UK anyway.So as per the phone call from Maserati earlier this month should be at the dealers before the end of March. 🤞","March 24, 2023"

It should only be a 2 to 3 day trip max, that's taking it easy with plenty of stop breaks, but it still has not arrived as of yet at the dealers. I do understand looking at news bulletins that the French are doing their usual protests and blockages of roads and ports etc at present. Apparently over president Macron's increase in pension age law, and the fisherman over EU new rules coming in over fishing nets. So a possibility held up on route due to these.  but anyone's guess really as it's been from day one 🤣 even the dealer and Maserati at the moment have no idea where it is 🤣 🤦‍♂️","March 30, 2023"

My car has many of the key and key beeps issues a lot of others have raised which I have fed into my service center to help resolve the issues and what it does highlight is that it’s a systemic problem rather an isolated problem with my car. It’s been in the service center for 3 weeks now and Maserati are trying to resolve the issues remotely without any luck so far.The number of different issues does show the lack of testing done and I get the impression that Maserati rushed the car out to get ahead of the launch of the new Cayenne and Macan updates.

Last update I had a couple of weeks ago was that my car should arrive early to mid December. But I'm kind of not expecting it till 2023 as the last two dates for delivery given of October and then mid November have come and gone.,"November 22, 2022"

I have just had another update from my dealer and as expected another delay not arriving next week. Thats 5 different delivery dates given over the last five months so far and still no sign of the car, apparently end of December now. I told my dealer only now contact me when the car has left the factory and on it's way or when it is at your dealership, as I will just take it the car will be here sometime in 2023.","November 25, 2022"

EDZ,"Another slap in the face today. Just had call from my dealer and the car is again delayed and will now apparently not be here until mid December earliest, might as well have said not until 2023. 🤨 Apparently build delay's mainly on right hand drive cars as far as I'm aware, yet I was told the car went into build beginning of August !!! someone is not telling the truth...............🙄","November 3, 2022"
Modenacanada,Same here. Got a call from my Canadian dealership. Was intitially told October. Now they are telling me mid to late December. It seems like 2023.....,"November 4, 2022"
EDZ,"Thanks for the reply ""Modenacanada"" So obviously not just right hand drive cars delayed. I'm sure they will turn up eventually and yes I'm thinking 2023.","November 5, 2022"
