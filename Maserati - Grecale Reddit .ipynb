      "Comment by armanddd: While it's not the ugliest of these SUVs, the fact that it's so similar to the MC20 feels jarring. It's one thing to want consistency of the design language within a brand, it's another to just copy and paste elements, especially from completely different body types. The Aston SUV suffers from the same issue IMO, basically copying the Vantage front and back onto a SUV body. The Urus too, though to a lesser extent. Something about the whole proportions and lines feel a bit wrong and disjointed as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure if it comes from the business side or design side to want such similarities but I wish they would put a bit more effort into designing a SUV as a SUV from the ground up at least. The Stelvio does this fairly well IMO, which is ironic as this is based on the same platform.\n",

It's the Audi S1 or Citroën DS 3 Performance that America never got, but it will exist and continue to exist on the US market because Stellantis marketing will convince everyone it's a compact SUV. I drive a Honda Fit because it's nice inside, can park anywhere, rides and handles great, has rock solid fit-and-finish, feels peppy, and is incredibly roomy. It's a good car, that costs appropriately a little more, in a class where everything else is built to be the cheapest car possible. And it was discontinued because few Americans except me want a subcompact hatchback for reasons other than poverty. My dream car is an Audi S1, but if/when I ever have the disposable income I'm getting me a Grecale, assuming the reliability isn't undriveably nightmarish.\n",

Now I'm excited every (infrequent) occasion I'm lucky enough to take mine out for a trip. Being a hatch it's also pretty easy to lay down the back seat and transport larger items. It's practical but tourqie enough to be a lot of fun. No one ever expects it to be as quick as it is (for its era) because it just looks like a regular golf.

They are far too dangerous and autonomous ones are getting close enough that they're probably going to be safer very soon anyway.\n",

This immediately looked like a Porsche to me but the body has been definitely been modified and it’s probably wrapped.

However, if your financing is over 1.9%, I'd look elsewhere for financing.  Mine is currently in the shop and while I was used to Mercedes maintenance since 2016 and also had an SLK that was a literal money pit (spent $10k and drove 11k miles),  I'm a bit shocked at Jaguar parts and labor costs.  There are even less qualified techs who work on Jags and that helps raise the costs.  That's said, Jaguar still seems to make interiors with quality materials.  MB feels like things are cheaply laminated.  I'm through with MB and BMW. I'm now looking at Lincoln and Jaguar.  Weird pairing, but...\n",

Polestar 2's [SPA platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Scalable_Product_Architecture_platform) dates all the way back to 2011 — before the Model S was even released — and the focus was on *hybridization*, not full-on electrification. \n",
