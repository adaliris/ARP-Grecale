I have a 2021 x3 M40i and the power is addictive but very accessible. The X3M on my test drive was not compatible with commuting due to a super harsh suspension. Audi, MB, and Volvo can’t come close to this combo of power, fuel economy, cargo space and passenger space…plus the infotainment is really great. Exhaust note is also maturing nicely over time. Interesting to note that the highway mph actually went down with the mild hybrid system and the US EPA found no benefit with city mpg. In Ecopro mode this will reliably get 25-27 mpg on the highway at high speed (~75-80mph). I love this car!","

It can deal with deep snow with no problems either, even with the A/S tires (star spec Bridgestones).  It has been super ergonomic, super efficient, and fun for my wife and I.

14,"I have a theory about M; I think BMW is acutely aware of how ""diluted"" M cars have become in the balance between enthusiast driving and daily commuting. Starting with the current M3/4, it looks like they are making M even more hardcore and using the M-sport to satisfy all the people who want a more daily-livable M-car. Ergo the Mx40i cars getting all the badges, the mirrors, and even the special edition M-things like the retro emblem. Also why they are getting way more performant than they have ever been before.","

Ultimately, the M40i drove very well, was better damped and sounded better. The x3/X4M just are not as intense as you’d hope, and when you consider gas/maint/insurance it’s not just a few hundred difference. Don’t forget the engine is tuned more NA on M’s which is frustrating in daily driving. I used to hate these M performance cars after 5 M’s but I put my ego aside and ended up enjoying these. Worth a shot.","

The make such excellent cars in terms of handling, ride quality, engine, technology, interioand exterior quality nd their interiors are really good. And then they fuck up the exterior design sometimes little bit, sometimes a lot. And the thing that frustrates me the most, is that they do it on purpose. Previous gen bmws were some of the most beautiful cars on the road. And its not just that the design is bad, they mess up their design language, desig language the had for years. Example, wanna put an new grill on the 4series, cool, but dont mess up the sidelines, keep the strong, original, bmw like.  The new x3 front and back are just all over the place. the tailights especially, wtf. Same goes for the new 2series coupe, such beautiful and sporty car anfd then the front lights and rear light are rear design are wack. Somebody needs to bring the message to bmw. They have fucked up and need to fix it insteaa of just insisting on their new way just because they cant admitt their shit.","
