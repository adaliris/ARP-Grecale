12gotze,Macan all day,bigdog24681012
12gotze,"Maseratis are pretty to look at, but not own.",Tiny_ChingChong
12gotze,"Personally the Macan is nicer, but the Levante/Stelvio are beautiful if you want something Italian",athleticcdn
12gotze,"The Grecale is an embarrassment. Get a Stelvio if you want an Italian SUV, at least it handles well. Otherwise, get the Macan.",CarolinaRS6
12gotze,I really enjoyed driving the Grecale Modena. No turbo lag. Nice interior and the ride quality was a little softer than the stelvio without sacrificed handling. I was overall pleased. New interior ditches the Harmon Cardon made Chrysler system too. Finally Maserati built a decent vehicle,manbearpig0101
12gotze,"Coming from a person who owned a Macan S for 2 years, switched to a fully specced Grecale Modena a week back, Maserati Grecale is a whole league better than the Macan, the interior, the leg room, the sound quality and the materials, miles ahead of Macan. If want luxury and a quality ride, go for the modena, but if u want performance go for Grecale Trofeo, which is also miles ahead of Macan GTS.",Own-Object1520
12gotze,I had mine couple of weeks back but i saw one grecale on the road today and when i check the engine specs i was amazed. I still love the look of porsche though,paxje
12gotze,"Are you saying this because of resale value?
Just curious",paxje
sv26cf,I'm rocking with anything that will help maserati fund projects like the mc20,NarcoticCow
sv26cf,I honestly would rather spend my money on a MLM then buy this,LongjumpingFormal287
sv26cf,"It's gonna take a lot of deals and quality Testing before I purchase another maserati in My life time. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me",lambo_abdelfattah
sv26cf,How is it a rival? They are made by the same company???,i_drink_petrol
sv26cf,"I feel ya. 

Former Quattroporte owner here. Never again.",dadzcad
sv26cf,"Maserati owned by stellanis, porsche owned by vw owned by porsche family. Math doesnt add up",BuraakGTi10
sv26cf,Shit I might buy a Grecale... whats wrong?,L0L303
sv26cf,"You're 100% correct. I brainfarted badly conflating this with a sub Urus. 

Mea culpa. 

I still wish none of them existed.",i_drink_petrol
10tvt3f,"As much as Iâ€™m starting to really get into and adore Italian cars, the BMW and the Porsche are better value here.",TwinTurbo53
10tvt3f,"M440i X Drive !!!! Fantastic car , powerful engine , controversial design (to me, a statement !)",badbla
10tvt3f,Macan has the best resale and performance. I had the turbo. I miss it every day.,
10tvt3f,You've really gotta go check each one out. They're completely different animals.,JaKr8
10tvt3f,A used GSF or the new rx500h,
10tvt3f,"Beware of the Porsche Macan. My Macan S has endless gear jamming problems and worse, it's in the shop now for 4 weeks due to the moon-roof drain failing and the car flooding. It's a big problem, Porsche should have recalled. The water, over time, not one incident, went down the window pillars and filled up the entire undercarriage. I can hear it beneath me, and see it in the trunk and rear footwells (electronics, insulation etc, all wet). Damage: $9850. Porsche won't help, StateFarm denied the claim. Seriously hope the car blows up, I loathe it.  
My third Porsche, the worst Porsche, my last.",MacanFlooding
tk6rdw,"Hmmm, to me the front lights look reminiscent of the older generation Kia Sportage. Unfortunate.

The rear I think is quite nice and the light design puts me in mind of the Lamborghini Urus.

Not sure what to think of it tbh, it seems to have very limited ground clearance. I'll have to see one in the metal.",Mad4it2
tk6rdw,"Personally, I don't like any of the smaller SUVs out there. With the excellent sales of the Levante, I suppose it makes sense for Maserati to have something in this smaller class.",HOOEY_
