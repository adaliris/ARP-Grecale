tk2qij,I'm all for SUVs meaning just about anything these days but that looks like it has [lower ground clearance than most hatchbacks.](https://images.pistonheads.com/nimg/45464/7.jpg),maxt0r

Yeah OK Maserati, we see what you're doing here.",One_Shekel
tk2qij,"Ahh, they FINALLY said a price. It was rumored to be close to $50k.. which seemed low but I was still hoping it would be true.

> UPDATE: Maserati has shared preliminary US pricing for the 2023 Grecale, which starts at $63,500 for the GT. Available for a short while by making an online reservation, the Modena Limited Edition costs $77,400. Both prices exclude the $1,495 destination and handling fees.

$65k before markup is too much for an underwhelming 2.0l without any Maserati style.",ikadu12

tk2qij,"I'll just go right ahead and say this: This might be an interesting vehicle, but it's not a particularly cool looking one.

It looks like Alfa and Porsche cornered the market on the sporty crossover design, because everything else looks like an imitation.",giddycocks
tk2qij,"While it's not the ugliest of these SUVs, the fact that it's so similar to the MC20 feels jarring. It's one thing to want consistency of the design language within a brand, it's another to just copy and paste elements, especially from completely different body types. The Aston SUV suffers from the same issue IMO, basically copying the Vantage front and back onto a SUV body. The Urus too, though to a lesser extent. Something about the whole proportions and lines feel a bit wrong and disjointed as a result.

Not sure if it comes from the business side or design side to want such similarities but I wish they would put a bit more effort into designing a SUV as a SUV from the ground up at least. The Stelvio does this fairly well IMO, which is ironic as this is based on the same platform.

But maybe I'm wrong and most people like them this way, just my 2 cents.",armanddd

It's the Audi S1 or Citroën DS 3 Performance that America never got, but it will exist and continue to exist on the US market because Stellantis marketing will convince everyone it's a compact SUV. I drive a Honda Fit because it's nice inside, can park anywhere, rides and handles great, has rock solid fit-and-finish, feels peppy, and is incredibly roomy. It's a good car, that costs appropriately a little more, in a class where everything else is built to be the cheapest car possible. And it was discontinued because few Americans except me want a subcompact hatchback for reasons other than poverty.

Hatchback is an iffy. A sedan can technically have it, but the vast majority do not.

I mean, yeah, both have 4wd, but the similarities end there. The Integrale was an old FWD hatch in which they shoved a (relatively) big engine with a permanent 4wd sistem that turned out fantastic for rallying, while the Stelvio is a big SUV on a new, bespoke and extremely good RWD platform.

tk2qij,"your point is taken for the Jag F-Pace and by extension the equivalent Land Rover.  Especially as Maserati wants to be more of a upper class luxury brand, which makes me hesitant to say Audi/BMW/Benz are direct competition (though most definitely competition) despite my earlier post.

Market research paints a picture where Maserati buyers are looking for an alternative to the German brands (and by extension their performance trims). So sure the M Spec, 43 series AMG benz, and S series Audis are competitors but mostly by specs and price.

Genesis is most definitely not a competitor even if the spec/price sheet says otherwise. Even with Maserati's shite reliability and terrible depreciation, the brand name really hampers Genesis from being a real competitor in this space.

So my point really still stand, despite the fact that the market is saturated with SUVs, this particular niche of the market still leaves a lot to be desired.

On a side note. you should be aware the sQ5 feels half class bigger than the Macan which the article paints as the direct competition, it was one of the main selling points for myself as its just a little bit bigger (especially cargo wise) despite the Macan more or less using the same platform as the Q5.  Its entirely because of the different shapes of the cars.",kid50cal

tk2qij,"It's sitting on a Maserati tuned Stelvio chassis, which is a specially modified version of the Giulia's chassis. Alfa took the chassis, added bigger shocks and coils to compensate for the higher ride, gave it AWD as standard and made it so there's a perfect 50/50 weight distribution (Giulia is closer to 60/40).

I can say from experience, it's a sharp as fuck platform. The only time I feel a little bit of body roll is in 'regular' mode, but turn it to dynamic and it's gone.",giddycocks

MKIV (2004) Volkswagen R32

I've always been obsessed with VW since my first car/driving experience (which was required where I grew up v rural) and I believe they reached their pinnacle when they released the ultimate hot hatch, with their manual 6 speed gearbox and AWD, at the end of the gasoline/non hybrid/electric era. There are entire events dedicated to the exhaust notes that these cars come with stock (I would recommend the flapper mod, ofc). They sound like big kitties purring.

I first heard it coming from the car next to me at a stop light. I was in awe. A little over a decade later I was able to buy one of my own. Now I'm excited every (infrequent) occasion I'm lucky enough to take mine out for a trip. Being a hatch it's also pretty easy to lay down the back seat and transport larger items. It's practical but tourqie enough to be a lot of fun. No one ever expects it to be as quick as it is (for its era) because it just looks like a regular golf. But every once in a while a car person will rush up to you excitedly. If you know, you know.

Thank you for asking this question. I've discovered not many sapphics I know give fucks about cars and/or actively hate them. I think we should start treating them like privately owned horses and only take them to the track to drive fast or if we happen to own private roads (or you live in a remote/rural area), but not as something that continues to clog and pollute cities. They are far too dangerous and autonomous ones are getting close enough that they're probably going to be safer very soon anyway.",rey_as_in_king

This might be a little more subjective on my end, but I've always associated ""Mopar"" with Chrysler specifically in the pre-AMC/Jeep, pre-Mitsubishi/DSM era. Or even pre-Iacocca. When it was just Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Imperial, Fargo, and DeSoto.",Drzhivago138

Nissan stuck with the leaf for like 10 years when they could have been Tesla's competition and moved the EV tipping point forward by at least 5 years. And don't get me started on Toyota. I think at least 2 or 3 of the EV startups will overtake half of the legacy manufacturers who were too risk averse to have any vision.

tk3nca,How is the Mach-E an EV built on an ICE platform? No other Ford looks anything like that thing.,coredumperror
tk3nca,"I kind of agree? I4 and Polestar 2 are on platforms that were designed with a battery in mind. It was supposed to be flexible enough for EV, ICE, and PHEV. Mach-E is a heavily reworked ICE platform.

The Grecale is on the Giorgio platform that Stellantis is moving on from because it was never engineered for electrification.

I think they should have waited until the STLA platforms are ready.",BigStraw
tk3nca,"Not think how good they would be with a ground up design, not to mention cost less to manufacture.",duke_of_alinor
tk3nca,"The Mach-E is built on GE1, a modification of the C2 platform used for the Escape, Bronco Sport, and Maverick. They did a lot of work to it, but it is fundamentally still based on an ICE platform.",Recoil42
tk3nca,the platform it is on is a heavily reworked verison of the C2 platform (Focus).,BigStraw
tk3nca,"Okay so... kinda. Sorta. 

The notion that the i4 and Polestar 2 were on platforms designed with a battery in mind is.. let's say, *overstating* it. Polestar 2's [SPA platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Scalable_Product_Architecture_platform) dates all the way back to 2011 — before the Model S was even released — and the focus was on *hybridization*, not full-on electrification. 

The same goes for BMW's CLAR platform. Go check way back when it was announced, and there's [no mention of electrification](https://www.bmwblog.com/2015/03/19/bmw-cfo-confirms-clar-the-new-rwd-platform-and-future-hybrids/) — only hybridization. Adding battery support was a later revision — note the i4's continued inclusion of a transmission tunnel as evidence of this.

This really just goes to show you *how good you can get it* with an ICEV-based platform. No, none of these cars are perfect, but they're sure as hell *good enough,* while wait for the next generation of platforms to come down the line.",Recoil42

(And C2 isn't discontinued — it's used on the Bronco Sport, Escape, and Maverick. Not only that, but the Focus itself isn't discontinued, and is still sold in Europe.)",Recoil42
