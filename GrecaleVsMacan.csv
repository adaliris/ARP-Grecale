martinto8,It's ok but looks like its taken design cues from a Ford Puma. Would say the interior trumps the Macan except those horrible push buttons as gear selectors. That would most definitely annoy me,"August 30, 2022"
homerdog,"I sat in one at Goodwood - agree that it looked like a Puma, the front end didn't work at all; the massive grill and small headlights jarred, IMO. I wasn't particularly keen on the interior either, as it seemed a bit cheap in places.","August 30, 2022"

EDZ,"Obviously I would disagree with most comments said as I have one on order, ""as is human instinct to protect what you have/own against any competitive other"", in fact goes into build next week. Firstly why journalist keep comparing it to the Macan I just don't Know as this fits into its own segment really in a way, as size wise it fits between the Macan and Cayenne and has the largest internal space of most mid size SUV's. As much as I love the Macan and had them for the last 7 years, ( actually had a Porsche of some kind for the last 16 yrs)  it has fallen behind in many ways against more up to date SUV's on the market.  As for people quoting price !! Believe me I have done the exercise price wise, to spec a Macan anywhere near to the what the Grecale comes with and that's taking a few prices from extras on the Cayenne as not available on Macan it comes to over a 100K and still not everything of what the Grecale has. You should also remember that the price quoted by Maserati includes all taxes first registration etc, 3 year servicing and 3 year fully free connectivity, tracker etc all included FOC in that price, so all of that would have to be added to the 100K on the Macan. For me the Grecale ticks all my boxes so I'm giving it a go especially space wise, tech and obviously that 523 bhp.","August 30, 2022"
SAC1,EDZ - what are the depreciation predictions for when the Grecale is 3 or 4 years old?,"August 30, 2022"
Gibberish,"Always looked at the MC Stadale Gran tourismo with a view to wait until they depreciated enough.. but they're quite rare so haven't dropped much, then you look inside and the switch gear looks like it's out of a Fiat Tipo.All other maserati's seem seriously bad for reliability and residual value, I wouldn't touch one..I would place a firm bet that a 3 year old base Macan gts will be worth more than a 3 year old Grecale even when the maserati is £30k more to start.","August 30, 2022"
crockers,I think it’s a lovely looking car. I’ve driven a Macan and am very impressed with the ride and handling. Are there any Grecales available for testing?Have you driven one?,"August 30, 2022"
EDZ,"Figures being thrown around at present are 28 to 30% but as a new model unknown so they may play on the more cautious side. Unfortunately I can't give precise figures as I don't buy on PCP or finance so have no quoted GFV.  The one I'm getting is the Trofeo Primasirie one of only 10 coming to the UK that's one per dealer, although over a 100k it has absolutely everything thrown at it and more, maybe it will hold value a little more one never knows.","August 30, 2022"
martinto8,The challenge with residuals for Grecale is the 'unknown' due to being new to the compact SUV market. That in itself is a risk and with the depreciation history of other Massas (ie Levante) that could also hurt residuals. As to as why journalist would compare it to Macan? Why wouldn't they? Macan tops most SUVs in the market and if Maserati are going to try and dethrone anyone it would have to be someone at the top,"August 30, 2022"
andreas,One could guess...,"August 30, 2022"
EDZ,"As I said unknown, especially that Maserati are entering the market in a different way now. They now actually have Stellantis ownership investing large sums of money into it, rather than playing second fiddle to the likes of Ferrari of just using the parts bins of other vehicles like Fiat etc. Like the MC20 the Grecale has many of its own parts developed by Maserati and is now moving in a more independent way, as VW and Porsche do. And as most reviews on the MC20 and Grecale have said ""big steps forward for Maserati"". The Macan is more of a mass market produced car and yes a good one. Maserati sell less than a tenth on a good year than Porsche and IMO they have tried to find a whole in the mid size SUV market try to give it what others haven't got, but it will always be compared to others obviously, they have no intentions of drastically increasing production output as VW Porsche, they don't even have the capacity to do so, they just want their own little niche of the market as all manufacturers do, as it is the mid size SUV segment that payrolls the rest of production for them all.","August 30, 2022"
martinto8,Stellantis group own several other car brands fiat being one of them. Never say never when it comes to parts sharing! You just never know!Looking forward to seeing the Grecale. I've no doubt it will be a wonderful car!,"August 30, 2022"
Nella,So it’s really a Vauxhall Frontera/Fiat Multipla crossbreed???,"August 30, 2022"
EDZ,"ObviouslyJust as the Macan is a VW, Audi, Skoda, Cupra, Seat and Scanner lorry crossbread etc.All group manufacturers inter parts where possible and many manufacturers outsource parts from the same suppliers, as demonstrated by the closure of one factory on the outbreak of the Ukraine war which effected several different manufacturers. It's obviously as we know more profitable and less development costs, but as Porsche now avoiding the cheaper looking end of parts and also developing there own which may or may not find there way into other brands in the group anyway.","August 30, 2022"
crockers,Was looking at a SQ5 online and noticed the cruise control stalk is identical to the Macan one.,"August 30, 2022"

EDZ,"It's obvious from your posted comments that you are not a Maserati fan and I respect that, not everyone will be, just as not everyone are fans of Porsche, but it pays to do a little research sometimes before commenting. To quickly quote just one online review of many, this by Carexpert.com ""Orders pilling up especially for Trefeo"" and all dealers have many orders and potential orders for all models for it's general release and arrival in 2023. The special addition is a pre release model as all manufacturers do, usually for avid fans and die hard loyal customers of the brand. I'm not one of those but happened to be in the right place at the right time when the opportunity arose. I don't think Maserati are going to get rich or much coverage by only releasing 10 Trefeo Premaserie to the UK.","August 30, 2022"

andreas,"Well, actually, I generally like most Italian luxury cars, and Maseratis are no exception - although I don't particularly like the frontal styling.  However, I'm sadly not wealthy enough to pay the massive depreciation cost of virtually every Maserati, and I can't see that the Grecale will be any different.  Just a week ago,What Car?magazine published a review of the fastest-depreciating SUVs in the UK, and said that the Levante Trofeo loses a staggering£77Kin the first 3 yrs/36K miles. (https://www.whatcar.com/news/the-10-fas ... 2/n24885#6).You're quite right that it's important to research before commenting.  And you're right to say that Carexpert.com reported that dealer orders are piling up, especially for the Trofeo.  I'd make two comments. Firstly, they would say that wouldn't they?  Maserati and their dealer network are trying (as any manufacturer would) to generate interest in the car and drive traffic into the dealerships.  Secondly, the Carexpert.com article was talking purely about orders inAustralia, not the UK!","August 31, 2022"
New User,I can’t see the Grecale losing more than the X3M Competition quoted in that What Car report.. £60k over 3 years/36K Miles.. Not good for BMW to have two of the Top10 depreciation disaster SUVs in that list btw.

My biggest concern would be the unknown residuals and with only 10 dealerships around the UK you probably will not live close to one, living near Tewkesbury I would have to go to either Cribbs causeway in Bristol or Solihull whereas my Porsche dealership is less than 2 miles away, a tad more convenient!","August 31, 2022"

EDZ,"Grecale -v- Macan by an Owner of Both.This comparison is all written in my own honest opinion and having owned Porsche Macan’s (SD, S and GTS) for over eight years prior to collecting my Grecale Trofeo Primaserie. This comparison is jumping straight out of a Macan GTS (which I had been driving for 18 months prior) into my Grecale Trofeo Primaserie, having now owned the Grecale for three weeks.I very much appreciate that all views and opinions are individual and subjective to everyone, and I am not looking for a debate on my opinions, just quoting them, as a few members on the forum have asked for them.The Grecale is very much on par if not slightly better comfort wise, the fit and finish both internal and external is better on the Grecale, the quality of materials internally are far superior to the Macan, far less plastic. The steering wheel stock (indicators etc) exude quality rather than cheap plastic VW parts bin on the Macan, seat, and head rest backs full quality leather rather than plastic on Macan, in fact almost everything is leather in the Grecale and so much not leather in the Macan. Space inside the Grecale is outstanding and far greater than the Macan especially for rear passengers, my adult kids keep saying how comfortable they are now in the rear and have so much more of a luxury feel and the heated seats and individual touch screen climate controls adds even more to that feel. As for the Sonus Faber 21 speaker, 1285w surround 3D stereo system, this is fantastic and far better than the Burmester top end Porsche stereo (at an extra cost by Porsche of over £3600.00) I had in the Macan. The pedal position is better in the Grecale more comfortable, takes a while in a Macan at first to get comfortable due to the protruding lump in the gearbox tunnel pushing into that area, which would make a long drive uncomfortable occasionally for me.So many little thoughtful touches in the Grecale but not in a Macan, such as being able to put down rear seats from both inside the boot/trunk and also in car rear, door handles lighting up on entry at night, complete stereo, volume, channel, next track controls on back of steering wheel etc ect. Tech wise the Grecale is in a world apart from the Macan, who’s tech is so dated now and so yesterday.To sum up both internally and externally the Grecale exudes elegance, style and quality with a touch of modernism, and so up to date tech wise, whereas the Macan is so dated now unfortunately all round, even after a couple of little face lifts over the last nine years, and too much plastic / leatherette, and far more cheap looking black plastic externally now on the Gen 3 Macan.Performance “WOW”! This is something that stands head and shoulders above the Macan, you do not expect such grunt the first couple of times you put your foot down especially in sport and corsa modes. The sound and feel are so much more theatrical, and power feels more like 590hp than the 530hp quoted, the car encourages you and it really does not feel like an SUV when throwing it around. The steering, though just a tad light for me, but very precise and you soon get to know it, braking is good and confident no fad, this is a real drivers car, don’t get me wrong the Macan GTS is a good car but more of a anyone can drive feel (even Miss Daisy herself), you don’t get that theatrical feel or as much feeling that you are in a real performance car with the Macan.You definitely would not be disappointed with the Grecale Trofeo, in the way it goes, its power, steering and stopping its right up there with some of the very best, a true driver’s car with so much theatre, sound and feel and forgetting that you are in an SUV.The comfort levels you can obtain by changing varying parameters in suspension is good both around town, open roads and even twisty county lanes, though I must say on the UK’s bad roads apart from a few, in corsa mode you need to select soft damper mode as in hard it can be a little rough, but on track if you so wish I’m sure hard mode would be perfect. Having now played with varying setting it is easy to select what you need or want for your own required comfort levels, and for me it covers all of them areas perfectly.My Conclusion: The Grecale beats the Macan easily on almost every level and I am so happy that I took the plunge and turned my back on the Macan. Sorry Porsche but having owed one of your cars in differing model for the last 16 years and Macan’s for the last 8 years, you have lost a customer, who regrets the change to a Grecale not one little bit.And I must say despite reading on this forum of owners having tech issues etc, so far, my car has been great with no issues whatsoever, long may that last. I now come to expect tech issues and updates are and were required as I had many of them, and even one only two days before getting the Grecale on my past Macan’s.Thanks for reading and hope it will be a little help to anyone contemplating buying a Grecale or. and thinking of moving away from a Macan.","May 25, 2023"

EDZ,"Will doAnd then best you don't read the Macan forum as they have just as many issues if not more, some of which have been on going for a couple of years and repeat themselves, along with mechanical issues as well. Leaking pano roofs, rear washer failure filling rear cabin with water, transfer box failure, timing chain covers leaking oil, failing ABS sensors, panel miss alignment when car gets hot, etc etc. Porsche have also removed several things from the Macan and not replaced, such as no electric steering column anymore back to manual, to name but one. All modern technology just like your mobile phone unfortunately get bugs and require regular updates and fixing etc, As I have said earlier. ! the Porsche Macan has been out for over nine years and stlll has issues, both electronically and mechanically, as do many other manufacturers.","April 28, 2023"

GrecaleNYC,"Nice to see you here on this forum@EDZ, (I’m “macanS” on the Macan forum, joined Dec. 2013), and thanks for your review.I’ve been eyeing the Grecale for many months now and have been driving my Macan S since July 2014. The trofeo is a big price jump from the Modena so I’m hoping I can make that leap. Performance wise, I’m sure I’ll be “satisfied” with Modena as compared to my now aging Macan, but the overall upgrade in build and design of the Maserati is nice to hear about from a long time Macan owner like yourself.Time will tell what will happen with my next car purchase, I’ll keep you posted!","April 30, 2023"
EDZ,"Hi GrecaleNYCThe Modena is also a great car and has just as much luxury and tech, I'm sure you would not be disappointed with that either.What I do hear from a lot of GTS Macan owners is ""Look at the price difference so expensive"" . Believe me I have done a comparison with regards to price before ordering the Grecale Trofeo against the Macan GTS.To spec a Macan GTS anywhere near to the Grecale Trefeo and that included taking some prices of extras from the Cayenne as some items you just can not even spec on a Macan, it came out at 103k in the UK and still did not have everything that the Grecale comes with especially tech wise. Then you have to remember the Grecale price quoted comes with 3 year services, includes on the road (VED) and 3 year connectivity, road map navigation updates etc in the UK, which would add another 5k to the Macan price in the UK, as Porsche don't include these in their price, this takes the Macan GTS to around 108k. Next you have to look at the engine and power difference, if Porsche still did the Turbo Macan and could give it 530bhp the uplift (extra) in starting basic price going by the difference between Macan, T, S and GTS would be another 12k aprox, so this would make the Macan in the region of 120k which is actually far more than the top spec Trofeo with every extra added.The next thing they throw at you is depreciation !! Depreciation figures are normally calculated on basic standard MRP of cars, and no matter what Porsche you buy one has to spend at least another 10k to even get basic luxuries that most other manufactures include, So if you were to buy A Macan spec as near to a Trefeo as poss aprox cost 120K the depreciation figure would also be the same as the Trefeo at least, IMO.When looking at a genuine price comparisons like for like the Grecale is easily on par with the Porsche Macan, but the Grecale is in my opinion worth a little extra for the better luxury you get and more of a rare car than the mass marketed Macan.","May 1, 2023"

WarrenB,"It has a setting that allows you to set the car to lower itself to its lowest height (aero 2) when the car is in park and on level ground. Mine doesn’t always work however. Like a lot in this car, there are a lot of quirks and defects that is going to take them a while to sort out so it’s going to mean a lot of trips to the dealer for most people. My dealer told me that some people did around 20 trips to the dealer when they released the Ghibli.It’s a great design and I love the interior, but it’s a quirky drive and the tech is a little dated or lacking compared to its competitors releases this year. The HUD is average at best, no self no parking, no parking reverse from phone app, no virtual reality navigation, no draggable 360 surround view or zoom function, camera quality is awful, reverse camera parking lines and sensor beeping is as bad as it is in our 2017 Ghibli where it beeps like crazy even though you are a mile from the curb. The only thing the Grecale has new as far as tech that our 2017 Ghibli doesn’t have is the 360 camera view. It’s same old in a much nicer UI with a better quality screen. There is a lot of good quality like the leather but some awful quality like the glossy buttons on the doors and steering wheel And what’s with the backlit buttons that are extremely dim and off when the car is off. I’m tired of having to remind valet’s where the start button is because it doesn’t show when the car is off!Many say the Success of the Grecale is going to be the difference between death or survival for Maserati as they expect 80% of their sales to come from it, but is it good enough at the price point to take sales away from Porsche, BMW and Mercedes? I’ve had so many issues with mine that it’s currently going through the repurchase process.","May 25, 2023"

ghostwalker,"£95,000 base price for the V6 is a bit cheeky, though. I mean the X3M is 90 list, and they’ve sorted out the ride quality on that, and new, unregistered ones on Autotrader etc are selling for low 70s, which is about right.Also, from a design standpoint, I did initially submit an expression of interest before it became apparent that it looks somewhat like a Ford Puma, and this has been noted among enthusiasts as well. I will probably look to sample the driving experience at some point, though.But yes, a confusing car on the face of it, and £20k+ above what it should be. They may sell a few of the cheaper 4 cyl models, but even they are £60k. I don’t see this having anywhere near as many takers as the Macan or quicker X3 models, or even the Stelvio QV for that matter.","December 27, 2022"

ghostwalker,"I agree,  Jon. The ride definitely looks way below par for an SUV on air springs, and that could be a major drawback for those in the market for these things.The G3 GTS for instance, if I’ve understood this correctly, has a no-cost option to delete the 10mm ride height reduction to improve the ride, which I already found to be good enough on G2 on 21” wheels. It wasn’t floaty but it wasn’t uncomfortable either.I’m also told that Jaguar have, as they usually do, nailed the ride on the F Pace SVR, which, besides being a lot cheaper, has that epic 5.0L V8 with the supercharger.Too many great choices and Maserati aren’t making a compelling enough case IMO.","December 27, 2022"
ghostwalker,"Agreed. And on engine sound, the bigger Levante, despite being as boring as anything in normal form, is almost worth the silly £130k price tag just for that Ferrari V8 in the Trofeo. Maserati just do things differently but, as you say, the depreciation isn’t for the faint-hearted.","December 27, 2022"
softsand,This one also includes a few autobahn high speed runs where it ran out of steam at 295km/h - a bit butt clenching with the traffic around...,"December 28, 2022"

wab172uk,"I actually quite like the look of them.But the price / power gaps are just bonkers. For the same price as a decent specced 380bhp Macan S, you only get a 2.0L 4 pot with 330bhp in the Grecale. The next power increase is 580bhp for £95,560.They would have been better copying the Macan range. Give the mid-level car 380-400bhp V6. There is still a substantial jump to the full bore Trofeo model.The Maserati prices make the Macan look a bargain in comparison. The Maserati badge just doesn't hold the same prestige it once did. And recent modern cars hadn't exactly got people pulses racing, and never win any kind of group tests. The reason why they maybe don't sell in great numbers is the pricing.","December 28, 2022"
Tracky,The Macan isn't a looker and nor is that !,"December 28, 2022"
