Gumpclipper,"Good morning all,I am looking at buying my first Porsche.Is there any advice you would give for essential Macan S options?I am also looking to potentially use Porsche finance, reading some of the older posts there seems to be limited to zero negotiation on rates and discounts. Has anyone any recent experience? Will probably be using Porsche Stockport.Any advice is appreciated.Thanks! ","October 10, 2021",Porsche Macan
Voodoo Blue,"I’m not going to offer an opinion on spec as this is pretty subjective but would suggest you try to see and drive a few different cars to form an idea of what you want. The salesperson will almost certainly suggest some “essential “ options to help with the sale of the car once you’re done with it but it is up to you if you really want or need them.As far as discounts go, they’re not unheard of but being new to the brand and the shortage of new car availability I’d suggest that getting one would be very unlikely. But no harm trying even if it means getting a few freebie’s. I’m told the current waiting time is around 9 months for a new order so be prepared for that as well.Porsche finance isn’t the most competitive and there are other providers that will do a better deal so definitely worth shopping around to see what’s available.Other that that you might want to pop over to https://www.macanforums.co.uk. They are a very knowledgeable and friendly bunch who discuss this very topic on a regular basis so will probably prove quite helpful in your quest. ","October 10, 2021",Porsche Macan

notsomadmick,"I've had 6 Macans. 2 DS and 4 GTS. I've owned a lot of cars over the years. 15 of them Porsches. I drive fast when it is safe to do so. The Macan GTS - with PASM, PTV+, 20 inch Spyder wheels and 18-way seats is the most complete vehicle you can ever buy. It does more things in one package than any other car can. It's almost a sports car, it can take the dogs, the kids, and goes round corners in a way that defies belief - certainly for an SUV anyway. Don't bother with the sunroof - unless you need it. Full leather is nice to have if you can. Don't bother with air suspension, you loose feel. Don't waste your money on Bose. It's no better than the standard set up - and steals useful floor space in the boot. LEDs are nice to have, but not a deal breaker. The 3.0 DS in similar spec is still a great car. You don't really need a turbo version unless cash is of no concern. Dip you bread it's a buyers market at the moment. ","January 08, 2019",Porsche Macan

Koln-RS,"Whilst the Macan is not a true Porsche sports car, it is hard to fault as luxury, sporting SUV. If he really needs a versatile 4/5 seater, then he won't be disappointed - but its not a 911 or a Cayman.I've driven several variants, but not the latest 'facelift' model, and they are all good in different ways. The GTS sounds lovely, but quite thirsty. The DS also sounds pretty good with the sports exhaust, very good mid-range power delivery and will do a genuine 40 mpg.Nicest options are the sports seats (18 way), Air Suspension and PASM for the best ride/handling, I wouldn't go above 20"" wheels, panoramic roof is popular.

HM-2,"A GTS or Turbo on 19"" wheels is a pretty perfect single car all rounder in the UK but as a potential buyer (as I've considered the Macan as a replacement for my 140i) the residuals are hard to stomach. £40k for a 5 year old GTS with 70k on the clock puts you in a lot of equally competent newer performance cars of similar utility, or a range of similarly aged but somewhat more bonkers options that are still daily usable.

off_again,"Bought a 2021 Macan S in March! I knew what I was looking for and it was on the shortlist but allowed my wife to test drive a whole bunch of cars to see what she wanted. Tried everything from a Jag F-Type to an Evoque to a mix of Kia's, a couple of Audi's and Mercs and even a Tesla. She drove the Macan and didnt really say much.... didnt think too much about it.Next working day, sent me the details on the offer, package and dealer incentives etc... yep, she made her mind up on the spot and it matched with mine! While they get criticism for the array of buttons, which I thought she would hate, she ended up loving it. Not necessarily helped by test driving the new Evoque just beforehand, which had 100% touchscreens that just didnt work well. Pretty simple and easy to use, but in the sun the reflection was awful and you ended up not being able to see them! Buttons all the way (though I know its changing for the 2022 Macan).Had a Cayenne before which was really good, if expensive car to run. But the Macan really is a bigger hot hatch! Fast, nimble, easy to drive and suspiciously quick! Oh, and the ride is fantastic. We dont have the air suspension, but even without it, the ride is very good and its super quiet too. As mentioned by others, its a really good all-rounder. If you want to cruise quietly, it can do that. If you want to tackle a nice mountain road, it can do that too.... and practicality is good too.Criticisms? The updated infotainment is good and works well, BUT it can take a little longer to hook up for wireless CarPlay and doesnt like switching between phones, but thats small. Rear space isnt great either, so dont expect some roomy cavern on the inside. The seats are excellent, but you will want the 14 way ones, which are usually extra. If you have the tow accessory, the rear hatch hands-free opening doesnt work at all and for the US market, you dont get full open / close for the windows on the remote - its disabled for some damn reason! Even my low spec i3 has that!!! And its not an option that a Porsche dealer can turn on either. They arent allowed, even though its in the PIWIS system! Biggest criticism? Extras.... you will pay a lot for them, many of which are simply not worth the money... just take a look at the configurator at some of the personalization options, you can spend thousands on stuff you dont need!Cars sold in the US come with a 3 year warranty, 1 years servicing (get a second for free from my dealer), free Lo-Jack and I even managed to get a small discount before the car market went bonkers! Fully intend to keep the car for at least 3 years as it is fantastic. Unless I win some sort of lottery or have a windfall, this one is a keeper!Oh, and its currently at a bodyshop having a small dent / paint chip fixed - these things happen and I was prepared to just let it roll. But no, the wife wanted it perfect - I think she has fallen for it! ","July 28, 2021",Porsche Macan

lornemalvo,"I test drove a base Macan last year and it was nice to drive, without a shadow of a doubt ( although I didn't like the protruding centre bulkhead that pushed my left foot into an unnatural position). I read a great deal about them and came to the conclusion that from an engineering point of view, the Macan is both brilliant and appalling. The interior quality is stunning. It just shouts quality and makes my (otherwise nice) Audi A4 interior look like a Lada. The feel of the drive is really nice, although the base engine was not that impressive, although probably fine in daily use.On the down side, I'm staggered that people accept the almost inevitable and extremely expensive mechanical issues that these cars seem to come with, at relatively low mileages. The Macan is not a new car, so why the engines and transfer boxes persist with these faults is beyond me. Either Porsche are unable or are unwilling to develop their product properly. So ownership, in my view, can only be for me while the car has an OPC warranty, which is a major expense on top of an expensive car to run. The final straw is the way prices of used cars have gone.

When I started thinking about a Macan GTS last year I was offered a test drive, only to turn up and be told they didn't have the GTS on site but I could have a go in the 2.0 model instead.Honestly, 20 mins in it very nearly made me forget the Macan entirely. Very quiet, gutless and didn't feel hugely different to my mum's Q3. It also seemed like it would be poor on fuel, but I didn't spend enough time in it to confirm.I've now had my GTS for a few months and in reality isn't quite as much of a sports car as the marketing would have you think, even with all the right options ticked. It definitely doesn't feel as fast as the 0-60 would have you believe either - I guess launch control is to blame for that. As a daily driver that I can fit a drum kit/guitar rig/camping stuff in the back of it's a decent package, but I certainly wouldn't be in a rush to sell a sports car for it!

It's not like they've saved a load of weight by going IC plus it will become more and more of a nuisance to run.A 911 petrol definitely petrol for the sound and handling but in this there isn't a lot of point. ,"November 13, 2021",Porsche Macan

I don't think a 2.0 four pot in 2 tons of SUV to be good enough. A Cayman or even a Defender/Ineos/Landcruiser perhaps but not a crossover. Especially as the Hyundai 5 will out accelerate the Macan, looks better, has a brighter interior and has a very rapid charging time.An inline 6, V8, V10, V12 (hence your name) can have a magnificent sound but a 2.0 turbo is just a way of moving a car.I'm guessing in the next couple of years there will be an electric replacement for the Macan, it will be brilliant and nobody will want these.

We live in NE London which is speed bump central, the last time that the Discovery was stolen, it averaged 50 mph on a 3 mile trip, lots of scrapes and dents added for good measure. Unbeknown to us, the force of the impacts was so great that the cooling fan shredded a dislodged rad pipe which left us stranded in Austria 3 weeks later ( JLR to their credit collected the car and returned it to us FoC ) when it was stolen, the Police wouldn’t even come to meet us to collect it ( it had a tracker ).

off_again,"Oso said:A clever argument, but even the most myopically badge-obsessed buyer now knows that the Macan is built on a platform Audi ditched years ago, that Porsche is nursing along until it’s allowed to rebadge the Q4.Ouch, but a little incorrect. Yes, the Macan and Q5 were built on the MLB platform, there differences are pretty dramatic. Only around 20% of the base chassis shares common parts and Porsche made significant changes from the engines (not so much now) to gearbox to 4WD system. And that’s before you get to the suspension setup, pickup points and additional structural parts that Porsche added. So yeah, it’s the same platform if that works for you.Audi did make a change and shifted to the MLB evo platform for later models, while Porsche stuck with the success that they had and further refined it. Yes, there are some “Porscheness” stuff they claim to have done - like the changed brake mechanism to “add more feel”, but they are very different cars, just happen to have some of the body pickup points that are very similar.But hey, don’t let details get in the way of a story.Now, if we want to dig in on some of weird stuff that Porsche did, that was bizarre and went wrong, that’s fine. The early V6 engines (absolutely NOT Audi engines) have oil leak issues that need an engine out to fix. Then there are the transfer box issues that can cost thousands to fix. Oh and there are reports of some engines going pop! Not the type of quality that you would expect for that price. Oddly the VW sourced 2.0T engine is the most reliable one, especially from the early models. Now they have switched to a derivative of the Audi 2.9 V6 in different states of tune which seems to be significantly more reliable and stout. Oh and they take to tuning very well. The very latest models have the 3.0 V6, but not sure if that’s a Porsche or Audi engine now. But still that 2.0T is still there. From what I am aware of, a small remap and it gets a lot peppier and removes hesitancy from it. But the question still remains, is there enough of a price difference or saving on MPG to justify not going to the V6? That is the tough question to answer.

No ta, not for me at least.Totally agree but it is a product of our time. With so many governments around the world forcing fuel economy and emissions regulations on cars, they really had to do something that got close to what the market was being forced to be. Is it ideal? Nah, but when you are still a niche manufacturer, you have to consider the wider market and have something that can sell in decent numbers. And that’s what it is all about - they have to sell cars, and with that they can continue to develop and manufacture interesting ones.And I did read in one of the most recent PCA magazines about the 2.0T sales numbers. Seems that most of them are sold in China! That’s the big market for them and hence will likely continue down this path for a while at least. That market is very brand aware and yes, a fair percentage of buyers there are getting it because of the badge. But it’s their choice and it is still only a niche product in such a vast market.Is it worth 50k? Probably not. You can easily spec one above a base S and at that point I absolutely would be going for the bigger engine. And it’s worth noting that the 2.0T isn’t that much more economical in real world situations. So a lot of the cost savings will be down to local tax and emissions regulations, and we are back to the global market conditions issue again.

cerb4.5lee,"soxboy said:The v6 is £6k more, although it has got better wheels that are a £2k option on the 2.0T and I assume will have better residuals, so the difference may be much less on the all-important monthlies.To be fair to Porsche, I don’t think there are many other SUVs for under £50k that are available with more than 4 cylinders.The GLC350d(3.0 V6) I have was £45k new(paid £50k with the options on it though). Mercedes dropped the 6 cylinder diesel engine in it when they facelifted it(which you allude to), so if you wanted a diesel model you could only go for the 4 cylinder engine.Punters don't seem to want more than 4 cylinder engines now, so I can definitely understand why Porsche have gone in this direction.

FWIW and the sake of balance without the hackneyed cliches, I bought an RRS after testing three variants of the Macan; the diesel, the S and the GTS as well as an X3 M40i. In the end it simply came down to space, the RRS has more of it and was the one we chose and at no point do I feel as if I've lost out on anything. Of all three (or four) the GTS was the one for me and whilst it was more dynamic drive than the RRS - no real surprise there - the compromise on space was too much. Is the Macan a 'better' car? Of course it isn't, it's what it is to the driver and the RRS is no better or worse either.Oh, and I'm of average height, live in a small village, have no gates to my driveway and my RRS is nearly five years old. I also had a Discovery as a loaner and that was too big for our needs.

Yet the X5 drove nothing like a car for me personally though...because the bloody thing weighed 2200kg! It was like piloting a boat in the corners!Ok. Deposit placed on an S.BUT - I may be changing down to the 2.0, purely because the steering was so pure without the extra weight of the V6 over the front. Although - I've yet to try an S with Power Steering Plus, the one I tried didn't have it. The two 2.0s I tried (one a Gen 2, the other a Gen 3) did.As many have said, the base Macan is plenty quick enough.I shall make my mind up in the coming months.Btw, delivery has been quoted as late Q1/early Q2 next year.

I tried most premium SUV's whilst deciding on what to drive between now and the kids buggering off, and I found RR's to be big, cumbersome trucks, the new Jag f pace to be competent but zero character, with a downmarket interior, and all the BM, Audis to be as disappointing as I expected.I found the Macan to be a hoot, as I could chuck it down an a road at bonkers speeds, and still do motorway cruises in quiet comfort. It'll never be a sports car, but in the same way that the wifes R is the best compromise of fun and practicality in the medium hatch segment, I find the macan turbo (or gts) to be the best growing family car compromise.

NAS90,"I'm surprised by all the negativity about the Macan; when I first saw it/ heard about it I was somewhat sceptical, but having driven all the petrol models on road and track, I'm very impressed with it. I think one issue is what you choose to compare it to, Porsche define all of their 4 door concepts as the first sports cars in their segment, critical part of that being 'in their segment'.The Macan is a mid size premium SUV and the competition in that segment is Q5, Evoque, Tiguan R, X3 and now the new Jaguar F Pace. Drive it in a comparative test against its competition and you will agree with Porsche's marketing speak. Whilst I have yet to drive the Jaguar, the Macan's gearbox, chassis, engine response, etc. leaves the rest miles behind in terms of sporty feel and driving precision, take it on track and you'll surprise several drivers of so called 'sports cars', the Macan S in Sports mode, using the manual paddles is a quick motor, the GTS and Turbo even more so.Someone earlier on said the Macan was rubbish off road, I'm afraid I'm going to disagree with that also, i've driven it in the desert, on the beach, in the mountains and on dedicated off road testing courses and whilst it is no Land Rover Defender, the offload mode makes it very capable in most offload situations, over rocks the way the PSM moves traction to the wheels that have grip is really clever. Offload you always have to remember that you have road tyres and vulnerable bumpers but driven properly the Macan will go most places 99.9% of owners will ever need it to.If however you compare it to a Cayman/ Boxster/ 911 on the road then of course it feels disappointing, it is a sporty mid sized SUV, not a sports car. If however you see the Macan as a practical car that covers most requirements of family and outdoor life with the ability to be driven hard on road when you are in the mood, then you'll not be disappointed, as someone else previously said i think, the GTS is the pick of the range.

EricE,"Orangecurry said:I was being semi-serious - is it just ground clearance?Lots of reasons. The extra height gives you better overview over the road and traffic. People generally feel safer in SUVs because they sit above most the ""regular traffic"". I'd like to note that most lethal accidents involve a rollover and SUVs have a much higher center of gravity but whatever.Longer suspension travel, larger tyres and higher car weight give you greater comfort over potholes and save you slowing down for speed bumps. Unless you opt for low profile tyres with big rims.Many people look down on estates. I never understood that but assume that is because so many company cars are estates. SUVs are estates minus the whole ""sensible""/""practical"" image that people seem to hate so much.The higher entry position makes them easier to get in and out of. That's a major point for older or obese people. Both demographics are growing rapidly.Many people in my area want AWD for winter. Normal cars/estates often only offer AWD in combination larger engine which bumps the price up to where a normal AWD car isn't much cheaper than the corresponding SUV variant. At that point they just go with the SUV because of the aforementioned reasons. Orangecurry said: ","July 09, 2016",Porsche Macan

GT3cs,"spareparts said:Macan GTS or Macan Turbo... both are similar on paper, with a small advantage to the Turbo, for a 7k premium. In the real world, are there any significant differences? Because of scarce availability , I have not been able to get a test drive in a Turbo or GTS, but have driven a 3.0S which was superb. Any thoughts on which one (GTS/Turbo) is the one to go for?Turbo performance pack . 440bhp with GTS suspension , big brakes and noisy exhaust . Best of both worlds and going to be pretty rare by all accounts ...... spareparts said: ","September 19, 2016",Porsche Macan
bompey,"I had a Turbo for nearly 2 years and now have a GTS and they are both great cars. I prefer the GTS out of the 2 as it is more involving to drive. The Turbo was very powerful and using it as our main car we spent most of the time coasting along or hovering over the brake. It's almost limo like whereas the GTS has a bit less power so it needs to be driven more, it's much more involving. The suspension and the exhaust are much sportier.Spec up each model and see how you get on. ","September 19, 2016",Porsche Macan
langlord,"As people has said go and try the gts if you can find a demo to actually test drive, as the suspension revisions are notable and its the reason the same setup has been used on the turbo with the performance pack. The PSE is also notably louder if that's another requirement you have.I agree with comments about the F pace, I had one on order and I cancelled once I got to physically see the car. At entry level I think it is probably the best value all round SUV, however once you get up to the S model the interior is lacking in quality. ","September 20, 2016",Porsche Macan
spareparts,"The Macan will be the family wagon, so noise is nice to have, but not the absolute requirement. I already have other more focused toys to give the noise/performance hit. The Macan's superlative quality of drive are why it is our top choice amongst a variety of practical cars for our needs. The effortless shove of the Turbo is always nice, but I am wondering whether the cost premium is really worth it over the already performant GTS. As with any family wagon, this is mostly a head decision and less so heart. The residuals on both are very strong, but with the imminent release of the Performance Pack Turbo due for release in Q1, I wonder if the standard Turbo will be of lesser interest. I think there are really only 4 standout models:- base 2.0- S Diesel- GTS- ... TurboPP? ","September 20, 2016",Porsche Macan
Bernardino,"I've been reading this topic with great interest as we have an S diesel arriving in the next few weeks.It's a long boring sensible story but basically me and the other half are swapping the 997 and 981 in for the Macan. The idea was to get a turbo however, our local OPC offered us a great deal on a new diesel so we went for it.I first drove the 2.0 version as a loan car at the end of last year and after a week was very taken with it. I then had a go in a turbo at PEC and I couldn't believe the performance. Having driven the diesel now, I'm also impressed with it.I would never compare any of the variants to the 997 or 981 but for a family car it really is one of the best I've driven.I'm wondering if we should of opted for a GTS however, I'll be looking to get my sports car fix at some point next year in the form of an early generation boxster but that's another story.

And the Macan feels like a quality/premium product which it is- even though it is compact. So all round, it feels the best product for us.

There are lots of features of cars that only become apparent on ownership - a decent example being how long it takes for the macan to engage reverse. That 1 or 2 second opause might not sound a lot, but, it is when you are in a busy road trying to reverse park. Re the macan / fpace few vs thousands. Nonsense. The F pace is only just hitting UK roads. Certainly though, the cost of ownership of the macan over 2 years was very reasonable with residuals quite strong. I think the fpace interior quality perceptions are quite spec specific. I thought that too when I saw a few at events. Pleased with how ours has turned out however. No quality issues at all.By the way we made a deliberate choice to revert to petrol, as the diesel / emmissions backlash continues to roll and it wont be long til we get the introduction of penalty charges for London's CC zone for diesel cars. langlord said: ","September 28, 2016",Porsche Macan

When I checked in with the dealer, my car wasn’t ready. They asked how I liked the Macan. I said I preferred the Cayenne because of the engine characteristics. Lots of power all the time. The dealer told me to go out and screw the st out of the Macan. (US dealers have a different attitude to UK). As I joined the highway there was a new 911 Turbo and an older M3. We all went for it. The 911 was clearly the fastest by a long way. But, the Macan did surprise me.The thing is, I love my car for how it drives at normal speeds and not at the limit.

MortyC137,"There's no such thing as Porsche reliability. I wouldn't dare own one without a proper warranty.What is different to most other manufacturers is how well they look after you when it breaks. The warranty is not that expensive, and covers all these wallet-destroying issues. The coffee and hospitality is great. The courtesy cars are top notch. They'll even collect/drop off it if you ask nicely, but I always enjoy a visit to the showroom to see what's in.My first Cayenne was an absolute bork-fest. 5 dealer visits, and engine out twice. It didn't cost me a penny, just some inconvenience when it broke down. I still bought another Cayenne, as there's nothing else quite like it. I suspect the current one needs it's first trip to the dealer soon for early transfer box issues. If I'm unlucky it's just a worn engine mount or something, which will be wear and tear, and not a warranty issue.I don't think Porsches are reliable at all, but they don't half look after you well when it breaks. Whether that's enough to make people put up with them is probably a personal choice. ","September 02, 2021",Porsche Macan

Mine had £17k of options on top of the decent Turbo spec but I bought it two years old and saved 1/3 of original cost.Other than the expense of the extended warranty I have been very happy so far.Dont like black wheels on black cars but mine has silver turbo wheels which look great IMO.And I much prefer the click of the buttons which I can do without looking now than reaching and looking for a touchscreen.Edited by Adam. on Sunday 5th September 11:31 Turini said: Edited by Adam. on Sunday 5th September 11:31 ","September 05, 2021",Porsche Macan

On a car I plan to keep for 5 years I would spec with what I need and a few things I would like and improve the ownership experience thanks.Had I been able to afford to spec the car from new I probably would have spent 8-10 of the 17k the original owner spent.

MortyC137,"MortyC137 said:There's no such thing as Porsche reliability. I wouldn't dare own one without a proper warranty.What is different to most other manufacturers is how well they look after you when it breaks. The warranty is not that expensive, and covers all these wallet-destroying issues. The coffee and hospitality is great. The courtesy cars are top notch. They'll even collect/drop off it if you ask nicely, but I always enjoy a visit to the showroom to see what's in.My first Cayenne was an absolute bork-fest. 5 dealer visits, and engine out twice. It didn't cost me a penny, just some inconvenience when it broke down. I still bought another Cayenne, as there's nothing else quite like it. I suspect the current one needs it's first trip to the dealer soon for early transfer box issues. If I'm unlucky it's just a worn engine mount or something, which will be wear and tear, and not a warranty issue.I don't think Porsches are reliable at all, but they don't half look after you well when it breaks. Whether that's enough to make people put up with them is probably a personal choice.Pleased to report my crystal ball is working flawlessly.Cayenne dropped off at OPC, new 3-series loaner for the week (which is ok, I suppose), and new transfer box being fitted under warranty. That'll be £0.00 please.Endless hassle, or great service when it goes wrong and no real cost worries? You decide. MortyC137 said: ","September 07, 2021",Porsche Macan

IJB1959,"Reading through the posts here I really cannot understand some of the Macan GTS criticisms. If you don't like something or think it's too expensive, option it out or go for a lesser model instead. Porsche offer something for nearly everybody, so if it's too small buy a Cayenne, hate the GTS grill buy a S, hate the coloured vents? then don't option it. You are after all buying into a driver/owner focused brand rather than an all round practical family SUV. I have test driven the F-Pace, Stelvio, RSQ5, X3M, and other comparables and NOTHING comes even close to the V6 S & GTS when all is considered. The residuals are fantastic, and if you are lucky enough to purchase one (the wait is <>12 months) the car is generally worth more than you paid for it when delivered. A friend purchased a reasonably specked 2021 Macan Turbo and was offered 10k more than he paid for it by the dealership on collection day......he refused it BTW. If you do any research or online reviews on the Macan model you would be very hard pressed to find anything particularly negative whichever model you choose, although most say the Macan S is the 'sweet spot' model to purchase.

Yes, the Cayenne looks and feels bigger next to it, but the Macan is still a practical size for most purposes.My first impressions are that it is much more car-like and sportier to drive, with superior performance, handling and economy. Ride feels very good, but this one has 21"" wheels on Pirelli P-Zeros and, despite Air & PASM, feels a touch fidgety on some UK roads. From Cayenne experience, I think 20"" on 'all seasons' would give a more relaxed ride.Inevitably, the big consideration is the options list. You can create a mighty impressive vehicle, but £20ks of options is easily consumed.One point; spoke to a chap at the OPC and he said the 'petrol' and 'diesel' Macans do feel like very different cars.

Maybe the article tells us that but I find John’s prose unreadable so not sure.Youve described it exactly the same way as I would except I also think it looks good. Would love this as by daily.

It seems it’s a fairly mediocre M car and the market agrees, if they depreciate that much in “this” market….On the 69 plate ones they did have a very big discount so actual price paid would be more like £65k. Even on my 21 plate X3m comp i got a £17.5k dealer contribution.For me its a perfect one car does all. Its very fast, lots of space and not super expensive to run as insurance was like £700, full tank about £90-£110 and only do about 5k miles a year.I would be tempted by an LCI in the future as an M3 touring will be £900-£1k a month car even with a big deposit where my x3m is about £500pm.Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54 GTEYE said: Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54 ","April 15, 2022",BMW X3

J-P,"Article is dumb - of course it's not as good as an M3. And there's no view as to whether it's any better than rivals (apart from the F-Pace SVR), but having owned a few JLR products, I'm never going back there. Terrible quality and generally shocking service.Also, having just bought one and having owned an X3 M40i before it, I would say that this is a superior car to the X3 M40i - yes it's quicker (a LOT quicker) but it also handles better, makes less road noise on bad surfaces and although people complain about it having a firm ride, I've no idea what they are talking about - the ride is absolutely fine. The GLC 63 AMG S i drove a few years ago had a far worse ride (but did sound epic). I notice that the test car had Continental Sport Contact tyres, mine has the Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S, not sure if that makes a difference or not? But mine both handles and rides really well.I did like the creamy smoothness of the X3 M40i but this car sounds fine too! Better than the Macan Turbo I drove but sure not as good as the GLC 63 AMG S. It doesn't handle as well as the Porsche but it's not a million miles off and I paid nothing like £90k for mine (and wouldn't have).

It seems it’s a fairly mediocre M car and the market agrees, if they depreciate that much in “this” market….On the 69 plate ones they did have a very big discount so actual price paid would be more like £65k. Even on my 21 plate X3m comp i got a £17.5k dealer contribution.For me its a perfect one car does all. Its very fast, lots of space and not super expensive to run as insurance was like £700, full tank about £90-£110 and only do about 5k miles a year.I would be tempted by an LCI in the future as an M3 touring will be £900-£1k a month car even with a big deposit where my x3m is about £500pm.Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54Unfortunately, those days are gone. Speaking to my BMW dealer on and off over the last few months, the days of big discounts and low interest rates are over and won’t be returning for a long time. That doesn’t just apply to M3s, it applies to M5s and even 550is. Even a heavily optioned M340d Touring (admittedly zero deposit) is c. £900 p/m. I’m pretty sure if you got a quote for an X3M, it wouldn’t be much less than an M3.If it is, then I need to find a new dealer!!

GrantD5,"How's it going people? It's been a while since I have posted on here.Some may know, I was doing Uber driving and I have a VW Jetta for that but through lockdown I stopped and the car went to my Mum as I barely used it! Anyway I had a moped and I was doing Uber Eats etc for a while in London and it has been 1 year already. The bike sold yesterday and it was time to get another car. I will be going back to Uber very soon just waiting on TFL to pull their finger out of their backsides.Anyway, I sold the Ford Transit as I just had no use or the van anymore, just as the van was in a perfect working state ha.Today I drove 90 miles to Kettering and purchased this! 2004 BMW X3 3.0 Petrol 4 Wheel Drive. Pulled out the iPhone for some photos! Nice foggy day.While browsing on and off recently I noticed the market for the 6 cylinder autos tended to be 2.5i 4wd and 3.0i rear wheel drive. I had a 3.0i RWD lined up to go and see and I had one last look before leaving today and found this! I'm not sure how common the the 3.0i 4WD are but I never really noticed many and I was debating between going for the 4wd and slower or RWD and faster. But this is the best of both.Anyway the car drove faultlessly, but the EML came on - quick phone call with the home dealer and had the explanation of plugs and coils changed recently and the EML comes on sometimes??? So some digging in to that needed but the car was driving fine so I wasn't to phased. Also the airbag light come on as I pulled up at home, assuming its the occupancy sensor similar to E46 niggles.But apart from the the remote locking works, on one key at least think one may need a battery. All windows go up & down, the displays all work and are not pixelated, it has the locking nut, it has MOT, it has some history and it seems to just work. It has a CD player stereo and 6CD changer in the arm rest but it needs to go. I'd like a screen set up in the dashboard cubbyhole like on some models.My only pain with the 4WD was wanting to get the X5 wheels that I had on the X1 also but the rears are wider so far as I know that's no good for 4WD and need a square set up?Not sure what the overall plans are just nice to be in a nice enough daily car that's going to kill the wallet on petrol. At least it is ULEZ compliant and I can drive in the the zone without being charged an arm and a leg.Any advice / heads up please let me know! I know it's not the most exciting car but I have had an itch for one for a while now but while wanting X5 wheels. So I have to figure that now. But hopefully some updates soon regarding the EML at least. ","December 17, 2021",BMW X3

GrantD5,"So first kind of update.I ordered a scanner from Amazon yesterday and it arrived today. Has pretty good reviews and only £25.00. Good enough to keep in the car for personal use at least.If anyone wants to the link of the one I used it is - https://amzn.to/3FrkIBDOrdered this due to the EML being on. So got to scanning and it flashed up the following.And one extra screen I found that I don't really understand, if anyone can shed some light that would be great.Moving on, I have been reading some 330i / 530i threads online and it seems a common replacement for the M54 engines can be the DISA valve.Here is a copy and paste of some issues that can arise when yours is faulty (for those that might not know)"" The symptoms of this fault are very obvious; there is a rattling noise coming from the DISA valve, SES light is lit and getting a lean mixture fault or rough running at idle. Displaying DTC codes and a loss in low end torque. There may be a rattling, buzzing or clicking noise coming from the engine. Fault codes: lean condition(P1083, P1085), front oxygen sensor lean (P1090, P1092) oxygen sensor slow response (P1087, P1089) and cylinder misfire (P0311-P0316) fuel control mixture lean (bank 2 sensor 1) and p0174 system too lean, showing? ""So that pretty much matches my issues.So I have ordered one for £64.99 and will pay my friend to fit it for me, I don't want my hands dirty haha. Looks like a nice bit of kit and they have their own install guide video.It removes the faulty plastic unit setup and replaces it with a billet aluminum setup.Anyway, I have started my pence per mile table that I have used previously and will get that updated soon once I pay for the part to be fitted.The dealer has agreed to pay half the bill which I am happy with just to get it over and done with, I am happy with the car apart from this issue so it will be nice to carry on driving.MOT history also states it has an oil leak so will start looking in to that and make sure its kept topped up in the mean time.Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 ","December 19, 2021",BMW X3

C70R,"The DISA valve failing should be VERY obvious, with a pronounced tapping/rattling from the inlet manifold on idle. You can test for it by disconnecting power to the valve's solenoid while the engine is running, which should make the noise stop - there's a good YT video showing how to do that.Your EML issues are likely to be linked to sensor of some sort. O2 and MAF sensors are the most common culprits.Also, don't rule out a tear in the intake trunk (from the airbox to the inlet manifold), which lets a load of unmetered air in and causes the car to run poorly. Easy to check, cheap and simple to replace. ","December 20, 2021",BMW X3

You can check the vacuum under the oil cap with the engine running to give yourself a good idea of the CCV health.Remove the cap, and place your hand over the hole - a slight sucking feeling (and small change in idle) is normal, but strong suction suggests that the CCV has had it.Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 Jhonno said: Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 ","December 20, 2021",BMW X3

GrantD5,"So its been a fun start to 2022, a few questions on the Facebook pages!So I noticed the start up was a little sluggish. But thought nothing much of it and wanted to wait until after the DISA valve was replaced, so we will start there.Ordered and X8R DISA valve kit and it was a very nice piece of kit!But on the day of going to get it fitted, the car wouldn't start. I had left an iPhone lead plugged in over night in the 12v plug that had a red light shining all night and I thought this must of just trickled the battery down enough.This got left a couple of days now as I was busy with work etc and this is kind of a second car. Anyway a couple of days later, I jump started the car and it worked fine so I took it for a spin around the block. Later that evening I took it to another friends too have the DISA valve fitted.All was good, the car started and I drove home and it drove better with the new valve in place.I went to the car in the morning to take it to work, NOTHING. Again this got left a couple of days, tested the battery and it was on the orange light at 12v and it was a 5-6 year old Bosch unit, but because it started up when jumping I decided to buy a new battery. Couple of days later and £140 later I jump started the car and took it to Halfords and had a new Yuasa battery fitted.New battery in and the car started, just. Anyway, I had some time to kill and went for some break with with my mother before heading to work, came out of McDonalds and NOTHING the car wouldn't start. The car was recovered and dropped a couple miles back home.I had some recommendations for the earth straps which I have bought now (still not fitted just yet), but tried to start the car with the car earthed with a jump lead with no luck. These are going to be changed soon anyway as they are cheap enough and appear to be problematic.With the new battery in though, and trying to start the car and you could hear the starter having a tough time. Great.For those who don't know the starter is under the inlet on these M54 engines. So while this was being done I decided to replace the CCV system with a kit from C3BMW. This was all fitted today. I also got a little dehumidifier pouch as the car steams up on the windscreen a fair bit inside.Here are some fitting photos from today, was a bit of a pain getting the inlet off, didn't really find much online for getting the inlet off from an X3 M54 but got there in the end.The sonofabeech. It was spinning freely. And original.Didn't get any photos of the new CCV kit fitted but its all fitted and the old pipes were very brittle. The car is all back together and it was a relief to hear it start up first time once all back together.It was evident that the oil leak is coming from the Vanos leak so the inlet will be coming back off very soon to have this replaced which is annoying, but not know how to do so, this will be done along with a full service of the car.The Pounds Per Mile sheet will be updated soon, I don't even want to look currently!Some nicer updates soon hopefully and do not wish this job on anyone!

Think I am going to leave the aux belts now until I do the cooling.Still have the earth straps to fix, and I also got a replacement centre heating vent to fit as the one in the car now had a Parrot kit stuck on not very well and covered in crusty glue, so will be removing the old vent and removing the parrot kit and hopefully not much damage caused to wiring when fitted.The EML keeps coming back on now but taking it to a friend to run some live data and see whats going on and hopefully find out whats going on when the plugs are changed.

GrantD5,"Been a while since any kind of update, the car has been working fine really apart from the misfire and the car feeling a little tired. I have done just under 3500 miles since ownership. Not needed an oil top up, have had to top up the coolant once before my trip to the liverpool region and once today while having the service. Typical BMW really.Anyway, while visiting my friend in Wirral, we took a trip to watch my local team Dagenham & Redbridge play away at Altrincham. It was not worth the 3-0 defeat but I got front row parking essentially.Couple other photos since the last update.Today see the oil & filter change, air filter, pollen filter, spark plugs and HEL vanon braided pipe. Also had the Parrot kit removed and centre vent replaced.I was told upon purchase the coilpacks had been changed recently, it appears they have replaced all 6 with Bosch units.The plugs looked a little worse for wear.Replaced with some brand new like for likes.Old oil filter out. Yuck.Pollen filter. Yuck.Air filter wasn't too dirty but it felt very stiff compared to new.Vanos pipe replaced with a HEL braided unit.Finally it was time to fix a couple bits on the interior, I removed some glue from the internal side of the windscreen from permit stickers etc. I also had the Parrot kit removed FINALLY, it had been dangling around since the early days of ownership, and I also replaced the centre vent. The new centre vent has silver tips on the vent adjusters, so I am assuming this is from a facelift, so I am going to try and get the sides to match now, definitely looks a little nicer for me anyway.There was a lot of wiring to come out!And a photo to end the day off.The car needs a massive clean especially after that Sahara sand landing here, and the engine bay can now be cleaned after it's had a service.Next up I think will be a rear parking sensor replacement as it is killing me, the beep alone when going in to reverse grinds me.

The X5 is great, I feel bad having neglected her due to the lockdown, but as a family of 5 (with one of those massive twin buggy things) was concerned about space for the weekly shop (I've forgotten what that is in the past 8 weeks )Has to be the new one, Euro6 to keep free of the Sadiq Khan Surcharge (ULEZ), a bit easier to park than my current car, with reversing cameras, and the 3 litre straight six diesel. I have had mine on finance for almost a year, decent enough credit history, but unsure about flipping cars like these Youtubers do.No great hurry to change, but was weighing it up. Dealing with settlement fees might be an issue though, and don't want to be paying through the nose for a smaller car. Hasn't the tax thing also changed or is that just on brand new cars?This thread is just what I needed. So basically was originally looking between F-Pace and X5, but my wife was a bit concerned on the size of the X5 as it is massive, is the X3 worth a crack then? It was out of that or the F-Pace originally and whilst I prefer the look of the F-Pace, heard some of the tech is poor and that's where BMW excels.Any thoughts on the X3 Hybrid that has recently dropped? Do you lose boot space? Just worry it doesn't have enough muscle underneath to really move the size of the car. CourtAgain said: ","June 05, 2020",BMW X3

Ride slightly bouncy with standard suspension and 17"" wheels. Standard lights are a little disappointing after being used to Xenons.However, all of the above can be remedied with a higher spec 6cyl car - just factor increased depreciation with the new X3 due later this year.A great car overall and objectively, one I'll find very hard to justify replacing.

If you want to keep it simple then insist on a HP (regular car loan) and I’m sure they’ll still do you something as that’s got to be better than cash. Then complete paperwork, pay for deposit, take car and within 14 days exercise your right to withdraw from the agreement. That way you benefit from the best price (assuming they’ve done that in exchange for your taking out BMW finance) but you can then choose to pay as you like - cheaper loan, cash etc. You call the BMW FS and exercise your right to withdraw, then pay up using a debit card.

MarkGArgyle,"SouthSide92 said:How did it go in the end Mark? Did you managed to haggle them down at all?Hi, no further luck in Cardiff, they were simply not interested in getting the business so I held out and went to Staffordshire to pick up the car. It had more miles (17k on a 2020 plate if I recall), not sure how they managed that in a pandemic but it was a good deal as I work from home so the car pretty much remains doing the kids runabouts during the week before it get it back for the weekends. I have had it since May and it is now on 22k.All went well, it had 4 new tyres which was a pleasant surprise given they are 21” rfts, apart from getting a speeding ticket that day (zoom awareness course sorted that) and they forgot to service it which was a surprise…all sorted at my local dealer with the supplying dealer picking up the tab.It is averaging around 19-21mpg round town and will do approx 32mpg on a run which I think is pretty fair considering the performance and pops/bangs which are quite comical for a family suv and makes me smile still today. I have seen as low as 11mpg when stretching its legs though but you should not think about fuel cost with one of these.Finally the only sour point was that both my son and myself were thrown BMW motorsport coats also as part of the deal, despite many chases and promises they still didn’t show up. I have not given up though!Some gratuitous shots, seats are fantastic as (re)posted above.It is currently worth approx what I paid for it on wbac.Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 SouthSide92 said: Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49 Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 ","December 13, 2021",BMW X3

Guvernator,"I can think of 3 advantages of an SUV over an estate off the top of my head.1) Better visibility. The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.

Kitchski,"Guvernator said:I'm not a fan of SUV's either but for the purposes of getting an average family from A to B they really are one of the best options due to stuff already stated above, well it's either that or an MPV! So all the scorn on PH, either the majority of PH'ers are rich bachelor singletons or powerfully built company directors who pack the kids off to boarding school or let the nanny kart the kids around so don't have to worry about the practicalities of moving kids around.The SUV is still no-where near as good as an MPV at carting the brood around. You'd struggle to get three decent kids car seats across the back of that, so unless you've got two kids or less, you'd still be better off in an MPV. And if you've got two kids or less, a normal saloon or estate would do the job fine. We've only got an S-Max because one of our kids split into two before they were born, the cheeky feckers.Some people who care too much how others perceive them might insist on trying to cram everything into a tool less-suited to the job, but the MPV is just made for families, pure and simple.

Then you add in the other advantages, much more room for a dog, tow capacity which is genuinely useful, ground clearance to take it down unclassified tracks across the moors, four wheel drive to make that less of a worry.I do miss the style of the Alfa and if I'm being badge conscious I miss owning a modern everyday Alfa, so the Stelvio makes a lot of sense in my world.

Evilex,"nickfrog said:The thought process is simple. They tend to be a better functional alternative for transport than traditional estates or saloons for many people. They're slightly shorter than an ""equivalent"" estate yet offer similar interior space ; they offer a higher driving position which is brilliant for visibility, touring, ease of access. They tend to have taller sidewalls and longer travel suspension which is a good combo for comfort.They are dynamically superb despite the high COG but won't quite match a lower car, which is no big deal as they're not track cars. They use a little more fuel which is offset by better residuals. No downsides IME.

The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.4. 4WD with no transmission tunnel.OK, only the X5 , Discovery and Range Rovers do this .. but gives loads more interior space Guvernator said: ","March 01, 2017",Alfa Romeo Stelvio

Kolbenkopp,"nickfrog said:So zero real world downsides and loads of real world benefits (comfy ride, easier access, better visibility, smaller physical footprint). For family use, the choice is simple, despite the ghastly image and the PH scienceI'm a convicted SUV disbeliever, but over time I've come to accept them. With the current things your practical points are just the truth. Despite the non ideal formula to start with, enough development has been thrown at them, and in the real world they work nicely. I drive one as rental every so often and mostly come out impressed (grudgingly).What IMO is unfortunate is the way marketing/demand steered manufacturers. The 4x4 image is popular, perhaps because of the active life style it portrays. So they worked hard at making tough, heavy and tall 4x4s work for families. Getting efficiency out of the formula a big challenge. End result after ~ 20 years of fettling -- cars that are basically big hatchbacks with pretty heavy suspension and inexplicably large wheels.The alternative to get the same real-world benefits could have been to fettle with the MPV formula a bit more. I think we would have gotten to better results at least decade quicker. But the MPV image? So uncool. So not much development or demand. Good thing I don't need a compact people carrier at the moment, or I would be moaning about the lack of a B-Max ST, Scenic RS or Sportsvan GTI/GTD .Or to put it another way, a 33 year old car like this one:Hypothetically updated to current levels of reliability and crash safety.

Guvernator,"big_rob_sydney said:You do realise how illogical that is, right?There are god knows how many thousand parking stations already built around the country. Not to mention the various country lanes that are the width they are and wont get rebuilt with an extra few inches every time the population ""up-sizes"" due to the latest fashion-victim trend.Quite frankly, the whole door bashing thing is only going to get worse due to selfish people continually engaging in the beached whale arms race.Next thing you know, idiots will complain their car doesn't fit into ANY space. While conveniently forgetting that no one put a gun to their heads to buy the land barge in the first place...A bit like those geniuses who move next to an airport then complain about the noise. Retards.Of course roads aren't going to be rebuilt but it's pretty simple to repaint white lines for parking spaces. Cars are getting bigger, even a modern Fiesta is massive compared to the size it was 15 years ago and I really can't see this trend reversing any time soon.

nickfrog,"Kolbenkopp said:What IMO is unfortunate is the way marketing/demand steered manufacturers. The 4x4 image is popular, perhaps because of the active life style it portrays. So they worked hard at making tough, heavy and tall 4x4s work for families. Getting efficiency out of the formula a big challenge. End result after ~ 20 years of fettling -- cars that are basically big hatchbacks with pretty heavy suspension and inexplicably large wheels.The alternative to get the same real-world benefits could have been to fettle with the MPV formula a bit more. I think we would have gotten to better results at least decade quicker. But the MPV image? So uncool. So not much development or demand. Good thing I don't need a compact people carrier at the moment, or I would be moaning about the lack of a B-Max ST, Scenic RS or Sportsvan GTI/GTD .I agree with you - they fixed the SUV to make it as good as the ""monospace"" while still resembling a pseudo off-roader - they got there in the end by using hatch underpinnings but that's a strange way indeed to re-invent the wheel without making it too square !Amusingly the MPVs are now trying to look like SUVs - cue the new Scenic which is as high as Kadjar but ONLY comes with 20' wheels when the Kadjar can be bought with 17's!!

aspender,"Practicality:Boot is a very reasonable size, nice and square and with no loading lip. We can pretty much everything we need for a 5-day trip to center parcs into it (e.g. buggy, large suitcase, trunki, then stuff packed around them. Back seats are fine for car seats and the isofix points are very well done (small plastic flap to lift up, no hunting around to find them) rear space isn't amazing. I have the drivers seat fairly far back and there's still room for an adult behind me, but it isn't expansive. Headroom in the back is fine. I have the pano sunroof which makes it quite airy back there too. However without pano, with privacy glass and the swooping line of the roof I can image that it might feel a bit more claustrophobic than it actually is. There are two USB charging points for the back seats but they don't connect to the infotainment.In the front things are all good. Seats (Milano Edizione ones) are good and well adjustable with memory. A nice touch is if the drivers seat is set forward of the B pillar it will automatically move back to allow easy ingress/egress when the engine is switched off. There's USB on the center console and in the glovebox. I have a mini-USB stick of the daughters music in the glovebox permanently attached and still use the console one for charging my phone. The climate control feeds directly into the glovebox but tbh I've never found a use for this. Two good cupholders (concealable) in the centre console along with a useful phone slot between them. Glovebox is very small. Door storage is fine.We cycle a lot. I didn't spec the roof rails but do have Whispbar roof bars and a couple of bike carriers which fit fine and actually look pretty good. It's not such a high car that getting bikes on/off the top is too difficult.Driving:All very subjective... but for an SUV it is definitely fast enough! If you want to drive it spiritedly it will play ball. Of course if really pushed then the laws of physics come into play, it is still a high vehicle with a bit more weight, but overally the reviews rightly laud the drive dynamics. Steering is fast but I've not found that it is too fidgety like some reviews say. Conversely when you just want to get from A-B the car is just a nice place to trundle along in. The gearbox never misses a beat in full auto mode. DNA selector is 95% of the time in 'N' for me with occassional 'D' and never 'A' unless there's snow. There is a marked difference in throttle responsiveness and gear selection between 'N' and 'D' but for everyday driving with 'N' you can just downshift with the paddles to execute an overtake etc. Engine noise is what you might expect from a 4-pot turbo but after a while it has got a bit more tuneful.MPG is... well thirsty. In 12k miles I've averaged around 24mpg. A long motorway drive might get 30 or so.Other stuff:Had a few niggles covered by warranty - filler cap tends to warp and stick out a bit. Alarm can be over-sensitive and needs adjusting. I've only had one significant mechanical that required the ABS pump to be replaced. AEB can be a bit over-keen in warning you of impending doom e.g. when turning near oncoming traffic (but doesn't kick in)Mostly though, it is still a very unusual car to see around and 18 months in I still get a kick every time I look at it or drive it ","April 28, 2019",Alfa Romeo Stelvio
Yidwann,"I'm glad it's not just mine on the fuel.... was starting to wonder, it is indeed thirsty, but I love mine, in a sea of German tin, its nice to have something a bit different, and the cabin is still a very nice place to sit. The infotainment sits in CarPlay most of the time. Its certainly not lacking pace and the engine not is a bit more raspy and tuneful the VAG 4 pot I came from.I have had mine for about a month... genuinely not seen another one on my travels yet.

They do look stunning though, congrats on your purchase!Will be happy to report back. I've only done 200 miles of fairly gentle driving so far as the run-in period says to keep under 5k rpm until 300 miles and under 70mph, plus it isn't going in for detailing/ceramic coating until next week.One other consideration on 280 vs QF is a really quite significant different in insurance groups. The Stelvio QF is group 50 (by comparison the Giulia QF is ""only"" 46). Tax is also a jump from £540 per year to £2,175 per year (plus the first 5 years surcharge which is applicable to both) Yidwann said: ","October 20, 2020",Alfa Romeo Stelvio
aspender,"Van Dessel said:Hi Aspender congrats on the upgrade! I'm also deciding on 280HP vs.QF (both used). Are you looking for more power per se or really just more sound, fury and occasion?Sound and occasion hits the nail on the head. The 280 is plenty powerful and fast enough for any day to day activity. I can't say I ever found it wanting. The QF for me is ticking off a few boxes on the bucket list. I've had a V6 before but not one like this - I just wanted that 500+ HP, sound, delivery, Ferrari connotations etc and it was a case of just being very fortunate enough to be able to do so. Of course general wisdom would say I should have gone with the Giulia QF but for our family needs the Stelvio is a better match.Van Dessel said:Are you looking used or new? The new list prices are so high (you can't really stay under £50k for a nice 280HP) that a used QF with 3000-5000 miles on the clock looks like a good deal....Thanks for your thoughtsHaving owned an early one without the inital round of improvements (most notably Carplay/Android Auto) and now a MY20 I wouldn't say that the MY20 updates transform the car. Yes the infotainment is better (the performance pages are actually quite useful) the driver assistance stuff works well etc, but fundamentally it's the same overall driving and cabin experience and the mechanicals are not really much different (on the Stelvio QF there are engine changes, notably the introduction of both direct and port injection to avoid the need for a GPF. There's also a rumour of a 1.5cm lower ride height)If you can get second hand with Carplay/Android Auto, I'd say that would be a great car regardless.

Stelvio never even crossed my mind.If I was to need a mid size SUV as a normal bread & butter vehicle, an extra half a second to get to 60 and 2 fewer cylinders wouldn't be on my mind.I would, however, prefer something that is half decent looking. The X3 M40i misses that criteria by a long shot. The Macan S might just make it onto the list, several places down from the Stelvio.Do you live at Santa Pod? If not, then 0-60 is irrelevant.What you do get is a far nicer engine that will be more drivable with that extra overtake punch. If I wanted a 4-pot engine, then yes the Stelvio would be a consideration between that, a Macan T and an X3 2.0.My point was Alfa have room to include a Macan S rivalling power output with a nice V6. But then it would be far more expensive that the Macan S. Justin-ow582 said: Wab1974uk said: ","May 08, 2023",Alfa Romeo Stelvio

Julian Scott,"Read this with interest as I replaced a Giulia Quadrifoglio last year with a (new) F-Pace SVR - one of the prime rivals the article cites, and interestingly I found and commented on the Stelvio Vs SVR thread only yesterday - https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...I’ve only seen two Grecale in the flesh, neither the Trofeo obviously, and it’s actually better looking than the pictures foretell, but it’s also not overly distinctive, although perhaps appropriately so for a Maserati.Dropping the new 530bhp Maserati V6 into this car makes for an alluring proposition and had the ingredients to fight with the best. The article even gives the impression that it succeeds to a good level, as whilst it plays second fiddle to the hottest Macan and F-Pace SVR in two specific areas, they also cite that they are high bars to reach, and that the Maserati betters the others in the segment.The one glaring issue is its price point. I bought my SVR last September, brand new but a stock car. Its RRP was just under £88k with a decent level of options. I paid a smudge over £75k cash. What’s more, my car comes with (either standard or the optional extras fitted) all of the £8k of options the test car has, plus more, although with the exception of full matrix LED headlight (I have standard LEDs).I’m sure there will be wriggle room in the Maserati’s price, but the optioned car is over £30k more than I paid and £20k over RRP. Hell of a premium for a Maserati.But, whilst I’m sure the notion of 500bhp+ smaller SUVs makes the blood boil of the driving supremos on here, but as an actual customer in that market, combining entertainment with the practicality medium sized SUVs offers is a welcome market development.

BigR,"Quite a Maserati fan (on my 5th, and second Levante). I saw these in the flesh at FoS and have to say that the front is really quite plain and sadly Ford Puma-like. The rest actually looks perfectly decent in the flesh, but that lets it down and isn't enough in tune with 'Maserati' or their sense of slightly different / daring / style.Then, the price of these is pretty rich. The Levante Trofeo is not very much more at all (perhaps £110k in reality), and you get more car for it. If it had a better looking front end and perhaps more of an £80k price tag, it'd stand more of a chance and be a more compact viable alternative to the Levante (which is bloody big).That said, we're all looking at it from our (largely) UK perspective. No idea what their sales spread is across the rest of Europe / world to know whether this will land better elsewhere.As to the comment around digging around for the dealers, this is a bit of a problem too. Maranello is the nearest for me and utterly the most incapable / duplicitous / outright lying dealer (sales and service) of any brand I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Fortunately I live tolerably close enough to another, however, it is a bit of an issue. Equally, it's not a mass-market car, but hell I hope it sells well enough to keep some of the traction going, supporting the ability to build the more exciting stuff such as the MC20 and GranTurismo (in much the same way that Lamborghini or whoever else gets often slated for building SUV's, but they sustain the other products and ensure a viable future for the business).

Its now almost impossible to safely drive a low sports car at night because headlights are very bright now and mounted increasingly higher up on the common SUV's. Even when driving a normal saloon car your eyes are typically now at the same level as oncoming lights. The only safe solution is to raise your eye level above the oncoming headlights. Since its very dangerous to drive with your head out of the sunroof with stilts strapped to your feet, a small SUV is the only remaining option.As long as these small SUV's retain the upright driving position, and are all approx the same dimensions, the status quo will be restored.","February 16, 2022",Maserati Grecale

ducnick,"With these sorts of cars I wish the reviewers would essentially ignore the halo model bought by the 1%.What we seem to have is a 2 litre, fairly dull small suv just like all the other 2l dull SUV’s. I can’t imagine the vw Tiguan or Audi Q5 /bmw x3/Merc /jag etc etc is any better or worse when it comes to the dull powertrain. They are all dull because they are boring 2 litre four bangers in a brick outhouse.So move onto the other differentiating factors.Is the interior better or worse than the competition? Well it sounds pretty infuriating to me from the review. Certainly no match for proper door handles and buttons in a bmw, but probably about average for the market sector.How about the exterior styling? It looks to me like a big ford kuga with some Maserati badges. The whole thing looks very transverse front wheel drive with a cab forward design. Probably good for interior space, but it’s not a good looker to me.Price? I bet that will be competitive.Dealer experience/reliability … it’s a maserati, when I had one you wouldn’t venture near Britains only dealer, but I’m sure they must have improved now. In the PCP world this probably isn’t a factor.It’s going to be a very hard sell in a market dominated by German brands with wide dealer networks and big advertising budgets.

hornbaek,"GT3hopeful said:Joeogilvie said:I traded from a Macan to a new StelvioQF last summer - there’s no question as to the better interior quality and sense of solidity in the Macan, but the StelvioQF masks it’s weight far better, and even compared to the more sporty cars in my garage, is fun to drive.The Macan has extremely high residuals, and probably presents the most economic option, but the standard kit on a StelvioQF is impressive and you don’t have to spend big on options - that’s not always taken into account when Macan residuals are being discussed.I considered a Levante, but it was too dated and dynamically weak compared to the StelvioQF, though it’s hard not to find the brand appealing. If the Grecale had been available when I bought the StelvioQF last year, I’d definitely have considered it, but I suspect it would have to have been substantially better dynamically to justify the premium over the StelvioQF.I’m looking for a replacement for my Range Rover SC 5.0 and agee with the above. I would want a smaller car as the RR is too big for driving around Milan and I saw the Grecale in the flesh and it looked good. I think it’s main feature (The Trofeo) is that it is not a Mecan GTS and that it is nicer inside than the Stelvio which in my opinion is let down by some cheap materials inside the cabin.+1","April 03, 2022",Maserati Grecale

It was watered down and did not drive neatly as well, the facelift car has different suspension components, no carbon roof as standard etc etc. They changed the setup to reduce wheel skip when cold, but the facelift was far less satisfying and fun to drive for me. Mine was a 2017 car. Facelift from 2020 in the Alfa.The SVR I ended up with by surprise, I tried a C63S and an F90 M5 and found the Merc disappointing and the M5 just dull.The SVR is a very practical and great everyday car, with good luxury. But the surprising thing is how much character it has, obviously it sounds great, has instant thrust, and the handling is fun and the control inputs nicely weighted. The SVR is such a great all round and fun everyday car, and obviously good in all weathers unlike the Alfa.

ducnick,"One of my neighbours has got one already.. oh no it’s a Ford kuga, but they look so similar.There is a fairly complex equation that determines how good looking a car can be. It’s based on size, height, number of doors, number of seats, luggage capacity etc. as a car becomes more practical it becomes harder to design it to look good. Let’s face it, any school kid could sketch a good looking gt car. Try sketching a good looking car that seats 5, has 4 doors, can fit in a U.K. parking space with room to open the door etc it’s hellishly complicated by the packaging requirements of transverse engine, fwd etc.When designing a gt car the designer may features from the stylistic toolbox eg flying buttresses, double bubble roof , coke bottle hips etc to create a pleasing silhouette, that doesn’t work when designing a small crossover. Packaging necessities result in them all looking basically the same. All you can do is resort to different grille, non functional vents etc to differentiate them.Edited by ducnick on Tuesday 22 March 21:08","March 22, 2022",Maserati Grecale
