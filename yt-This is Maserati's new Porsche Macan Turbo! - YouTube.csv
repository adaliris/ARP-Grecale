1,I’ve actually seen pre production models at Egham Maserati and it is probably one of the most comfortable cars I’ve ever sat in and beautifully made. The only issues I have are with the front headlamps which should be more like the Levante and was told the service intervals were 9000 miles! Otherwise a superb car and far more character than a Macan.,"

100,"Pretty disappointed in the front end looks. Maserati’s usually have great front ends and the Levante is one of the best in the SUV class, but this one just looks off, and has the Macan style bug eye headlights but with worse proportions. The Alpha is still the best looking compact and I’d take the Macan over this for looks as well. The x4 is worse, but I’ve never been a fan of their designs. Would be interesting to see what it’s like in the interior/to drive. The Levante is a mixed bag inside, with some awesome leathers but also some mediocre plastics and electronics. If this can iron out those issues, it could be one of the better interiors. The Alpha is the most fun to drive in this class imo, even if the Macan is objectively a better handling vehicle. If this can replicate the Alpha but with more features and a better interior, it could be really great (despite the front end). Hard not to get a Porsche if you were actually buying one though, just for reliability.","

Honestly, strap on a different badge and it could be a Ford. Also I like how the new Gran Turismo looks almost the same as the old one - which is good, because it would be very hard to improve on that design, it was a beautiful car. I'd much rather have a burbly 200hp V8 than that 1200hp electric motor though.","
