mwcltd,My dealer could get no sense out of Audi UK sales when they were called. They then sent an email and got some answers. My Q5 has been built but there are some parts that need to be fitted but are not in stock. I have no more details and I am not sure if this is caused because my Q5 is a 55 tfsi e Competition which has now been removed from the UK price list.

K76,Ordered a Q5 Competition 55 on the 1st of November 2021 in Daytona grey thinking that 6 months would be plenty of time as my lease on current Audi was ending in May 2022. Was recently given a 41 build week from my dealer and will be lucky to get the car this year.,"May 20, 2022"

gw82,"After chasing the dealer again I was told yesterday it was at port of exit, released. I am assuming this is Emden, not Mexico and therefore at status 38. Progress but current car is due a service in 30 days so race against time to avoid unnecessary costs. For info I ordered mine in August.","May 23, 2022"
mwcltd,Thank you gw82 for the update. What flavour Q5 did you order? My understanding is that the car is shipped from Sao Paolo to Emden then on another ship to Teesside then Sheerness. My dealer tells me that from status 38 to handover is between 3 and 4 weeks. BTW due to my Q5 delays my dealer has offered to pay half the service cost.,"May 23, 2022"
gw82,"I’ve got a 55 tfsi e competition (is that the same as yours). The last time I ordered an Audi (non Q5) it went from Emden to Sheerness directly. Not sure if that’s changed.They’ve given me a great price for my current car and I’m trying to get them to get rid of the £1k deposit too. I can get a good price for a service as my brother used to work there and knows the manager well. Even so I’d like to avoid it!Good luck with yours, it’s frustrating. The only thing not driving me mad is that I love my current car and will miss it when it’s gone.","May 23, 2022"
mwcltd,"Snap. My Q3 went from Emden to Teesside as it is built in Gyor, Hungary. The Q5 is only built in Mexico. Audi consolidates all UK shipments in Emden. I was also given a good part exchange for my Q3 as my dealer tells me that demand exceeds supply for second hand Audi's. Seemingly new ones are difficult to get hold of.My Q3 is fantastic but I wanted something a bit bigger and hybrid. That left me with the Q5 and the Q3 hybrid is not quattro.The dealer should pay for the whole service as it has to be done before it is put on the forecourt.","May 23, 2022"
gw82,"I’ve got the S4 Avant which is actually more practical than the Q5 but I didn’t want the new version which is diesel. We have three kids so the Q7 was an option but a bit slow, bit more expensive and too big for the narrow residential streets where we live. I did briefly look at the RSQ3 but think it would have just been too small.","May 23, 2022"

Workshy,"Bulla said:It’s outstanding! A real step up from the VW Tiguan in refinement. Much quieter and smoother and a real quality feel all round. It’s such a pleasure to drive. With getting on for twice the horsepower, it feels much quicker off the mark already which will improve once properly run in.Only been for short drives so far but it feels very comfortable and will be well suited to longer trips, particularly with the adaptive cruise control.The MMI and virtual cockpit are a great size and high definition with good customisation options. The higher location of the MMI makes such an improvement to the screens usability.Very pleased with the Q5 and looking forward to going on some longer trips! 😁Click to expand...We took a trip to Cornwall from London at the weekend and had no aches when we got there and used less than half a tank each way 👍👍","June 14, 2022"

I have heard nothing for about 7 months now (ordered in November 2021).I’ll give the dealer a call to request the order number and ask Audi UK for a more detailed progress update.If I managed to get the car a month or so after you, I’d be very happy but not sure if that’ll be the case!","June 22, 2022"

mwcltd,I have had a private plate for 38 years so I am not concerned when it is registered.I have always used PCP and traded in my existing Audi. The dealer has agreed in writing that the equity on my current Q3 will not reduce from the valuation in October 2021 but I have yet to negotiate the finance rate on the Q5.,"July 1, 2022"
Workshy,It’s good to hear things are finally happening for you 👍👍,"July 8, 2022"
mwcltd,Wakefield Audi have been very good. I was concerned that in manufacturing they might have reduced some functionality due to component shortage. They have checked with production and I am getting a full fat version. To double check before registration we are going to audit the Q5 before it is registered to me and taxed in my name.,"July 9, 2022"
mwcltd,I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.,"July 26, 2023"

mwcltd,I won't have long to wait before I find out if anything is missing.,"July 11, 2022"
mwcltd,I have received an email from Audi to say that my Q5 is wrapped up and on a ship to the UK. If I get it next month it will be 10 months from order placement at Wakefield Audi.,"July 22, 2022"
Nujjy,"This is great news! I’m sure the 10-month wait will be worth it.Still getting 00 build status on my Nov 2021 order. Looks like a 10-month wait is out of the question for me. If I even get the car this year, I’ll be surprised!","July 22, 2022"
Bulla,Great news! I picked my Q5 up 14 days after receiving that email 😊,"July 22, 2022"
mattbrx,"Ordered my Q5 (My first!) on 11th April 22. Initial expected delivery date on the order form is 30 September..... I've read elsewhere that I can check the status of my order online, but can't seem to find out where - can anyone help?","July 22, 2022"
Bulla,Unfortunately the online updates of orders no longer exist. All you will get are a couple of emails at key stages from Audi U.K. For example build complete or on a ship to the U.K. Your dealer can give you a status from the system but it’s a pretty broad brush answer. Mine took 18 weeks from February to June this year but added options or specification can vary the lead time.,"July 22, 2022"
mattbrx,"Thanks - I feared that was likely the case, but thanks for clearing it up. I've had nothing from the dealer yet, so I'll have to sit tight","July 22, 2022"

SQ5_NW,"For those of you that are shortly to receive your cars, if you are taking out a PCP deal, what interest are you being charged?I ordered when the rate was 2.9% (July 2021), but when it arrived they wanted to charge me the 6.3% current at the time (April this year).After a bit of a standoff I actually signed up to 6.3% but the dealer reduced the price of the car so that my monthly payments and final price were the same as on 2.9%.Worth having a 'frank' discussion with your dealer if you are likely to be in a similar position.","July 22, 2022"
mwcltd,What a coincidence. I am about to receive my Q5 55 tfsi e in about 2 weeks. I am purchasing on PCP and I ordered the car in October 2021. My dealer has already offered further discount to make the monthly payments identical. I don't know if it helped but I have purchased Audi's from this dealer for the last 22 years.,"July 22, 2022"
Nujjy,"@mwcltd- what was the lead time between build date and delivery date?For the first time in 8 months, the status of my order has changed to an ‘estimated’ build date in mid-October.My dealer expects it to take around 4 months before it’ll then be delivered in the UK.I’m definitely glad to see the status updated but it implies a big difference in delivery timelines, considering I only ordered a month afterwards.","July 25, 2022"
mwcltd,The lead time between the actual build date and sailing from Mexico was 6 weeks. The main reason for this was component shortages. My estimated build date was initially week 4 2022. This was then confirmed to week 22 2022. The time taken from Mexico to Germany was just under 4 weeks. I should get the Q5 in under 2 weeks.,"July 25, 2022"
Nujjy,"Thanks, that’s really helpful. Hopefully I’ll get my Q5 before the year is out.Also 2 weeks is really soon, you must be excited!It’s been a long wait but it’ll be worth it.","July 25, 2022"
mwcltd,Did you order a special configuration or one with a sunroof?,"July 26, 2022"
mwcltd,I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.,"July 26, 2023"
nilsmi,It's indeed the platinum package with a sunroof and the adaptive cruise etc. However back in September (after first delay) those options were not listed as restrictive options (only the trailer hitch which I removed from the configuration to be replaced by a aftermarket one).,"July 26, 2022"
mwcltd,"In the UK over the last 2 years the sunroof has been a stop/start option. One of the reasons that the Vorsprung model was removed from the UK price list was the sunroof. Adaptive cruise was never a showstopper but it did delay certain Q5's. In the UK there isn't now a user Audi car tracker. However, your dealer or the local Audi sales office have access to the Audi sales computer where, given your Audi order number, the status can be obtained for your car. Over the last 2 years configuring an Audi has been like playing whack-a-mole.","July 26, 2022"

mwcltd,Thank you all for your support. I am going to Wakefield Audi on Monday to confirm the specification and have the Snooper cable remove from the Q3.

mwcltd,I went to inspect my new Q5 hybrid yesterday and the only item missing was the wireless charging mat which I can't use and don't care about. My sales person told me that on Q5's there were problems a year ago but these have gone with deliveries in the last 6 months. What she did say was that the big problems are with the Q3 with all sorts of functionality being removed or replaced. After checking there are no Q5 hybrid battery supply problems but there are with pure EV's. Don't be put off by the estimated build week. As it gets closer they will allocate an allocated build week which could be earlier.,"August 2, 2022"
Nujjy,Great news and glad the spec matches what you ordered!,"August 2, 2022"
Midomylo,"nilsmi said:Hi Bart, indeed landing is estimated at c. 6-8weeks after building week so if they would organize delivery based on order date this could mean indeed July 23 for your order. Hopefully, they will be able to accelerate production in the meantime. I agree the delivery/waiting time on the car is unbelievable. Please note car dealer also didn't want to commit to the Jan-23 building week (which has been in my case postponed 4x times so far (from Mar22 we are now at Mar23)) so I'm not putting much confidence in the Jan-23 explanation.Regarding the options, I went for the platinum package and additional options on driver assistance apart from exterior/interior design options/packages. The option shouldn't be blocking and/or delaying the delivery time based on the details in the system.Unfortunately, due to the exceptional long waiting time, I'm currently looking at alternative options (such as stock cars) but probably will not be a Q5 (or even maybe not an Audi :-( ) as audi BE import does not give or provide any temporary solution/compensation for the increasing delivery time. I'm currently on a short-term rental and it's getting quite expensive....Click to expand...Hi Nils,Seems your configuration matches more or less mine.Do you know as from when you can cancel your order (meaning after how many time, when the delay goes overdue, from the ETA mentioned by order) is that 3 or 6 months or...?Have a similar situation, my current lease ends November this year, this would mean that I have to find an intermediate solution for 8 months, do not know if I am willing to wait that long.BR/Bart","August 2, 2022"
pauly69,"Pleased to see some UK guys are getting their hybrids soon. Those EU deliveries are outrageously delayed, no way I could wait that long.Personally, I have given up after 8 months and still no estimated build week - order cancelled.I have now ordered a Mazda CX60 so will save a chunk of £££ vs the 55 Vorsprung too. Maybe back to Audi when I go full BEV, we'll see.","August 2, 2022"
mwcltd,"Everyone has had issues with Q5's delivered from the production line. The dealer can only tell you what Audi tell them. When you ordered your Q5 did your dealer give you a tentative manufacturing date? Audi know from experience that from the factory to the dealer takes between 6 and 8 weeks. There is no point in wasting energy as regards the Q5. Nothing you say or do will accelerate the process. The Audi dealers can sell every new car they can get hold of so this is not leverage. So, you either wait, find a Q5 in stock or go to another manufacturer who will have exactly the same problems as Audi. The dealer will not care if they have to give a small amount of compensation due to late delivery or cancellation as they will make this back on the next purchaser of your Q5.","August 2, 2022"

Nujjy,Did you collect your car this week? How is it and has it been worth the wait?,"August 5, 2022"
mwcltd,"I collected the car late yesterday and its magic. The handover by Wakefield Audi was perfect, everything I asked for was fitted. I drove back to North Leeds as an EV and it was weird with no engine noise. At least I had the superb instrumentation to tell me everything. When I got back I had 1 mile of battery left. I charged until full and it took 2hrs 28mins. The car is so quiet and smooth helped by the 45 profile tyres as I had 40's on the Q3. I am still in learning mode but I am almost there. Was it worth the wait? Definitely, it is not a bigger Q3 as it is not as sporty and dynamic but it is significantly smoother and quieter with considerably more room.","August 5, 2022"
Bulla,Congratulations! Enjoy your new Q5 - they are quite different to the Q3. 😃,"August 5, 2022"
mattbrx,Update from the Audi Factory today - the lovely automated one they send out. My Q5 was booked in at time of order (April 2022) for build week 33 (which is next week).

mattbrx,Oh dear - that doesn’t sound good. I’m assuming that all the Q5’s are made in the same Mexican factory…. Have you had one from AudiUk rather than the dealer giving you any update?,"August 9, 2022"
K76,I believe they are all made in the same factory. Update was from the dealer which allegedly came from Audi UK.

There are a few new Q5's available in the UK from organisations who have forward ordered. The Q5 production is working as flat out as they can bearing in mind component shortages attributed to Covid-19. If you are thinking about cancelling then you are not committed to the brand or the product.

mwcltd,I have a Q5 55 tfsi e. From ordering at the UK Audi dealer to me collecting the car from the dealer took just over 10 months. The build status defines where the build process is. This can be obtained by your dealer as they have access to the Audi manufacturing site.,"October 14, 2022"
Catcat1111,I ordered Jan 2022 with Nationwode Vehicle Contracts and have a build date of June 2023!,"October 14, 2022"

Catcat1111,Forgot to mention mine is a 55 TFSIe,"October 14, 2022"
mwcltd,"I ordered mine 20th October 2021 and got it 4th August 2022. Count yourself lucky as Q3's are not just late on delivery but have some fairly fundamental bits missing. All my Q5 had missing was the phone charging mat which is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard. All I can say is now I have got mine, it was well worth waiting for.","October 14, 2022"
K76,"You have been lucky or had a good dealer and agree that should be well worth waiting for but at the moment myself and others this car (Q55 Competition) is an non existent car in the UK, Audi need to come clean and confirm that they will supply. I have my doubts.They can’t make the war in the Eastern Europe as an excuse for a car built in Mexico.","October 14, 2022"
Bulla,Looks great! Enjoy!,"October 15, 2022"
mwcltd,"That's a great colour. Are there any bits missing? I don't have the phone charging mat. Now the manual, good bedtime reading.","October 15, 2022"
TPD,I have had an update to say it will be moving into status twenty in the next couple of weeks and should be built month end. I have been advised its 12 weeks from this point and they are expecting to have the car at the dealership in January. I really hope this is worst case,"October 16, 2022"
mwcltd,I am getting eventually my first Q5. Could someone please tell me what the approximate lead time is from the Sao Paulo plant to the UK dealer.,"July 26, 2023"
Bulla,Shame about the rattle but they are great cars! Mine still makes me smile every time I drive it! I never use Apple Carplay but find the Audi satnav pretty good with the Google Maps overlay. Have you tried the different drive select settings as they seem to make a difference to the feel of the steering?,"October 17, 2022"
mattbrx,"I only really use the Apple Carplay for Spotify really, I'll have a fiddleI've stiffened up the steering a little in the Individual settings. it has stiffened a bit, but doesn't make a difference to the slight oversteer. Just something to get used toAwaiting a callback from the service team to book in for the loose thing..","October 17, 2022"
mwcltd,When the status is 38 it means that your Q5 is on the dock ready to be shipped. From then it is 6 to 8 weeks until you collect it.,"October 17, 2022"
mattbrx,"Audi are taking it back for a couple of days next week to have a look at the screw thing. They fear it won't be a while you wait, so they've sorted me a courtesy car for 3 days. Fingers crossed it's an easy fix - but I think they'll have to take the seat out to get to whatever it is. Still - 10 days with the car now, and still loving it. Had a couple of decent runs out in it as well as pottering round town, one of those was a 65 mile round trip to Brighton in that horrendous wind and rain the other night - the car purred along beautifully, sure footed and felt planted on the road. Got about 41mpg out of it too which I thought was OK. About 6 miles of local roads, 5 miles of country lanes, and the rest (54 miles-ish) was fairly decent A roads.","October 25, 2022"
TPD,Still waiting to hear if mine is getting built this week. It's week build 43 and still unconfirmed!,"October 25, 2022"
mwcltd,"Bet you your Q5 is in for less than a day. It is a solid fault and to take the seat out/in takes less than half an hour. You won't get real mpg figures until its logically run in, usually about 10k miles.,","October 25, 2022"

TPD,Has anyone had any previous issues where the car is waiting for shipment to the UK? Mine was built 31/10/2022 and was called off from factory stock to Transport on 01/11/2022 however I am told it is still awaiting shipment to the UK. Has anyone had any similar time frames? A month seems like an incredible amount of time just to wait for shipping.Thanks in advance,"December 1, 2022"
Bulla,I got annoyed when I was told mine was still waiting for a ship in Mexico but it turned out it was actually waiting for a ship in Germany.,"December 1, 2022"
rustynail,My order went in on the system 4th April and it is due to arrive with me on 9th December.According to the dealer it was built in week 39 (September 26th) and arrived at the supplying dealer on the 21st November so just over 8 weeks from factory to dealer.,"December 1, 2022"
Nujjy,"I think it takes about 2 months to go from build to then be ready for collection.My Q5 55 TFSIe was built on 03/10/2022 and I'm going to collect it from Audi tomorrow.Given that your car has to go from Mexico to Germany to the UK and the finally to the dealership, I'd say you've got about another 4 weeks until you'll be able to get your car.","December 2, 2022"
Nujjy,"mattbrx said:I've only had three emails since my order was placed. Order placed on 11th April 2022. At time of order, estimated delivery date was 30th September.First email from Audi was from the Factory on 9th August 22, telling me that it was 'in build' and was about to start the build phase. Second email from Audi was on 25th August telling me the final checks had been done, and that it would soon be leaving the Factory. Third email was today, telling me it was already on a ship from Emden to the UK. So I think it was 5 weeks and 1 day from when they told me the build had finished to being on a ship to the UK. Have checked with my dealer and he has told me it will land in the UK tomorrow, and they expect it at the dealership on or around Tues 12th to Thurs 14th October. I'm collecting it on Saturday 15th October.So -Order > build start - about 14 weeks.Build time / time in factory - about 2 weeksLeave Factory > Emden - about 4.5 weeksEmden > UK > to me - about 2 weeks.So - 'In Build' email to collection date - 9 weeks and 4 days.Hope this helpsClick to expand...Thanks once again for this post, mattbrx.My Q5 journey has been pretty much exactly the same (10 weeks and 1 day from the 'In Build' email to collection date) so a good indication for other people.","December 2, 2022"

Andyr100,"we had the ‘build and checks completed‘ email from Audi today, so I’m assuming it has - or is about to - be heading off from Mexico to Germany before heading to the UK.The dealer rang about an hour later and suggested it should be with them in 6-8 weeks, if it arrives at the very end of Feb we‘ll probably take delivery at the beginning of March just for the new-plate.it’s getting closer","January 6, 2023"
ScottyUK,Just ordered and got told latest lead time is 17-22 weeks. I've spec'ed a towbar and there's no date on that so it could have big effect or none. No one knows currently.,"January 29, 2023"

aaron,"Great to hear some good news about build weeks coming forward.I may be wrong but I think the largest determinant of lead times overall is the engine choice. Far less time for TDI or TFSI; as I have a TFSIe on order, it means it's a looooooooong wait for me!","March 24, 2023"

mwcltd,"You are experiencing lousy customer service. I ordered a 55 tfsi e and from order to delivery to me it took 10 months. The dealer can directly access the Audi customer sales computer and get you within a few minutes a build status.

The only item not supplied was the wireless charging pad which I would not use anyway.","March 30, 2023"
ScottyUK,If I was in your situation I'd be talking to the Audi HQ of the relevant country rather than just a franchise dealer. That's not on.If mine turns up with key items missing e.g. matrix lights then I'll simply reject it.,"March 30, 2023"

ScottyUK,Confirmed date : on my '23 build that only arrived 9 days before the build date.No OLEDs either for you but plenty in the budget to cover the differences if you really want (except air suspension of course).It worked out OK for me.

TomKAudi1,"Chunx4t said:I was aware that the ride in the SQ5 was firm especially on 21"" wheels, and have to admit during my test drive I was more interested in testing the launch control and giving it the berries and on that alone the salesman didn't have to try too hard, anyway I was happy with the suspension from Comfort to Dynamic, the good lady not so much, she compared the ride to being ""as bad"" as my son's Evo and Type R from years ago. So being the doting husband I read many forums and car sites for a simple resolve, so bought her a set of 20's for her birthday...you can imagine her surprise. Anyway got them fitted and tried them out and the difference is overwhelmingly marginal, although on the positive side it is slightly less bone shaking, less chance of kerbing and potholes and driver annoying speed bumps are less of a challenge. I hope you find this review useful and save yourself a few quid by not buying a set of 20"" wheels for your wife's birthday.

New member here, and joined to ask the experts and owners of Q5's and SQ5's a serious questionYesterday my son hit a kerb, prob doing no more than 40 mph as had just come away from a set of traffic lights, in his SQ5, relatively side on and his front alloy completely snapped, causing the car to skid along the road as the wheel had completely come off. His rear wheel had dents and scuffs, but no more damage. Is this usual, as I cannot see a great deal of evidence of alloys actually snapping clean off.I have photos of this if anyone wants further details, but as he has only had the car 3 weeks, so maybe there may have been previous damage to the wheel. He bought the car from one of the largest Audi dealers in London and not some back street dealer... hopefully you guys can shed some light on this.","July 10, 2023"
missile,Welcome to our forumIs this an OEM wheel?Audi alloy wheels are quite strong and it takes considerable impact to break them.Not sure what advice you are looking for?It would be difficult to prove wheel was previously damaged​Unreasonable to expect dealer to replace the wheels (& tyres).​​Sh1t happens​,"July 9, 2023"
Reggiep,"Just wondering if anyone had ever seen this before.... know that dealer cannot be held accountable, but hope that they would be as shocked as I was that this would break, and look into where it came from, and do something if even to spare their reputation. Looking to ask insurance company to test the wheel, for previous cracks etc, as you say sh1t happens, but paying 35k plus for a car you'd expect the wheels not to snap, being an Audi alloy... maybe a cheap fake yes, but not a genuine Audi...","July 9, 2023"

Do not let the items out of your possession until obtained. Continuity is vital. This will provide the necessary evidence for any claim.

missile,"In a former life, I did failure investigation. I would start with a close examination of the fracture faces. This may reveal evidence of casting defects, prior cracking or failure as the result of a single event.","July 9, 2023"
Richard_Lincoln,"An interesting calculation is to examine the weight of the vehicle, multiplied by the speed to assess the impact force on the rim of the wheel, spread over perhaps 6 or so square inches. The kinetic force would be likely in excess of the manufacturers specification of manufature.Imagine an alloy wheel, fixed at the centre having a 75 ton weight pressed on the rim. Or a 2+ ton weight dropped at 40 mph on the rim. I cannot imagine many manufacturers alloy wheels would be expected to do anything other than snap.Another parameter I have just thought of is the diameter of the rim. The larger size would increase the torsional stress on the spokes.","July 10, 2023"

I plugged the VCDS in and the fault is no voltage and no communication.the original sensor had a part number of 8R090780A Which seems to be for 2014-2016 modelsSo does that last letter mean there is a difference or have i got a faulty new sensor.Any ideascheers","July 5, 2023"

ScottyUK,I wasn't aware of this. I keep my car's a long time so this will be great,"May 3, 2023"
rifleman,I think the trick is to get the pads done before your discs are worn - they won't fit the free pads to any discs that are below the recommended limit for your car.You still have to pay for the sensor (about a tenner) but the pads and labour for fitting them is free for life (regardless of how many different variants of cars you ever own) - all you must do is remember to transfer the policy to your new car within 30 days of taking ownership.,"May 9, 2023"

Bearing in mind that Madrid is roughly in the centre of Spain then I would assume that they will use rail. However, it will not go directly from Emden to Madrid, as it will stop at other centres. The train will deliver to a distribution centre so your Q5 will not move again until the car transporter is full. Once the Q5 gets to the dealer then a PDI is performed which takes a maximum of a day. If they use a ship then the process is more complicated and it would add up to a week to the transportation.","December 15, 2021"

Not sure what it'll be when we start towing the horse trailer.One other thing that I've found a bit odd is the number of re-gen cycles it has done (probably 4 or 5 in the first 1800 miles). On one particular occasion it did one the day after it had had a 150 mile motorway trip - so not much logic in that.Click to expand...Thanks for the update.

I see coasting on the dash, usually at higher speeds when easing off the accelerator.I believe most ICE Audis are now MHEV engines.

melltt,"I have just traded my 59 plate Q5 for a new 2017 one. My 59 ran 18 inch 235/60 Bridgestone Dueller. The new one has 19 inch 235/55 Michelin Latitude Sport. I am very surprised at the much increased tyre noise on the new model, noticeable after immediately swapping cars. It sounds like the brake pads rubbing and initially I also thought it could be a noisy transmission. However it is neither as I ocassionaly hit a smooth patch of quiet road tarmac it almost vanishes. But 90% of the road tarmac is of the noisier type.My question is what type of tyres do any others have on their new 2017 Q5 and do they notice any noise. Its hard to believe that moving from 18 inch to 19 inch would make such a difference or is it Michelin's are noisy.My 8 Year's ownership provided a very reliable car to 80000 miles with a depreciation of only £2.5K per annum.","February 20, 2023"
Justanhonestman,"Hi melltt-- I also found my tyres were noisy on delivery of my s-line which has the standard 19s. But I found the noise gets lower as the tyres lose the square edges of the tread pattern and become more rounded as the miles increase. I have 1800 mls on the clock and I tend not to notice the issue now. I think the cabin is so quiet that it highlights noises which were classed as 'normal' in other cars. As you say, the noise changes due to changing road surfaces but stick with it, the noise should start to lower as time goes on. Cheers","October 8, 2017"
Gizmob,Mine noisy too (depending on tarmac). Done 2500 miles and same. On 18 inch. Noticibly noisier than my previous qashqai. Carwow on YouTube talks about this as justanhonestman reported. Not sure if S line is more quieter as rear windows are better insulated.,"October 8, 2017"

Rexus,"Picked up my new Q5 this week, with Michelin tyres. Bad road noise from the rear, almost a droning sound above 20mph, even on smooth tarmac. It almost seems like a worn bearing noise, but I think it’s the tyres. Will probably go back to the dealer next week and see what they say.","October 26, 2017"
Justanhonestman,If the sound insulation felt behind the rear panels is fitted as badly as the felt within my two opening fuse holder compartments in the boot when new. It's no wonder noise is intruding into the cabin. I always have my parcel shelf extended which helps muffle any sounds from the rear. Yet another issue letting this car down. I may be looking at fitting my own sound insulation in the boot and sides area. Shouldn't really have to do this though.,"October 26, 2017"
Gizmob,Michelin are 2 dB more than other tyres. Previously had desert duellers with minimal tyre noise on qashqai.,"October 26, 2017"
Rexus,"Thanks for the advice, I'm planning to glue the insulation in place today, and will try driving with the parcel shelf extended as you suggest. Not a bad idea to fit extra insulation either.","October 27, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Rexus I think also it's a trait of SUV's. With all that open space behind the rear seats, it's gonna amplify and echo any noise produced in that area. I'm now on the lookout for decent sound deadening material. My first experiment will be to fold the rear seats down and cover the whole area with a king size duvet to see how much quieter it becomes. I know- you're probably saying he needs to get out more lol but I like a challenge.Cheers.","October 27, 2017"

Ransman,14-18db is absolutely humungous. Not sure we have enough duvets though,"October 29, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"There is a site called 'auto-decibel-db' which lists cabin noise levels for a huge range of cars. They have the 2014 Q5 2.0 petrol coming in at 57db's at 55mph and 60db's at 60mph. As the new model has much more road noise than the last one and is built with lighter materials, It would be interesting to see what readings they get testing the new model. Of course, different road surfaces produce different noise levels, but the noise in the new model can be quite -- tiresome. I also have the pano roof which will not help to keep the sound down.Update-- Car and Driver website report a level of 67db's at 70mph with a solid roof during their review of the new Q5.","October 29, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Rexus I have the same tyres but on 19s on my TFSI. Until I can get hold of a proper sound measuring device I cannot be sure of true readings. All I know is that the noise is louder than any car I have been in. The cabin is quiet and a conversation can be had with rear passengers without raising your voice. But the constant rushing air type of noise from the tyres seems to overpower the cabin. Is the drivetrain adding to the mix ? Who knows, but we will stick with the tyres for now.

Rexus,"My problem is there is an additional noise, on top of the usual road noise, which sounds a bit like someone blowing across the top of a beer bottle. It appears to be coming from the rear at anything over 20 mph. Went back to the dealer who agrees the noise is there. We then drove another Q5 with the same tyres and the noise was there too. We then drove an SQ5 and no noise. It could be the Michelin tyres that are the cause, and also, maybe the noise is worse with new Michelin tyres. The next thing is to find a Q5 with tyres other than Michelin Lattitude Sport 3, and see what that sounds like. It would be useful to hear from a forum member with tyres other than the Michelins.","October 31, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Rexus I have been reading some American sites where they also have been discussing the Q5 tyre/road noise problem. A lot of the owners swear by Goodyear Eagle F1 tyres reporting much lower noise in the car. Apparently most had changed from Continentals to the Eagle F1s.

Rexus,Justanhonestman: Do you know if the American site complaints related to the current Q5 or the previous model. I assume there would be a difference between the two.,"November 1, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Rexus it was the new Q5 which they were reviewing. Don't ask what the sites were lol but it was a mixture of motoring magazines, independant reviewers and forums etc. But most mentioned the high road/tyre noise. While waiting on my new Q5 being delivered, the dealer gave me an S-line Plus deisel with 1500 miles on it. There was certainly no noise similar to what I am getting now in my new model Q5. I actually thought about making them an offer on the mk1 I drove. I really liked it and it felt a more solid and robust car. But it makes sense to go for the latest model and tech I suppose -- or so I thought lol. Cheers","November 1, 2017"
Rexus,"It turns out, that the demonstrator Q5 I drove in June, and which had very little road noise, was fitted with Michelin Lattitude Sport 3 tyres, the same as mine. If my road noise is being caused by tyres, then the only conclusion is that the noise must reduce with mileage. Dealer is still looking for a Q5 with different tyres to compare.","November 9, 2017"

Shibooee,I’m going to attempt to bring this thread back from the dead. I just picked up a 2016 q5 s line with 20” wheels. The tires are brand new Bridgestone duelers. I’m going to attempt the same duvet test using a free iPhone decibel app. I don’t have the cargo cover so the test will just be before and after duvet. If it pans out I’m planning to put some sound absorbing foam in the wheel wells and in the spare tire area to help deaden the tire noise. It’s definitely the first because when I’m on smooth asphalt the car is completely silent. Also the sound is coming only from the rear of the car.,"June 24, 2021"
thecatman,I think the car is pretty quiet overall especially on good tarmac. Road noise is the biggest issue on modern cars. Can’t compare it to previous model Q5 but my older Jaguars were extremely quiet compared to the aluminium built ones.,"July 26, 2021"

Charlie711,"Rexus said:Justanhonestman - wow, you've certainly got some interesting results.Took my Q5 on a 100 mile run today. I'm trying to accept the road noise as normal, but I can't. It's almost like there is an additional noise, over and above regular tyre noise, that is present at anything over 20 mph. It also appears to be coming from the rear passenger side, but that could of course be deceptive. I can honestly say I've never experienced such noise in any car I've driven, and it certainly wasn't there when I test drove the demonstrator last June.I think the first thing to understand is whether there is a significant difference between tyre models and wheel sizes, so perhaps forum member could say what tyre size and make/model their Q5 has and if they consider their car to be road noisy.So, I have a TFSI with 18inch, Michelin Lattitude Sport tyres and the car has a lot of intrusive road noise.The demonstrator had 19inch tyres, tyre brand unknown and the car is no longer at the dealer to find out, and road noise was minimal.I'll be returning to the dealer this week and will ask to drive their current demonstrator, and will report back here.Any further results would be very welcome.Click to expand...Hello ,Rexus,I have just purchased a 2021 Q5 and I am having the same road noise problems.

Blowers,Have always cleaned my cars myself except for the last 12 mths.Ageing process and bad back so resorted to using local hand wash car wash which has been fine. Previous car had 18 inch alloys but had no problem.However with my new Q5 and 21inch diamond cut wheels I can’t see any option but to revert back to car cleaning myself. I am reading lots of horror stories where diamond cut wheels are ruined by the acidic pre- wash that is applied. I have no idea what the local car wash uses but I doubt if it is anything special. I also have a Tesco “Wave” car wash within a few miles and I understand they use autoglym products. However yet again I have read in their reviews that they too have ruined some diamond cut wheels .So it seems back to diy…..unless there are any other sensible solutions I haven’t thought about??????????,"December 12, 2022"

Blowers,"Not sure of US wheel spec as I believe likely to be different to UK. Am also no expert on diamond cut wheels as they are new to me , but have read of a number of instances where acid based cleaners have caused untold damage to diamond cut wheels. The acid can strip the surface and allow water to penetrate and make them ugly apparently. I am still trying to sort a local valeter. If I cannot do that my plan is to buy a bottle of PH neutral wheel cleaner and get my local car wash people to use that instead of whatever unknown substance they use on every car .Hope that helps and I am sure someone with better knowledge than me will chip in here.","December 11, 2022"
GJH0702,I had diamond cut wheels on Mercedes E class and local car wash use ‘acid’ which caused damage to surface of wheels causing paint to bubble - had them refinished at local paint shop.Now only use PH. products - but for health reasons now difficult to wash car myself hence getting just a wash at local Valeter.Agree with your suggestion of getting local car wash to use your product - I used Bilt Hammer and it is ‘kind’ to wheels .,"December 12, 2022"

As you say, press the foot brake firmly when stopped and you will see the green brake light lit on the dash. There’s no need to manually engage the parking brake switch (“handbrake” equivalent) unless you are leaving the car. The parking brake when engaged is shown by a red brake light on the dash. You will also hear the servos on the rear discs engage.The online pdf manuals I found are all North American so have a few key specification differences eg headlights.","December 7, 2022"
Blowers,Thanks again Bulla -got it. Am assuming once it’s set then after each journey it will still remain set? Just been looking at a BMW site which clearly shows polarised views on their autohold system .A lot love it -but an equal amount hate it. It seems many prefer the “creep” in traffic jams so turn it off. I am not sure with Audis but others indicate that if you engage Autohold then stop and turn off engine the parking brake will engage and light up too?…,"December 7, 2022"
Bulla,"Yes, Autohold remains set until you switch it off. On the Q5 the parking brake only seems to engage automatically when you switch off the engine if you park on a slope. Our Audi Q3, however, does engage every time the engine is switched off which I prefer.","December 7, 2022"

Apple car play was set up by my dealer but I don’t recall changing settings. No easy place to pull over so the call was not made.

Blowers,Yes totally understand re the future affordability issue. Due to the current component shortage and I guess most dealers having a 12mth plus wait for new cars the second hand market seems over inflated. I never thought I would pay £50k for a second hand car but then again I didnt think I would retain close to 60 per cent of the purchase price of my 6 yr old Merc so it’s all relative I guess. I was torn between keeping my Merc (which hasn't missed a beat) and driving it into the ground -but with my annual mileage I think I would have been in the ground first. My plan is to keep the Q5 it all being well for 5 years -then will it have to be some Korean 4 x4 I wonder. I feel they are making progress…but…,"November 30, 2022"
Skiman,I think I will be keeping my Q5 Vorsprung for the foreseeable. I normally would part ex it after three years. The good thing with our models they have every option on it and the technology is bang up to date so probably future proofed for many years to come. I will then look at electric motors after that reluctantly.,"November 30, 2022"
Skiman,"Blowers said:Finally, yesterday picked up the 18 mth old Q5 Vorsprung as shown in my avatar . Purchased under approved used scheme from main dealer In Buckinghamshire .Part exchanged my 6 year old low mileage Merc GLC. The dealer process was ok-but was surprised at the number of papers that had to be signed and the compliance requirements on the dealer. A good thing but took over an hour to sort. Car was very well presented but the boot was soaking wet from a very recent clean. Had to laugh as much to my suprise the large balance of payment went straight through on my debit card with no security requirements - then later in the afternoon used it again for about £20 which prompted a security check-bit late by then!Audi was offering 2 years warranty (a further 6 mths beyond the 3 year standard warranty on this car ) and I was surprised the 2 year service plan was being offered with a 25 per cent discount up to year end. £16 and a few pence mthly seemed pretty good so I took that up.Have only driven 15 miles or so back home from dealer, a local family visit to pub and my golf course and back today.I have been a bit concerned about “buyers remorse” -have I made the right decision etc?.This mainly centred around the seats-having made a bad decision in the past on a BMW which I thought I would get used to ,but didn’t, and had to sell quickly. I only had a short test drive in the Audi and couldn’t get the lumbar support to make much difference. Pleased to say that since driving( and checking a new vehicle in the showroom before parting with money) I am confident that the lumbar support is ok- haven't quite yet nailed my optimum driving position but am sure that I will. Particularly appreciated the massage seats -first two setting are fine but not so keen on the third. Have tried different suspension settings but to be honest not feeling a huge difference between comfort /auto etc.A very minor issue can’t believe Audi penny pinching by not automatically adding the extended storage pack on the Vorsprung which has most everything else. It’s around £225 includes boot nets , the little,storage compartment to the side of driver, but most importantly those nets that fit on the back of the front seats are not there .. Not sure about the different interior lighting options- can see the coloured lines but not much else.My biggest gripe is me. Slightly nervous driving what seems significantly different to the GLC which I knew inside out, with everything familiar and immediately to hand. I find the amount of Audi technology quite staggering and its difficult to absorb all the different possible functions and permutations especially the new (to me)driving assistance aids.. Started on the 350,page handbook last night…fell asleep by page 5. It’s ok to read about them but different to decide what to use and how they work in the real world.So far I have managed once not to not be able to find either reverse or drive. Got stuck. Got it sorted but don’t know how I did it.Phone got connected at dealers but when in the car this morning the phone would not connect. Don’t know why. Later today I turned Bluetooth off and on and it finally reconnected but don’t want to fafff about each time.On the MMi scream every time I turn car on it says I have remote access rights-then\it says “”select user“ or “continue” is there any way I can get rid of this screen message please?Also I get a message that says “notes”- “Interior monitor” not sure what that is about and how to get rid of it.I noticed driving home on a main road in the dark tonight that the all-singing lights worked a treat automatically without a need for me to dip headlights etc. -however when I turned off to a country lane with little traffic I had to put main beam on manually and dip lights when cars approached despite lights still on auto setting. Perhaps someone could kindly educate me.I think I should concentrate on just driving for a while as even trying to work out steering wheel functions/hud/the cockpit display and the MMI is a bit much to take in-and I haven’t even started with Apple Car play /map options etc.So after 24 hours I am really really liking my purchase. I am sure in due course I shall love it.Of course any general tips /suggestions on any of the above ..or indeed recommended settings etc or anything else that might help an old fella who has driven for over 50 years would be very much welcomed.(Now can Iget the car to talk to my Alexa device to talk to my Nest to turn the heating up ha ha)Many thanks all.Click to expand...For the auto lights you just need to push the head light stalk forward. The beam indicator light in the drivers display binnacle will turn blue and will stay blue when a vehicle comes towards you though the lights will actually dip automatically. When you are in a built up area the headlight beam indicator will change from blue to white to show that it is deactivated and returns to blue automatically when out of a built up are.","November 29, 2022"
Blowers,Thankyou. If I recall correctly I had the blue beam indicator light showing to the right of a green indicator light when on the main road. When turned onto a dark country lane the blue light disappeared leaving the green one from which I then had to turn on/off main beam . Perhaps I flicked the stalk by mistake somehow. Another manual search methinks!,"November 29, 2022"
Skiman,In my Vorsprung If the green indicator light is showing you are not in the adaptive light mode it’s just in the regular dipped beam mode. You need to push the light stalk forward and the light turns blue. my Vorsprung is a pre face lift version of yours so it could be different to yours. Until you get used to it it’s weird as you feels you are on full beam and going to blind on coming traffic.,"November 29, 2022"

I had the Fuel Filter(pump) replaced along with the seal and lock ring as it was determined that the leak was coming from that age old issue. Well, looks like it is not the cure. I fill the tank and it runs out for about fifty miles before it stops. I don't have personal access to a lift and I am disabled so I am limited right out of the gate. I took it to the abandoned school in my village to investigate further. There is an area where the students entered the building bordered by curbs on either side of the entry area. I drove the passenger wheels up onto the walk and gas poured out quite quickly. It looks like it is leaking towards the Drivers rear of the tank area. I turned the car around and drove the drivers wheels up and it appeared to stop leaking. I found a mechanic who does work on Audi's and has a lift at his home garage. He is a good guy and I believe he will help me out but I am looking for some insight from this group. I was unable to get far enough under the car to see if the leak it coming off the top of the tank or elsewhere. Wish I could have determined that.

Replaced vacuum solenoid, smoked tested all vacuum lines, checked air flow readings etc. no fault codes show except p0299. drove 250 mile round trip today to fast turbo workshop and they plugged it in, drove it etc and say the turbo is good, has the right pressure etc and everything is communicating and doing what it should. To me it feels like the wastegate isn’t set up properly.

All 1st generation styles are 8.5J with ETA 33 offset. I’ve done a calculation onwilltheyfit.com, and it says they’d sit 0.3mm closer to the suspension uprights on the inside and poke out 12.3mm further on the outside.I’m fine with that but my concern is the clearance between the wheel spokes and front brake calipers.

mwcltd,No problem with the installation of Audi ring puddle lights. I purchased mine directly from Audi as I have heard bad stories about third party ones. I have done it and it took 10 mins for both sides.,"August 29, 2022"

mwcltd,"No, mines a 2022. Previously I had a Q3 with basic puddle lights, I bought a couple of Audi ring replacements off ebay and they did not fit.","August 29, 2022"
J19snp,Was your Q3 2018 which is why you know it will fit? I am going to see if i can order direct as I would prefer to do that for peace of mind,"August 29, 2022"
mwcltd,My first Q3 was 2017 and the second was 2020. The issue was on the 2017 one. I successfully moved the ring puddle lights between both Q3's and then to my current Q5. My mistake was ordering them for the 2017 Q3.,"August 29, 2022"
Skiman,I saw some advertised on eBay by an Audi dealer. I just rang them quoted the reg no and were advised that they would fit (there are a couple of different types) easy to fit I borrowed a friends plastic tool with a curved head to remove the original ones).,"August 29, 2022"
SQ5_NW,The good thing about the Audi ring's ones (genuine) is that they are brighter than many of the third party eBay ones.I bought genuine ones (2nd hand) off eBay and then bought some SQ5 ones off a US seller.

SuperD007,"Thanks for the response@missile, I think that's more like what I mean... not really twitchy like if it's dancing around everywhere but the steering is super duber light so it feels twitchy instead of planted. Is this normal? I'm baffled as to how the guys in some of the Youtube videos are hitting speeds of 260/270km/h with the steering being so light. I've done speeds of 250km/h on much older modified cars that felt a lot more planted than my SQ5. It's a bit concerning and disappointing... I was actually hoping it might be something as simple as wheel weights/balancing that could be the issue...I have 20inch tyres on and was wondering if maybe even wider tyres might help...might be best for me to get a suspension test done anyway just to make sure there is nothing going on there.","August 16, 2022"

SQ-Raphster,SuperD007 what make and model of tyres are you running?,"August 18, 2022"
SuperD007,Hey@SQ-Raphsterthanks for the response. When I purchased the car the dealership had put on of brand new tyres for me. They ended up fitting Blackhawk Street HUO2 tyres. I know it's not as ideal as a set of Conti's or Pirelli's but when I check some of the reviews for these tyres online they seemed okay. Do you think this could be causing the light steering at high speed?,"August 19, 2022"
SuperD007,"SQ-Raphster said:@SuperD007no idea if those tyres are any good as they only seem to sell them in SA, it was just my initial hunch.

I guess I'm going to have to do a deeper dive to see what could be the root cause. Will update the thread once I've done a bit more investigation, hopefully, it's something simple like wheel balancing weights even.","August 23, 2022"
mwcltd,"Blackhawk tyres are manufactured in China since 2002. They do not have the pedigree of established players but I have heard no bad reports about them. Road holding at very high speed is dependant on a number of factors including the tyres. For a tall, heavy vehicle with little steering feedback I would not go in to 3 figures for any period of time. However, if you must, then tyre pressures need to be reduced and the chassis alignment checked or alternatively purchase an R8.","August 24, 2022"
SuperD007,Thanks for the response@mwcltdappreciate your insight on the matter. Reducing pressure and checking chassis alignment seems like sensible first few steps to take to see if it rectifies it. Honestly at speeds of up to 180km/h she is well planted and feels exactly like what a sports SUV should feel like ...just seems to lose a lot of that planted feel when u start hitting the 200km/h range... I have a friend with a 2.0TDI Q5 and he says his car is perfectly fine around the 200km/h mark. So it must be some up with my setup..... R8?....maybe one day when I grow up,"August 25, 2022"

rifleman,"missile said:Spotted this on a.n.other forum>In case anyone doesn’t already know, if your car is 2013 or newer, it will have the service history as a digital service record and you can actually access this all via the myAudi app.In order to access the Audi digital service history you first have to be “defined as the owner” of the vehicle.There are two ways to do this:1. Go into your local dealership with a copy of the v5c and proof of ID and ask the service advisor to define you as the owner so you can access your digital service history via the myAudi app.2. Call Audi UK customer services, choose the digital service option and they can do it over the phone for you. You will however need the v5c for the car and your passport to hand and also a camera phone as they switch to video to verify the documents on the call.Then once you are defined as the owner, you can go into the myAudi app, scroll down to “Service topics”, click on “Your service area”, then click on “Service History” and all your digital service history will be there.It can take a few hours or a day or two to update so don’t worry if it doesn’t come up immediately.Hope that helps!Click to expand...Didn't actually know we could access it personally.

And I think the point above just proves why - tyre wear could vary dramatically depending on your style of driving. I would be able to say how many miles I'd covered in a set, I guess, but only if I was really paying attention when I put them on. It really needs a standardised system to accurately record these things.I'd much rather trust the independent tyre tests and ratings for grip and noise.","May 22, 2019"

They have apologised for the inconvenience and offered me £250 to go away quietly,it seems to me that either committed to this ridiculous cost down but have rolled back on it now, or they didn’t have enough parts for the adjustable version so did a mod, and now they have stock again, either way it has left me even more annoyed.fuming.","August 19, 2021"

SQ-Raphster,"Seems as so iOS 11 from Apple has messed up the connection. What iOS version is your iPhone running?Try this procedure which is from here (Click me):It seems that it's the phone handshaking with AMI that is failing, but if AMI starts up expecting to find a phone, and one is already there, it works ok. To achieve this, I have to plug the phone into the cable before I put the key in and switch on the primary electrics, i.e. before AMI wakes up. What's more I need to wait a few seconds so that the phone recognises the cable and activates the port. If I switch on too soon the problem still occurs. So typically I plug the phone in first, then put my seatbelt on, by which time I'm probably ok to start car. Conversely when getting out of the car I switch the car off, wait a few seconds, then unplug the phone. So the phone isn't unplugged until AMI has switched itself off completely. Again, taking off my seatbelt and opening the door before unplugging is usually a long enough wait so it's not a big deal.Click to expand...Or try this procedure from here (Click me):I solved this issue with the following steps:1. Disconnect usb/lightning cable from your phone2. Powercycle your phone by powering off and powering on.3. Open Apple Music and play any downloaded song. You must have at least one song in your Music App. If not, sync one song from iTunes or download from iTunes Store.4. Connect USB/lightning cable while music still playing on phone.5. Watch and listen as the audio magically transfers from your phone to your car audio.Tip: If you’re Spotify user, remember to follow the same procedures by starting up the Music app first.

Isleaiw,"Old_Geezer said:A straight forward question on whether to carry out tyre/wheel rotation directly from front to rear after a given mileage.As most drivers will know, if carried out quite frequently tyre/wheel rotation will even out tyre wear and make the set last longer, thus allowing all 4 tyres to be changed at the same time.I came from many years of BMW with staggered set up and rear wheel drive only, and also cars with permanent 4 wheel drive (BMW x Drive), so it did not make sense to rotate and was not advocated in the user manuals.I am now running a 2017 Q5 2.0 TFSI S Line with the latest Quattro Ultra transmission that disengages the rear wheel drive transmission when cruising along, and it could be that there may well be more tread remaining on the rear tyres if they are not rotated directly from front to rear after many milesI have looked in the latest manual and it gives no help on this subject because theQuattro Ultra 4 wheel drive systemis new to the Q5.This is a question to the latest MK2 Q5 drivers! Have you changed tyres over (directly from front to back) or are you considering changing over in the near future? If so at what mileage.Note 1. I do realise that the front tyres do wear slightly different due to steering geometry and I can see there is a difference at 5000 miles. This could be the time for the first rotation.Note 2. If you do respond even saying you are not going to rotate, please add your currently mileage.Click to expand...I was debating it but hadnt reached a decision when at 8k miles I noticed a tear in tyre sidewall (probably from a pothole...)That meant two new tyres so rotated at that point as it was rear that was damaged, so two new on front and old fronts on rear.Now on 13k miles and havent checked them recently as been away but last time i looked they all looked good for a while yet.

Old_Geezer,"Agree with the wear on the Golf. I have had 6, yes six from new over the years and they always wore away the fronts earlier because of the heavier front end. In fact so did the Audi A3 2.0 litre Tdi in 2003. I would hope the G5 might give more even wear because I can see Audi have made an effort to get somewhere like a 50/50 weight distribution with the battery in the boot.","August 25, 2018"
PRT,"I like to swap my tyres round to ensure even wear, I notice when my first service was due ( after a year, 8000 miles) that the front had worn a bit more than the rear, as I would expect as the car is predominantly front wheel drive. I ask my very helpful dealership Five Oaks Audi to swap the around which they did free of charge when the car was serviced. Another reason I do this is if not swapped the fronts will wear out first and when replacing a pair of tyres it is recommended the new tyres go on the rear of the vehicle, something the tyre fitters do not do as a matter of course, or grudgingly if requested.","August 25, 2018"

shabazmo,"""it is recommended the new tyres go on the rear of the vehicle"", this statement is outdated and relates to when there was no ABS, ASR and traction control.

mwcltd,Over four decades Audi have had a number of four wheel drive systems. The haldex is only active when slip is detected so almost all the time the car is front wheel drive only. In reality tyre wear is almost totally dependant on how you drive the car. With haldex I would wait until the rear tyre tread depth is about 4mm then rotate the wheels/tyres. Doing nothing affects the handling of the car as you will end up with minimal tread on the front and significantly more on the rear. I would strongly recommend that tyres on the same axle are replaced at the same time and if possible with the same tread pattern as the other axle.,"June 4, 2022"

Are there other ""packages"" or ""accessories"" you think are a mustor that you'd give a ""strong recommendation"" for in regards to this vehicle when purchasing new?Also, they never mentioned at the dealership that this car is also available in an e version. This is a hybrid version, right? What exactly does that mean for the Q5?How much better mileage will we get if we go with the E version? The E model is also considerably faster, correct? How much more expensive is the E version? Is there any reason to NOT get the E version?","March 25, 2022"

SpikeR626,"Jeremy_SWE said:Hi,I'm not sure how the ""Packages"" differ to the UK (or Sweden where I am), so difficult to say what is included or not etc. But I'll add som info regarding my model and experience regarding trim/accessories etc.I have an S-Line (Ibis white) with the Black optic package and I much prefer it to having those trim parts in silver, especially the rear diffuser and fake exhausts as they blend in a lot better, all personal opinion of course. I also think the S-Line looks a lot nicer with the honeycomb grill and the whole front just looks a bit cooler.I have the 10 speaker ""Audi sound system"" which is ok, but coming from a car with DynAudio, it was a bit of a step down. So if you can get the B&O system then I'd go for that. Otherwise I think that accessories etc are a very personal taste and choice.Your assumption about there being a hybrid version is correct, the 55 TFSIe. Don't expect more than about 23 miles on the battery, so if you're mainly doing short journeys then it's a good choice. Otherwise the 262 bhp petrol engine will be quite thirsty. And yes, it's a bit faster when you have both electric and petrol powertrains combined (so enjoy those first 23 miles).All info regarding models, prices, and consumption can be found here:Build your own > 2022 Q5 > 2022 > Q5 [REDIRECT] > Audi | Luxury sedans, SUVs, convertibles, electric vehicles & moreClick to expand...Thank you for your reply! Do you know how much extra it is to add the B&O system?Also, you mention that you get 23 miles on the battery. So how does that work exactly? The first 23 miles you'd drive around town would use no gas and then gas would be used after that?Also, there is a significant performance increase in the hybrid model, correct? Is the increase in performance only available for the first 23 miles? After that, the vehicle is nofaster than the standard vehicle?","March 25, 2022"

a.donatello3637,Hi All!I am currently looking for a used Q5 and have done quite a bit of research. I see that it was redesigned in 2018. When looking at Consumer Reports the 2018 got average predicted reliability whereas the 2019 received an above average rating in this category. This is steering me towards a 2019 even though the 2018s are much more in my price range and there seems to be more out there. Can anyone give feedback on these years and why one may have rated higher than the other??,"January 18, 2022"
missile,Welcome to our forum,"January 17, 2022"
SQ-Raphster,Welcome to the forumAre you one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?I would say the new model is reported as higher reliability because basically its newer. Newer cars are less likely to have issues. Give it another year or two and the 2019 model might average out a bit on reliability. Also the engine and tech in the 2019 model is newer and should have resolved past issues that may have affected past reliability etc.,"January 18, 2022"

I've been looking at a Q5 for about 6 months now (I've currently got an A5 Black Edition) and finally took the plunge and put a deposit on one last week. It was in the dealers group stock and it was delivered to the dealer yesterday. I went to have a look today and it has quite a few swirl marks on the paintwork. I had asked that it wasn't washed before I took delivery of it but it was washed at the dealership it was originally at as it was on display as part of an event they had. They have said they will get the local detailer they sometimes use to remedy this but I'm concerned this will cover them for a short while but they will then return. It's taken the shine (excuse the pun!!) off getting the Q5. I'm not sure what to do as I'm spending a lot of money on a car that doesn't now feel pristine.","October 6, 2021"

If there are lot of swirl marks then the car needs to have a complete detail to complete remove them all. This is achieved by machine polishing.When a car body is sprayed, it first has a primer sprayed on it(varies between 8 to 38 microns thickness), followed by the base colour coat (varies between 13 and 38 microns), then it finally has had a lacquer layer sprayed over this top paint layer.

They want £100 for 60GB of data, but I have a SIM that gives me 30GB for £10 per month.

missile,"There is no simple answer. Machine polishing removes paint, deeper the scratch(es) the more paint will need to be removed. It is not rocket science and some owners DIY. However, a careless detailer can very quickly remove paint down to the primer on panel edges. You might want to buy, beg, borrow or steal a paint thickness meter.","February 17, 2014"

Sj1000,"José said:The problem is these protection offerings are all about what you do before you apply it...You don't want to seal in swirl marks and any other imperfections. Getting the paintwork prepped at minimum is a 3-4 hour job, some guys spend 2 days doing it!Dealerships employ a couple of 17 year olds to wash the cars when they are in for service - guess who also does the paint protection...Applying the protection is also a skill in itself to get and even coating all round etc. Again, something I would say takes years of experience to get right.Detailing is a skill and an art form, get someone who feels this way about the profession to do your car, not a young petrol head.The dealership job will probably look 'OK' on the day, but not 'GREAT' but more importantly it will last only a few weeks due to poor application. Also consider the cost, most dealerships charge between 2 and 4 times what a professional detailer does!!!

Absolutely, as far as I am concerned.If there are any issues with the finish they will be rectifying it, but my experience with Bristol Audi has been very good to date so I am not anticipating a problem.Click to expand...I think part of this is how particular you are about your paintwork... 99% of people are happy with a clean car.But then there are people like myself that want it better than showroom condition.I'm sure you'll be more than happy with what Bristol do - as you say, a detailer could have done better, but how far you want to go is a matter of personal taste.","February 18, 2014"

aj84,"Hi all,Having just purchased a 2018 SQ5, I'm wondering if anyone has purchased rubber mats for this model Q5/SQ5?I just put mine in and noticed the drivers side is quite short when you think any splashing from the feet end up on the main carpet. When comparing to fabric mats, they fit nicely under the pedals.Just curious if this is the same for anyone else hereThanks in advance!","December 15, 2020"

aj84,Thanks both -I guess Missile is probably more closer to what I am doing as its a petrol > diesel (mines the other way round) but TGR - that V6 smooth comment is exactly what I do not want to let go.The Q5 I had been looking at has potentially one so still no test drive however I am potentially putting an SQ5 3.0 tfsi on the list.

Mitch,I have been enjoying my 2014 Q5 for a little over a year now and have started to think about a few little DIY improvements and tidying up the car a bit. The interior is generally good but an area of significant wear is the drivers side B Pillar trim panel where the seat belt adjustment is. I have found out how to unclipthe trim panel however I am stumped as to how the seat belt can be removed so the panel can be replaced and cannot find any information online.I appreciate that this is a safety feature and may require specialist knowledge and might require a trip to a mechanic but having managed to find a good condition trim panel I am keen to replace my tatty one.Advice and guidance greatly appreciated.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk,"October 31, 2020"

It’s worse if the birds in the area have young ones in a nest or have just left the nest. If it’s a single splodge just leave a wet sponge on it for 10-15 mins and hose off.

I did use it a bit however; decent quality sound and pics, plays dvd and cd's, both screens (and entire fixing unit) are detachable with chargeable batteries which can be charged from the mains as well as by the car - essentially portable dvd players with stands. Still got them in fact.Quite versatile, compared to for example the xc90 version built directly into the front headrest. I was always hanging fleeces over them to cover them up.","August 13, 2013"

There is no difference with any of them except that they use different additives per tanker load for who ever is having the fuel delivered.I met a tanker driver last year who was filling up the Gulf station down the road from us.

Well maintained, long lasting, so I depreciation didn't matter to me. If I want to get rid of this 3.0L diesel Q5. the cost of getting into something else is prohibitive. Also, I'm not inspired by anything else, short of the new Cayenne Hybrid (CAD$130K configured as I want), which is nearly 3x the price of my Q5 when new. And try getting a lower cost per mile, or lower fuel consumption (emissions) in a similar vehicle. Where I live, diesel costs less than regular gas, and premium gas is about 15% more expensive, without offering 15% better fuel economy than my diesel.So my car is a lot worse than it used to be, but there's no practical alternative for me. Money no object, I'd get the Cayenne Hybrid, and I'd have about 1/2 of diesel's best highway cost-per-mile while driving in town (using the alleged 40km EV range). I'd also have a more luxurious vehicle, and not be limited by EV range or charge stations. I like the Cayenne, overall, though not as comprehensively as my Q5 when new.

The gap at the top of the slot is 11 mm.These are exact as I can measure and would suggest making your bracket 20mm at the base - 4mm for the slot hight and 10mm for the gap at the top. I take it the bars are the same for the SQ and the standard Q ? Hope this helps get your brackets made. Cheers,"July 3, 2019"

Personally, I just leave my light switch in the Auto position and left the light sensor do its stuff.The lights will only come on automatically when they sense the external light level is low, which may not be the case if the wipers are working during very light rain, however, from my experience, my lights normally do Illuminate when it's raining.Hope this helps?Click to expand...It does help thank you.

My last car had adaptive cruise control and did the stop-go thing when in queues, as does the Q5, but the Q5 has traffic jam assist that is also supposed to steer up to 40 MPH. Does anyone know how to activate it rather than the standard stop-go without the steering?2. There is no spare wheel with the car ( i subsequently realised that I should have bought a collapsible spare), but where the spare wheel would normally sit, there is a round plastic insert the same size as a wheel but with some sort of electrical connector attached. What is it?Thanks for any feedback.","August 21, 2018"

Use same procedure as above to reactivate the system","August 7, 2018"
Nemo,Congrats on the new car ????????I find traffic jam assist one of the best features of the car - assuming you travel on a route with traffic that is.You need to have Lane Assist active which is via a button on the indicator stalk from memory. Then when in traffic just turn on the ACC and the car will set the speed to something like 20mph and literally move along and keep in lane - if you take your hands off the wheel for more than a certain period of time the car shouts at you and tells you to put hands back on the wheel.,"August 8, 2018"
NEAudi,"Nemo said:This could all be down to Audi retooling as such to make sure they are compliant with the new WLTP regulations.I spoke to Audi CS last week and they said that the order books as such are closed due to this and should reopen in the next couple of weeks.Now I know you've already ordered and potentially should see your car on the tracker at the 'Welcome' stage? Do you know how to look at the background tracker? My guess is if you haven't had BW assigned or confirmed that you're car will become a MY19 car.MY19 cars were meant to start build last week or the week before but have now been moved to Wk49, what I'm not sure about is what's happening at the moment in the factory - has production also literally come to a halt?Click to expand...jSent from my iPad using Tapatalk","August 10, 2018"

James_G,"I can't speak for a 3.0TDi as I only have experience of the 2.0TDI but my wife averages the same in her Q5 as I get from my Mercedes C350 (so similar to your 330D) which is 39mpg. Given BMW diesels tend to be very good re MPG you are going to see a reduction when moving to a Q5 3.0Tdi of that there is no doubt. It's a bigger heavier car with more parasitic loses through the drive train than your BMW, so this is perhaps not surprising.Out of interest why are you swapping? Do you need more space","August 15, 2018"
Old_Geezer,"Worth noting. BMW 3.0 litre diesels do give excellent fuel consumption figures when in just rear wheel drive only cars, but drop back a little when in a 4 x 4 such as the heavier X3 3.0d. Mine used to give around 35 to 36 mpg overall.","August 16, 2018"

Yep - if the window is open when you are out of the car and you are locking it, just keep pressing the lock button on the keyfob till the window is fully closed. Even if you don’t see the window open till after you have locked the car and walked away, it will still close with a long press on the keyfob. I would rather the windows close when the car was locked, but I suppose there is some reason for being set up like it is.","August 16, 2018"

Did you get an update saying the ship had left Veracruz ? Once my car had left Veracruz, the next update told me it was on a ship to the UK. Some cars can be in Emden for a matter of days before shipping to the UK. Others can be waiting for weeks waiting on a ship. It surely cannot be long now before you get the update telling you it’s on a ship for the UK. Others didn’t get any updates and got a call from the dealers telling them the car had arrived.

I know some are not bothered for this, but to it makes it a hugely adaptive car - serenely smooth cruiser in Comfort mode and great fun in Dynamic mode. It doesn't have the driving dynamics of the Macan but this to me was a one trick pony - it excelled at it, Granted, but it needs to be driven fast.

Chopper,"Kramer said:I've been driving the A8 quattro (on summers) all weekend and got home last night at 1am with no problems at all. I had to go down side roads which had deep snow and ice and the car handled it without even seeing the ESP light. Personally I think that winter tyres are great HOWEVER they are a huge pain to fit every year and store plus a significant cost. Winters are useless with less than 4mm tread so you may not get a huge about of life out of them. All together this is a pain which is not really worthwhile for the 1 week of snow we usually get in most of the UK IMO unless you do a load of driving and really need your car working (i.e for work or if you have a baby on the way or something).If you are an experienced driver with quattro you can drive safely on summers. Some of the 2 wheel drive German cars need winter tyres just to move in the snow (like my A5 did) so this would be a must. Last night the side roads were peppered with BMW and Mercs who obviously had given up and ditched the car.If the weather continues like this I think we will see more ""all season"" tyres being offered. I would consider all season next time on my car but there is no way I am shelling out for separate winters. I am very impressed with the Audi Quattro and I felt safe most of the time (breaking is a little more delicate). As long as you are sensible and keep well below the speed limit with lots of room ahead of you the car will be fine.Click to expand...Totally agree with you Kramer. The reason I switched to the Q5 was due to getting stuck in the snow 2-3 years ago and 2 years ago having an accident costing me my NCB and nearly a £1k hike in insurance premiums (also live in a high theft risk area). I'm lucky in that I have a mate with a garage who can store and fit my tyres. As you say its probably the Quattro that does most the work but for me I'd rather be safe than sorry...Hows the A8 treating you?","January 21, 2013"
Ransman,"I managed to get the ESP light to come on a few times down an untreated road this weekend. I am of the opinion that you need to ""explore"" what your car can do in a controlled environment so you get to know it better to help you handle those tricky moments.It's the first time I have driven a 4wd in the snow and ice and I was impressed with the difference.","January 21, 2013"

Ransman,"I understand Land Rover offer ""free"" off- road courses if you are interested in one of their vehicles. If Audi offered the same I would take them up on it (as long as it wasn't my car).","January 21, 2013"
Rog,"I've done the LR stage 1 and 2 course. I got the first one free and i paid for the second. Anyone can pay and do there courses. The techniques they will teach you can be applied to any vehicle as most of the latest LR/RR's don't have the extra diff locks fitted as they are a cost option that most people won't pay for lol.So i think it is worth going and doing a 2 day course.

BorisB,"I have Goodyear Wranglers fitted to an old 4x4 which are marked, ""all weather"" and perform well in the snow. Probably not a great road tyre for the Q5 but I am surprised there are not more all weather tyres available - perhaps compromise is too significant?","January 21, 2013"

marky9074,"jamiekip said:Winter tyres give you options in this scenario. Lets face it, non of us jump to an emergency stop without immediately looking in your rear view mirror to see what's next in line. With winters you could slow and take evasive action to get out of the way. Summers you're a passanger with no option but to ride out the slide and pray. I've had to do this in bad conditions and I drove away with no damange to my car, whlist the car behind has had an accident.As for getting the life out of winter tyres. I run them on my TTRS from November to March/April and I'm on my 3rd season with a set of Michelin Pilot Alpin PA3's. They have 7mm of life on them still all round and when the snow isn't here I drive the car like I normally would, and when temps exceed there operating window, the car is great fun, allowing power slides out of corners at sensible speeds. I'd expected them to die quickly, but they'ree lasting incredibly well.I'm an ambassador for winter tyres now, will recommend them to anyone in a heart beat, and although the cost is initially hard to stomach, they pay for themselves over time as your summer tyres have a longer life tenure, my summers will need changing for the first time in April.I'm still debating whether to get a Q5, but my worry with these cars on snow/ice is tha yes quattro will get you going, but trying to haul speed off 2 tonnes quickly will not be easy on summer tyres.It's a preference thing though, but I guess my point is, there isn't an excuse not to use them, as costs even out over time and most garages will store your winters/summers for you.Click to expand...Hi Jamie,Good to see you on here.

My calculations show I save about 36.3% 39.7% in fuel cost per mile, which translates into a savings of about CAD$765 to $886 per year. That's due to a combination of much better fuel economy, and lower pump prices for fuel.","February 13, 2018"

The fact that it had ""never been damaged"" was appealing and I was ready to buy it.I then noticed that the picture on the listing was the same picture as I'd seen in another advert so I called again to check. The guy told me that the picture I had seen was not the actual car but it looked the same...He gave me the Reg plate of the actual car and said pics would follow.I checked the Reg and it came up as an early 2012 model. At the time I was only looking for a facelift car, I was looking at other (late) 2012 cars that were newer than this one and they were pre-facelift so I was confused as to how this (early) 2012 was a facelift.The dealer said he was 'pretty sure' that it was a facelift but had not actually seen the car yet. The next day he sent me an iPhone photo of the car looking dirty and parked up on a side street with the matching reg - and it was indeed a facelift.I then noticed that the steering wheel had the auto paddleshift, but the car was a manual? Alarm bells again?I made an appointment to view the car to check it out myself. On the morning of the viewing I was told they were having problems starting the car and I wouldn't be able to see it that day. The following day I was told the car was on its way to an Audi specialist to get the issue sorted.A week later I called again and was told the car problem still hadn't been resolved but should be ready in a few days.By this time I had seen another car I was interested in so didn't want to wait around for this one if it was a lemon.I did a HPI check on the car that same day and it noted that the car was written off CAT D in 2015, so it hadn't come ""straight from the insurance"" as I had been told days earlier?I checked out some of the mot history and one of them mentioned it failed an mot for wheel bolts missing in some of the wheels and had something up with the steering rack.Either way I had now lost all interest in the car and forgotten about it, but a few days ago I noticed it appear on autotrader again but this time for £14,880 and looking mint, not the £13,880 it was advertised for a few weeks back.Here is the advert, what do you guys think?https://www.autotrader.co.uk/classified/advert/201803094425888Notice the paddles on the steering wheel but it's a manual? Something about the chrome trim on the front bumper doesn't look the same as other similar cars?I'm guessing it was a pre-facelift, either crashed or stolen and stripped in 2015 and repaired with facelift parts, including a facelift steering wheel from an auto car.

When I shopped for 3rd party winter wheels of similar quality, and whose style I liked, I found the price difference to be in the single digit percentage.

I went the Audi route when I bought by car, and included the Winter Tire Package (in February). I also financed the car and winter tires through Audi at a great deal rather than having to pay for the winters out of pocket, lump-sum.If you do go 3rd party, you will not void your car warranty, providing your wheels and tires do not interfere with the car's brake and suspension components, and the car's bodywork.Many Thanks Stevemak,When I bought my first Q5 I negotiated an extra set of Audi alloys for my winter tyres included in the deal for free!However, with this order they weren't so biddable and were asking 3K! ....

avicov,I get GAP insurance to a point however one thing I can't get my head around.Say you have anew Q5 on a 4 year PCP deal and then after 3 months ownership it's stolen.Your insurance company pays you the market value and then with GAP company they pay you the difference between the market value and what you paid? I think that's correct.Once you get that money are you then meant to pay off Audi the remaining finance amount and then you have to go and sort out a new car deal? Or does Audi get you a new car and null your current finance deal as it's been stolen?As I understand you can't clear or pay off the car till halfway through the contract period?Hope that makes sense what I'm saying!,"January 25, 2018"

If I was going to drive through snow covered side roads and/ or farm tracks etc, would I put the drive select to *off road* or leave it say in comfort mode. I know the drive is set up for FWD as standard and engages all wheels when slip or loss of traction is detected. So what happens when the car is in off road mode ? Are all wheels permanently driving till off road mode is cancelled ? Or does going to off road mode only alter the suspension set up and the quattro system just keeps switching from 2 to 4 wheel drive as required no matter what drive option you have selected. ?","December 18, 2017"

I would think given your departure date that your car would have been on the Viking Qeen and is now in Emden. How long it spends in Emden seems to be a bit of a lottery judging by some other delivery times to dealers from Emden quoted in this forum.

Another example of cost cutting it seems. I am going to look for mats which have a more solid rubberised heel area or put something below the mat like a section of thin plastic sheet to spread the weight over a bigger area. Also in the boot, the removable floor cover is showing signs of fraying. And the most I have had in there were a couple of shopping bags twice a week tight against the rear seat held in place with a stretchy luggage cable hooked to either side.I like my car and the way it drives etc, but once the new BMW X3 is in the showrooms, I will be paying them a visit to compare the interior fiinish and materials used (especially the door facings)Click to expand...When I negotiated the deal on my Q5, once I was happy with the figures I said to the sales guy if you throw in a set of premium car mats I will shake on the deal now which he duly did.

Dermu,My cars build date was 16th of this month but was built early. Took literally 4 days to quality control and 3 days from quality control to show in transit. So from what I see they are building ahead of projected build dates but there may be a logistic issue which is causing delays,"July 20, 2017"
Markee68,My car was ordered in Feb and showed as in transit from Mexico on 20th April then didn't show as arrived in Emden until end of June.It then moved quite quickly to being shipped to the U.K. within a few days.I've been offered the car for collection or delivery from the 27th July and am collecting from the dealer on 31st July.,"July 21, 2017"
Gizmob,Hopefully it should be here soon Nemo,"August 1, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Nemo - they really want to get rid of this tracker system till they have something in place that actually works and can give the customer the information they require. But of course they don't want to highlight any delays in production or logistical problems and delays at the ports etc. It's so frustrating for the customer, but hang in there.","August 2, 2017"
SQ5Tony,We had even less information when waiting for our F Pace. The dealers seemingly have no idea where the car is until it turns up on a trailer. It arrived almost a month early with zero warning!,"August 2, 2017"
Nemo,Great news! Is your build week this week (31?)Mine was last week and looking at background tracker went in to QC on Monday 24th and left factory on 2/8 so in theory over a week in QC - never know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.,"August 2, 2017"

TGR,"Hi, mine was delivered fairly quickly from arriving in Emden then getting to the dealers. It supposedly had lots of checks and inspections in Mexico, Emden and a PDI at the dealers but I'm now a bit sceptical. After having the car for a week and putting 200 miles on the clock I checked the tyre pressures, they should be 33psi, they were 36, 38, 39 and 46. If something as basic as this was missed then perhaps we are all being fed a load of B. S. about the reason for delayed deliveries.","August 22, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Yep-- the dealers are more or less in the same position as the customer regarding tracking info. Once you get your update that the car has left Mexico, you at least know it's heading your way and you can track it to Emden. Hope it doesn't take to long for you. Cheers","August 24, 2017"

Comment from the dealer is:I have called Audi UK this morning because the last time I heard anything about the shipping times they were stating 12 weeks from the build to get through all the different quality checks , which I think I mentioned in a previous email, however this morning they are saying it can be up to 24 weeks.I would like to think the car would come through sooner than this however I can only feedback the information I have been given and keep tracking the progress and as we go through the process we will be able to be more accurate.Im sorry this will not be information you would have like to have heard and my apologies that there may be a delayed delivery date, however it is still early days and we may very well find the car will be through for November as originally planned.Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...My dealers have been getting Q5s quicker than expected - don't ask me though what they expect vs how quick they arrive but they'd said they'd seen an improvement...Ours left factory whenever I posted the screenshot (2-3 weeks ago) was build week 30 I think (24th July) and still on status 30 on the background tracker when I checked earlier this week.To be honest so busy with work don't get time to check ????","August 24, 2017"

The tracking at Mexico side is really really poor. They were also surprised at the speed at which the Q5s were arriving. They had been told expect up to 24 weeks from BW for the car to get to you but this hasn't been the case recently.Fingers crossed it is just a tracker delay - have you checked the background tracker at all? ????????Click to expand...Hi Nemo.thanks for the reassurance.

MikeWM,"Justanhonestman said:Hi MikeWM can you tell us if the cupholders between the front seats are illuminated. The reason I ask is when I placed my order last November illuminated cupholders were part of the extended light package costing £150. When I and others took delivery of our cars, the cupholders were not illuminated. The dealer shrugged this off as a mistake in the configurator. I notice the configurator has stopped listing the cupholders as illuminated in the extended light package, but is listing them as standard fitting on the Q5. So either they are now fitting illuminated cupholders as standard now, or the configurator is still wrong. While in talks with Audi C/S about my brake pedal noise, I complained about the cupholders being listed wrongly. C/S said they will look into this and report back when they phone me to find out if my master brake cylinder replacement has worked.Click to expand...As far as I can see, the cupholders are not illuminated, but it's hard to be certain in daylight, I'll write again if that changes.

Obviously I wouldn't really care too much if they wasn't as I didn't pay to have it not did i actually know they light up until instead this thread forcing me to pay a little more attention to it. But for those who have paid for them it it's pretty snakey of Audi to rob you like that. FYI I have the basic led interior lighting.,"October 9, 2017"
Justanhonestman,Hi MikeWM thanks for the feedback. It doesn't look like they have started to include illuminated cupholders as standard as their configurator says. The top of the cupholders would have a recessed groove around the circumference of the cupholder which the lighting is positioned into. Gives me ammunition when C/S phone. Cheers.,"October 9, 2017"

At first I thought it was a bit of invasion of privacy that your next door neighbour can tell you that your car failed it’s MOT for whatever reason etc. But it was introduced to reduce fraud. So now when you go to look at a car you can check previous history or if the milage is correct and if the car had any advisories that may cost you money before the next MOT.

When you do this, the back of your trousers/ jeans rub against the edge of the runner and if it's been raining or you have gone through mud, then the back of your trousers will have some of that gunk on them as you rub against the runner on leaving the car. I think it is Range Rover that have an option to have a step that comes out from under the side of the car when the door is opened and returns when the door is closed. Some people like the runners, some don't. I feel it makes the car look lower than it really is. I like the look but would suggest you try getting in and out ( especially out ) before making your decision. CheersClick to expand...You are right about the muck etc, forgot about this problem as I also had this problem with side runners on a land rover discovery many years ago! I have also seen the side runners as you have described on the Range Rover that retract during driving they really are brilliant but if memory serves me right they are over £2k","October 18, 2017"

PRT,"Justanhonestman said:Yup -- from experience and waiting on a replacement brake servo being fitted. While out on your test drive bring your foot smartly off the brake pedal after braking and listen out for a tinny 'clang' noise. You will also experience a lag from the gearbox when you take off from a junction or try to enter a roundabout smartly in heavy traffic. It can be unerving at first as you seem to be going nowhere as traffic heads towards you as you creep out into their path. Once you learn to anticipate your move you learn to hit the gas pedal a little earlier than normal. As with any new car it's a learning curve, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a nice drive. Don't want to wait 9 months ? There are lots of low milage and well speced cars out there. The decision is all yours. It's a shame that the clanging brake pedal has spoiled some owners expectations of their new 'luxury' car. This problem should never have got past quality control considering the cars were checked at Mexico and apparently checkedd at Emden before delivery.

I'll maybe give one a whirl to see how it compares though!I've been eyeing up a Macan too but I think it might suffer from old tech syndrome too. The one with all the tech just now is the RR Velar.

I had been reading on another forum where somebody with an A4 had contacted customer services about the miserly 3 month trial. He got an extra 12 months free added to his 'trial.So I went to Audi UK's website and a red 'live chat' window opened up on the right hand side of the page. Entered my question into the window asking why Audi only gave a 3month trial considering the cost of the car and saying that I thought it was a yearly trial that was included.The customer services rep asked what I thought of the car and went through a few questions as to why my sat - nav had stopped. I think he thought it was broken rather than an expired license. He asked for my reg number and then confirmed the model and colour etc related to my reg. He said he had driven the same model a few weeks ago and enjoyed it-- of course I agreedHe then asked if it was ok for him to give me a free 12 month extension onto my license which might take around 5 days to activate the system again. Of course I agreed again and thanked him for the kind gesture. So in this case I take back any doubts I had about Audi c/s and gave them 5 stars in the question at the end of the live talk.So if your license has expired recently, it might be worth a shot with their live chat or phone direct to the number he gave me - 0800699888.Be polite and say you didn't expect such a short trial considering the price of the car etc.According to some other forums, Audi were supposed to include a 12 month trial for UK cars without the tech pack.

So the car went in and the repair was completed.About 2 weeks ago a letter came thru my door from Audi telling me the were now offering warranty work on the EGR on all cars with the update.

Ransman,"I guess we are in danger of repeating an earlier thread but, in the UK, HGV's can travel at 56mph so anything slower is acting as a rolling road block which potentially causes lots of problems on a busy motorway.

Here, multi-lane highways are common, and minimum speeds are posted (they're typically 45 MPH when not posted).

Although I might still be open to persuasion, I think I have already ruled out the Audi own version as it looks quite cheap at first glance but the annual charge starts to rise steeply after the first year and does NOT include any breakdown cover. That leaves my Audi dealer (Inchcape) selling their own version which is provided by Car Care Plan - they will sell a 3 year policy for under £1100 which seems a lot but, like any insurance, might start looking quite cheap if a claim needs to be paid out on an expensive component - it also includes breakdown cover.Has anybody had any experience (either positive or negative) of extended warranty policies in general and the Inchcape / Car Care Plan one in particular?Any early views would be much appreciated as I need to make a decision by the end of this week.","August 14, 2017"

Justanhonestman,"Hi JEvMar-- I didn't take the tyre and wheel protection package when I bought my car. But the salesman went through what it covered with me. From what I remember it covered any puncture repairs and/or damage that required the tyre or wheel to be replaced or repaired. The way the salesman put it over, you were covered just about for anything that happened to your tyres or wheels with a limit on the number of claims you could make within the warranty period. Maybe some other members here have taken out the protection package and could be more specific of what it covers. I take it the UK warranty should be the same as the Canadian one. I would be very wary driving around with bulges in my tyres though. Best of luck.","August 11, 2017"

Justanhonestman,Hi JP Oxfordshire- the only difference I have picked up on so far is that in Efficiency mode the gears change at lower revs as you progress. In this mode I usually reach gear 7 at around 50-52 mph. In Dynamic mode the gears change at higher rev levels which give you better acceleration by staying in lower gears for longer- but uses more fuel. Not sure how the suspension is adjusted between modes in non air suspension models though. Seems the steering tightens up in dynamic mode too requiring less input providing sharper steering compared to efficiency.,"July 15, 2017"

After 436 miles she took 41 litres, which works out at 48.3mpg and this compares to the OBC showing 50.1mpg so it's only 3.5% out which is less than I have had on some previous Q5's.

Skiman,"Justanhonestman said:I think most of us are enjoying our new Q5s. I feel after looking at the F-Pace, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Evoque etc that I have made the right choice and have enjoyed every drive since I finally received my car.I don't think anybody recently has had major quality issues that stopped them using their car either.I think when little niggles or issues are found, the sense of disappointment is increased because of the experience a lot of us went through with dealers and Audi customer services giving conflicting reasons as to why our cars had not arrived.It didn't help when after being told by the dealers that the delays were due to extra quality checks being carried out, then still finding faults or niggles when you got your car.Did nobody look inside the two opening side pockets in my boot to notice the insulating material laying in a heap on top of the fuses ? Remember - this is a luxury SUV from a major manufacturer costing £40000 plus. I cannot see any means to keep this material in place like sticky pads or velcro etc. Repositioned it myself and hope it stays in place. My locking wheel nut release bolt and wheel nut cover removal tool were missing. Sure - not life threatening but could have stranded me somewhere when needed. Passengers door sill illuminating S-line kickplate not working- again not serious but bloody annoying that this was not picked up either which will require a return visit to the dealer. Then we come to the clanging brake pedal which seems to lack any damping as it returns to its normal position after being pressed. Did nobody hear this or want to hear the clanking ? And according to one member Audi are replacing the brake servo to stop the clanging which implies the brake pedal is not being damped on its return motion. Nobody heard this during the 'extra checks ' ?But we have to take into account that this is a new venture for Audi in Mexico. Thousands of people had to be trained. It all takes time and mistakes will be made till the factory is up and running proper with the workforce settled into their jobs.Most niggles or issues are minor and were missed by the new and unexperienced work force in Mexico. But should not have been missed at Germany.Hopefully delivery times will decrease as problem areas get ironed out . Is there lessons to be learned about ordering the first models in a new range ? Who knows- but I am enjoying my car and putting the delivery issues behind me. For those contemplating ordering and may be concerned by some of the posts in the forum - don't be. Most of the niggles were or are very minor and didn't stop us enjoying the car but were exasperated by the ordeal a lot of us went through when waiting on delivery.The only advice I could give is to agree a part exchange value on your car when ordering - and get it in writing and signed. The other advice is- stick with it, you will love the car when it arrivesClick to expand...After reading your post, I have just checked my rear side pockets in the boot. Mine are the same as yours. Cannot believe how the sound insulation has just been thrown in and no real attempt to fasten it down. It looks terrible, thankfully it is out of sight. Personally if I had been the person fitting the insulation in this manner I would have been embarrassed to have turned out this standard of workmanship.","May 26, 2017"
Justanhonestman,"Hi Skiman - thanks for the reply. It's little things like this that get my back up lol. It may have been fitted correctly at the factory, but as there is nothing to keep it in place it will fall down over time with movement etc. Makes you wonder what state the rest of the insulation is in around the car.. Cheers","May 26, 2017"
Skiman,"I dread to think.My wife's new mk3 Audi TT Roadster, was quite noisey compared to our previous TTR's. On inspection I noticed that several areas in the boot had no or little insulation. I purchased on eBay some self adhesive 10ml automotive sound insulation it cost about a tenner. What a difference it has made. It is just a shame that I had to do this in a premium brand car. If it had been a cheap car then I would not have minded so much. Car manufacturers also seem to be boasting about how much lighter their cars are becoming. I guess this is at the expense of such things as decent sound insulation materials and reducing the quality of other components.","May 26, 2017"

I am waiting on feedback from Audi as to what they are going to do with my noisy brake pedal. But even if the part was on back order, there is no reason to keep the car in the garage. Surely they wouldn't strip out a servo before the part had arrived. I think dealers will be in contact with Audi UK reporting this problem and waiting for answers from them as they themselves will be checking out that area on other cars. Is there a recall coming ? Audi will do their utmost to prevent another recall being announced so soon after the emissions hoo ha. Lets hope they find a fast fix with little disruption to customers. Hopefully this is only going to affect early cars. It could end up a costly excercise for Audi when you take into account the cost of these repairs and hire cars etc, not to mention the impact on Audi's already tarnished reputation.

Majortom,"Hi Guys,Been a while since I posted but just sharing a recent experience. Thinking Audi extended warranty is not worth the paper its written on. Extended it for my R8 last month (2013 V10 plus) then noticed after cleaning it the other week was getting moisture in the NSR light cluster, fast forward 2 weeks and the lense bonding is failing to its starting to come away from the main unit. Took it into the dealer 2 weeks ago to then be told today they declined it!!!Spoke to the warranty people direct and they tell me its not covered even though I have ""All Component Cover""!!!Rediculous!!!MT","June 7, 2017"
Nemo,How random is that - did they say why it wasn't covered? I'd have thought with it being all component it would've been?I've always had it on previous cars when the option has come up and admittedly have been lucky as the couple of issues that have cropped up have been covered by them.Are they classing lense bonding as wear and tear?,"June 2, 2017"
Majortom,"Yes they are classifying the bonding as a seal (i.e rubber = perishable) which is not the case. Been in contact with them and explained it as evidently the dealers description is the issue and they are going back to the dealer to clarify. Now getting hold of the dealer is proving painful, not returning calls or emails. Getting very fed up with them now, considering I own 3 Audi's (R8, SQ5 & mk3 TT) all purchased in the last 3 years you would think I would be a valued customer. Their arrogance will be their undoing in this case!!If anyone is wondering the dealer in question is Southampton Audi. VERY POOR service so far!MT","June 7, 2017"

Justanhonestman,"Hi PRT interesting reading for sure. I read another article on the logistical problems Audi were having to overcome. I also read an article about the port of Veracruz and how because so many manufacturers were using the same port, they could only hold a shipment of cars for 10 to 14 days as there is not enough holding areas for everybody. I feel this move to Mexico was to pander more to the American market to reduce their delivery times tp the USA. Maybe things will smooth out once the plant gets up and running with a fully trained workforce. Surely these long delivery times to the UK cannot continue.","June 4, 2017"

Justanhonestman,Hi Rubyslad - lets hope it is down to work on improving the way customers can track their cars and make it more accurate and informative. Not being able to track your car from when it left Mexico till it was loaded onto a boat heading to the UK is a waste of time and just creates anger and confusion between customer and dealrship. Even trying to track the ship your car is on is a guess as the updates you receive can be 4 or 5 days behind the actual event.,"May 25, 2017"

Sj1000,"Justanhonestman said:Hi guys- about the price increases. When I ordered my Q5 S-Line last November you could order electric front seats separatly from electric mirrors. Somebody somewhere must have noticed that they run off the same memory module so the two options bacame one. When I ordered my car the electric seats were £700 and the mirrors £250.Now when you tick the electric seats option, another window opens up telling you that the seats must be ordered in conjunction with electric mirrors with memory. So that's £200 extra right away. Seats are now £800 and mirrors £350 Then there was the increase in road tax for cars over £40000. That took the first years tax/showroom tax to £500. In the configurator the picture of the standard S-Line steering wheel does not show the aluminium finishing piece with the S-Line logo. The lighting pack says the cupholders are illuminated along with the doors/footwells etc They are not- I got the extended lighting pack and they still have no lighting whatsoever.If Audi cannot get their configurator right, that attitude of not listening to or caring about their customers must surely filter down to production level. The Q5 prices used to start around £32500 to £37-38000. Now they start around £37500 or there abouts- for what ? That's a helluva price increase for a car that doesn't offer much more than the previous model. An increase in the amount of plastic around the interior, and a nice new front grille made of plastic all being fitted by a low paid workforce, all combine to line Audi's pockets with a fair bit of extra cash.

And, as such until the Q5 gets further down I can't see Audi releasing exterior upgrades, wheels, black pack etc. I've not considered the current SQ5 as I was worried about the bridge over but I'll have a look into it.","November 29, 2016"

Sj1000,"The only way to save some money is to try and avoid the trade in, i.e (try to) sell yours privately then go cash in hand for next one.Would be a hassle probably, but you could try on here for starters to see if any interest.It seems a lot of people (including me) are happy they've bought the last model of current version, so when it's no longer available new, there should be a decent market for 'nearly new' like yours.","November 29, 2016"

SteveMcB,"Don't go to wbac, dealer margins on SQS are only about £2K at the moment and they are paying well above top CAP.I know nothing about Tesla but am guessing the dealership probably have Audi somewhere on their books as well. They'll just move it to another branch and put a £40k sticker on it.","December 5, 2016"
GRANDDUC,"Would imagine Audi dealer margins are likely to be around £3-4,000 as if they are based on what I have been offered on mine minus what it costs to 'showroom it up' the ticket price on forecourt will no doubt be around the £40,000 mark.","December 6, 2016"

skotl,"I really wouldn't use WBAC as a barometer. Any time I've looked at them, their price has been woeful.Best looking at Autotrader for private sales and find what those closest to your spec, year and mileage are selling at. Those at the lower end of the range have probably already advertised at the higher prices and got no bites. I've had most success selling on AT at lowest price +5% or so.","December 6, 2016"
Snow Man,"AT is not going to give you any indication as to what to expect from a trade in, its a resale price.Audi who use CAP and WBAC are the market barometers IMO.","December 7, 2016"
skotl,"sj1000 is absolutely correct - trying to sell at less than a year or two is just throwing money away.But to both sj1000 and snow man, my point was absolutely about what you could expect in a private sale rather than a trade sale.

Snow Man,"Q5 is showing its age, you cant hide that. The current car is behind many of the mercs i tested over the last few weeks.","December 8, 2016"
GRANDDUC,"Its actually irrelevant what marque it is just that its 10ish year old technology that Audi are expecting you to pay the thick end of £50,000 in order to get from 0-62 in 5.1 seconds. If you take £50,000 and go shopping for another marque with similar spec you will be surprised what you can get that has modern technology driving it. I have no problem with my SQ5 its my second Audi in recent years the first being a Q5 and yes they are fine but lets not fool ourselves into thinking that they are cutting edge as when you buy a SQ5 most people are only interested in how fast it goes otherwise they would buy a Q5, surely? As for those who say they want diesel etc not sure how strong an argument that is nowadays.","December 8, 2016"
Snow Man,"SteveMcB said:Fair enough point re the age thing, but surely it's no worse a car now that it was a year or two back? I ordered mine last November with eyes wide open about likely impact of the new one. I spent much more time mulling this decision over than any other purchase I've ever made, including property, and think that's why I'm still happy.I was a cash buyer so know little of PCPs etc but the thought of basically giving away a car that I was happy with just a few months ago doesn't sit well with me at all.I had a hankering after a Macan recently but another decent run in the SQ (and slap about the head) sorted out that wibble.As far as being behind Merc, I don't know about that, except for a 10 yr old SL I haven't driven any for a while. It genuinely wouldn't matter to me if their residuals are better (are they?) because I just don't like them.Click to expand...I just don't know in terms to resales values, sorry.Worse/better? well the position changes as you compare to other models around at the point in time.It would be fair to say if you had a utopian ""best"" list, the Q5 will have steadily dropped down the list as it aged and or newer (competing) models are released.","December 8, 2016"
GRANDDUC,"Actually I don't see it as that much of a hit for a car about to end its days. I couldn't hire an SQ5 for £700 a month and got a good discount (nearly £7,000) -had to search it out and discount beats all on-line broker deals- most Mercedes dealers think that if you can afford a Merc then you can afford to pay list. Eh no, I don't think so!! Overall its only costing me £11,000 plus what I got for my car for the new Mercedes but if I was foolish enough to pay full list it would not have been a goer in the first place so taking away the £7,000 from depreciation costs brings it down to around £3,500 and that's fine with me for a new model AMG car.","December 8, 2016"
GRANDDUC,Strange you should ask my brother bought a new 911 and he let me drive it around for a week or so and it does its job well but in the end I need a load lugger so for the moment it has to be an estate type car but may take his off his hands when it changes it in a couple of years as he's just like me with cars.................. just to add the 911 is well overpriced for what you get better off staying with your SQ5.,"December 8, 2016"
SteveMcB,"New 911s are very, very nice but the 718 Cayman is much better value IMO - absolutely no use as a load lugger though. Mind you, you could always buy a Macan with the change - nuts!","December 8, 2016"
GRANDDUC,"Yes its crazy really and I understand that the 911 is 'The' Iconic sports car but the prices are staggering even Porsche SUVs are silly money, but Porsche get away with it and their 'no discount' policy helps keep used prices high but when buying it hurts that you cannot do a deal which is what I like to do when spending new car money. All in all a car is just a means of transport so I never get too attached to mine and over the years have never kept a car for a long time its just the way I am. In the end its pointless comparing one car with another as they all effectively do the same job but some do it faster or more luxuriously than another but you pays your money you take your choice.","December 8, 2016"

malph,"Not been approached like you rifleman, but we stopped by our dealer the other day to look at the new Q5 and the guy who sold us our car said something similar. I got the feeling they're looking for nearly new, low mileage, high value cars for used stock that will still command the lower VED rates that applied pre April 1st. I think they've taken a bit of a hit with orders of £40k+ cars after the VED increase and are looking to help their figures along!.... Just my tuppence worth.","May 3, 2017"

rifleman,not good news at all.i was approached by Audi regarding my last Q5 when it was 29 months old telling me it was the best time to sell.my current Q5 is just 13 months old when approached by Audi telling me it is the best time to sell.that's quite a concerning difference in a car's peak value age just because there is a new kid on the block.,"May 17, 2017"

SteveMcB,"It seems a bit odd that the dealer's trying to persuade you to change so soon, makes me wonder what their angle is but one thing's for sure any deal will be to their benefit and probably not yours?FWIW my opinion is that your current car is a very nice example so, if it still meets your needs, be content with it for at least a couple more years, at least until the new model is more firmly established and we know what effect the new VEL rules are having on the second hand market for cars just the wrong side of £40K, ie new Q5 territory.I plan on keeping mine for a lot longer than that.","May 18, 2017"

Skiman,"stevew said:Audi CS'Thanks for providing these details, Steve. We've spoken to the Audi Sales Office who've advised it's in transit from the Factory to Emden, this status change took place on 24 March 2017. It will then be transported by ship from Emden to Grimsby. The lead time from logistics is usually around 12 weeks for the vehicle to arrive in the UK. We're happy to keep providing updates if you'd like to check back with us.'Dealer'Great news is that it is built and still showing in transit from factory! I will continue to keep an eye on your new Q5 but it seems to be in that grey area somewhere between Mexico and Germany right now.'Along with the 'yourAudi' tracker showing a ship and the ocean, I assumed just that... the car was on a ship on its way to Germany. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and on a later requested for an update, they said it had 'left port' on 19th April so only from then was it actually moving across the ocean.All very frustrating in this day and age as most of us waiting are. I even asked a few times what ship the car was on but rather than 'it hasn't actually left on a ship yet Mr Williams' I was just told they didn't have that information.Perhaps I'm / we're craving too much information these days and should just wait until the 6 months (advised lead time) from order is up before asking questions?!Sent from my iPhone using TapatalkClick to expand...I don't think in this day and age (particularly with modern technology) it's unrealistic to be be given accurate or honest information about the status of your considerable purchase. Clearly something doesn't appear right particularly with the apparent blockage at Emden.

Turns out it wasn't, the dealer admitted it's sacrilege to not have it these days hence him asking £2k less for the car than most others.

Still no sign of my car with the dealer now saying all Q5's coming from Mexico are taken back to the original Q5 factory in Germany for further 'quality checks' before being taken back to Emden to be shipped to the UK. There is something going on that customers are not being told. Has Mexican build quality turned out not as expected ? Why further checks at the original factory in Germany ? And still the dealer cannot tell me where my car is or when it is expected in the UK. I will keep members posted of my progress - or lack of it.,"April 14, 2017"

If they had been aluminium as on the previous A6 Allroad I would have been more impressed but they seem to be silvery-grey plastic which i suspect will start to look scruffy when they have been exposed to road debris thrown up by the wheels. The faux exhaust trim in silvery plastic was also a bit of a retrograde step in my opinion compared to the polished stainless steel exhaust tips fitted previously. If Skoda can fit proper polished stainless steel exhaust tips to it's 4x4 Superb why is Audi hiding the exhaust under the car and putting unconvincing bits of exhaust shaped plastic on the valance?Looking @ the S-Line photo it looks as though the the rear valance panel flares out as on the mark 1 & 1.5 model so wondering if someone @ Milton Keynes has given consideration to supplying S-Line compatible mud flaps this time around. Difficult to see if the side skirt will affect front flap fitment and the salesman I met today was very honest stating that he had no idea mud flaps were even available for any Q5 model.Overall I like the car but one other thing, apart from the stick on information screen, that let it down inside was the hard plastic door pull which felt cheap compared the stitched leather covering on my car and the padded soft touch plastic of A4 & A6s I have owned before. The salesman thought that S line models might softer trim on the door pull but did not have a vehicle on site to look at to confirm this.We discussed the new Road Fund Licence fee for vehicles > £40k but I guess one just swallows this if one likes the car unless you can do without leather & metallic paint.Click to expand...I have the SLINE.

mhg,I have a 2 Q5 s line plus that will be 3 years old in July and am looking to change for a new one.However the dealer I did the deal through has come back with a very low value for my car- this month it is just over the GFV for July set 3 years ago but they are suggesting no new car until September it will then be under GFV.How is this possible when the whole purpose of PCP is you have some residual to put down as a deposit ( it is under mileage and in immaculate condition) and the value they have give in around 5 K under the same spec cars they are selling on the audi website currently.?It is one affected by the emissions fiasco so I wondered if this is why and is there anyone else who has had this and been able to secure a higher value?Its the first time doing PCP and they positioned it at sale time that you wouldn't definitely have a higher value than the GFV when changing over or I would not have gone with PCP.Any advice welcome?,"April 3, 2017"

rifleman,surely a lower GFV is better when you trade it in and the car is worth more than they reckon and you come away with more equity to use as a deposit for a new one?that's what i did last time - low GFV - car was worth a lot more after 3yrs - used the equity to buy new Q5.if it was worth less than GFV i would have no equity and no new Q5.,"April 3, 2017"

You will have the same order number on SLiSome options are on delayed release and if you selected one of those then it causes a replan at the factory and a new BW.Remember the dealer can not influence the build date and removing the change made is no guarantee you will get moved forward either...A tip from me would be: you can ""ask"" the dealer to simulate a change and look what the impact will be before you do anything...","January 14, 2017"

Ransman,"My build date has now gone back to w/c 3rd April.The dealer had given me a price on my car assuming March delivery and I had specced the new one to meet my budget based on that p/x price. If they cannot honour that price then the deal may be off.Still, it's not as though I am slumming it in my current car so it won't be a disaster.","February 1, 2017"
Sj1000,"I very much doubt they will try to change deal financially, based on their own delivery dates changing","February 1, 2017"
Ransman,When I placed the order in November they anticipated a delivery in March so we are now talking a three month shift to that date based on anticipated transit times post build.,"February 2, 2017"
Sj1000,"Oh I thought it was only a month difference.Anyway, I still don't believe they will change the deal you've signed up for, even though your own car is probably depreciating £4-500 per month.","February 2, 2017"
Snow Man,"Tax is separate, they do have something in the Ts and Cs about it...I cant see Audi paying it - they will keep the car price, but the OTR will change. (is my guess).","February 2, 2017"
Ransman,"The dealer had thought only one month for delivery post build not three.I spoke to him today and he confirmed that it is still build week 7 (some confusion as they placed an order for me in advance of me confirming the spec I wanted) and they think three months for delivery is ""very much the worst case"". Still, at least he knows my position.","February 2, 2017"
Snow Man,"They will do that with the price of the car, but normally you will see a comment in the T&Cs around on road costs or VAT..You need to check with your dealer ""if"" the cost is over 40k as that will add too.Basic diesel now is about £165, vs £200, then the uplift for £40k+ is another £310 on top","February 3, 2017"

secretwookie,13 plate Q5 went into Harrogate Audi for service and emissions work last week.

This is a new one on me but when I drove home and saw the newer Audis with LEDs, I noticed the same. All weather LEDs according to the salesman.Other than that, I loved the new interior, it's a real step up.Saw 3 different colours there: the blue, black and Daytona. Out of those I liked Daytona the most but have it on my current Q5. Saw a few photos of the silver that I've ordered at the Q5 launch in Hastings and pleased I picked that particular colour.Ride was exceptionally smooth IMO but it had 19 inch wheels rather than the 20's I'm running.

So I take this info with a pinch of salt. Again my experience dealers will try and give you as little as they think you will accept.I can almost image my conversation when I come to part exchange my 2017 Q5 in three years time, it will go something like "" I know it's £3k less than book but we just cannot get rid of diesels anymore if it had been a petrol version then we could have offered more""","March 16, 2017"

VAG can't sell diesels in North America since Dieselgate, and the anti-diesel rhetoric is strong.On the flip side, I'm driving my first Audi, first SUV, first AWD, and first diesel (3.0L). I never want to go back to a gasoline (petrol) engine! I get a massive 428 ft-lbs of torque, with 0-60 mph acceleration in about 6.4sec.Andif I treat is super gently on the highway (under ideal conditions), I've got as good as nearly 52 MPG (US) = nearly 62 MPG Imp. I'm sold on diesel, Dieselgate notwithstanding.","February 17, 2017"
Skiman,I currently own an A6 3.0l avant coming from a 2.0l q5 TDI . I am now looking to go back to the q5. I do love the low down torque of diesels but given the bad press at the moment not sure which one to go far. I always buy my cars so concerned about what the market will think in 3 years time.When I was in Austria I saw several Audi events promoting the q5 every one was a petrol version perhaps just a coincidence? As said previously will only be doing about 10k per year so as long as the real world driving mpg is ok would consider petrol (I think).,"February 18, 2017"
JamesSQ,"For me I'm happy with diesel the emissions scandal was probably enevitable with one major manufacturer so as far as I'm concerned it's not relevant. If it's a race car you want then yes petrol is better but you wouldnt be driving a q5! You'd have an rs4 or rs6. For me the sq5 is a great all rounder relatively fast, relatively economical, cheap tax for power figures and size and with the trick exhaust it gives you the sound of a v8 so happy days really. The cost of petrol in USA I would quite happily have a petrol version as it's only about 50 pence a litre and they don't sell the diesel sq over there","February 18, 2017"
PRT,"As I said previously I have ordered a new 2.0 TDI diesel Q5 but had second thoughts after Mayor Khans directives and nearly every day this week the Daily Mail spelling doom for every diesel car owner. After a lot of thought and conversation with my dealer have decided to stick with the diesel, I have decided that if choosing a smaller 4 cylinder engine SUV, diesel is the way to go, I just think it suits the style of driving I do in a SUV, like James said ""if its a race car you want then yes petrol is better"" which for me sums it up in a nutshell !","February 18, 2017"
Rubicon,It's a shame that people still want to buy a diesel cars. I absolutely hate to inhale those toxic fumes when taking a walk in the city. That for me is enough to not choose a diesel.,"February 18, 2017"
Rubicon,"Sorry if my post got a bit OTT maybe and out of context since I put it so short. Thing is that I have myself owned several diesels. Audi SQ5 is one of them, but I sold that one over a year ago. Right now in a Macan Turbo - pleased with the car, but not with the drivetrain. Live in a big city and for me the next car must be a hybrid or a full EV. Have test driven a Tesla Model S and that might be my next car. That instant torque is just unbelievable. Future is clearly EV and I'm a bit irritated that we have to wait several years before the germans can come up with any decent alternatives.","February 18, 2017"
missile,"22-25mpg from a Macan Turbo is Walter Mitty taking Miss Daisy for a drive. Tesla is the best of the rest, but still a joke if you want to travel any distance. Spending an hour waiting for the batteries to charge is not my idea of progress.","February 19, 2017"
missile,"My view is based on actual experience. Tesla 100 % charge leaving Aberdeen, 1 hour charge at Perth. We did have a blast round and set the lap record for an electric car around Knockhill circuit. Unlike most petrol stations, Tesla supercharge never seem to be conveniently located beside coffee shops.","February 20, 2017"
SwingKing,"EV's will only really take off once fast charging stations are as commonplace as a petrol pump. My wife has an i3, and as great a little car as it is, she (and I) do get range panic at times. In reality, it does the job great and the 2 stroke range extender is a godsend, but I won't consider changing the main car to electric until I can stop at a 'gas' station and re-charge in 15 mins without finding the charging station is out of service, or there is a 2 hour wait etc. Great idea, maybe not quite ready for general mass consumption yet.","February 20, 2017"
Sj1000,"Rubicon said:Hehe, true regarding the Macan Turbo mpg. That's with cruise control engaged following the speed limits. If driving spirited the fuel consumption get's really nasty. I changed to this car from an 2013 SQ5 and that had great mpg in comparison. Still Macan is a very nice car. Regarding the Tesla charging I think you do the same mistake as many do who actually haven't tested and just read stuff on the internet. The 1 hour charging time is just a misconception actually. I've done some long road trips together with a friend of mine who have a Tesla. You just start off with a full charged battery from home, then you drive for let's say 2-3 hours without stopping (motorway driving). then you take a break at a super charger for 15-20 minutes and during that time you load up with approx 150 new miles. So you never in real life run the battery from 100 -> 0. You run it in the area of 20-80%. And in this region the charging is much quicker at the supercharger. Fact is that it takes equally long to charge between 80->100% as it takes to charge between 20->60%. No Tesla owner charge 90->100% on road trips to make it that 1 hour stop over. I've done a couple of 500 miles trips in Teslas. They usually require 3 stop overs of 20 minutes each. Which is perfect for taking a coffee, a bite and some fresh air. Actually who doesn't on a roadtrip? You NEVER need to stop over for 1 hour. Maybe require longer stops if you have any of the smaller batteries or run any of the older Teslas. But for instance the new 100kw battery pack will come very close to running a ICE car on a road trip. To tell the truth - my favorite road trips are actually in Teslas because you're less fatigue when arriving to the destination. And if you take a 7 hour roadtrip, if you loose let's say 30 minutes running in a Tesla would that be a big issue for you? Just asking. If I can't spare 30 minute on that trip I'd take a flight and a taxi. There are lot's of preconceptions that in real life are just not relevant. And one other thing is that you don't need to spend time hassling with card payment when you fill up and moving the car after you're done with filling up and park it up somewhere else when you need to visit the rest room and buy a coffee. There you save another few minutes of time and sum it all up and I would estimate that each stop over takes 5 minutes more in a Tesla. It's quite far off from that hour. And also keep in mind that on a 500 miles roadtrip you probably stop for let's say 40 minutes on one occasion to eat some more. Then you can charge a bit more on that stop and stay shorter on the other two. So the split will be 10 minutes, 40 minutes, 10 minutes. Also, each morning you wake up with a fully charged car. And I wonder how many ppl who drive 250+miles many days a year? Because if you don't you never need to visit a petrol station because your car is always fully charged when you wake up in the morning. Brilliant! Of course for it to work smooth it is for convenience a must to have access to overnight charing. For those not having this I can understand that it ain't as convenient. But if you have an expensive car I assume you want to have it garaged anyway and soon there will be charging capabilities in every garage if there already isn't.

It seems pointless in that you come to a halt with foot on the brake, the engine turns off but will restart as soon as you release the pedal, even when stationary in a queue with HHA activated. It would make more sense - to me anyway - if it cut in after a longer stationary period, say 20 seconds and the restart was linked to the throttle instead of the brake.Keep meaning to get it coded so it defaults to off.","December 22, 2016"

I ordered one before they were released and have not been disappointed.DittoPros:Performance - It is rapid, certainly more than quick enough for our roads, smooth delivery with no throttle delay or flat spots. Slick gearbox.DittoHandling - I've not had the opportunity to really push an SQ5 so can't comment on how they handle but with the sports diff on the plus it corners like it's on rails. I could go on about the diff all day, it's witchcraft how it pushes the car tighter into the corner and impresses me every time I drive it. Zero understeer, from the driver's perspective one of the car's best features. Brakes on mine seem fine, never had a hint of fade.DittoLooks - extended black pack IMO looks better than chrome on most colours and sets the car off. It'll contrast well with the white.Ditto with SepangCabin - very, very nice place to be, diamond seats look the part and are very comfortable ( can sometimes feel a bit too warm though). Good quality materials used throughout, the piano black trim on mine is nice although some have commented that the aluminium is a bit fragile. Clear, intuitive, instrument panel and switch gear. I've not noticed any cheap looking bits except for the foot rest which I replaced.Mostly ditto although I detest the aluminium look (but actually plastic) steering wheel gear selectors. They feel horribly cheap.Exhaust - obviously fake but a nice sound none the less. I put a kufatec on mine but probably should have saved my money.No Kaufatec for me.Towbar - if you've got it - is very neat and surprisingly cheap.Got and fully agree.ConsSpare wheel - none! I was told the collapsible was no longer supplied as standard to keep weight and emissions down. I found that explanation even less believable after the scandal broke. They can still be fitted under the boot floor but are approx £500 new.""Transferred"" from my earlier SQ5.Headlights - not really a 'con' as such but agree they could be better, the bulbs can be upgraded though. It would have been nice to have an LED option.Indifferent.Connect - not 4g compatible but seems to work fine on 3g.Agreed.Fuel consumption - heavier than figures suggest ( no surprise there though) but I can average 30+ without restraining myself too much. Easy to get into the 20s. I think adblue consumption might be on the heavy side as well.Averaging about 38mpg with occasional heavy right foot.Wheels - choice far too limited, very subjective but IMO the grey/diamond are a bit boring and the black/diamond a bit OTT. Style is OK but RS6 style would look better.Black / diamond ok with me.Deceptively fast - probably should be a 'pro' but it always seems to be going quicker than I think it is. I've set up the DIS to show the large digital speedo.Ditto x 10Door mirrors - too big, cause blindspots at roundabouts but you get used to it.DittoSunglasses holder and under seat storage - far too small, a complete joke.+1The cons are all pretty minor though, it's a great all rounder ( there's not many cars that can take a washing machine from 0-60 in 5 secs).Certainly the best car I've owned.3rd Q5 for me so tendency to agree.Click to expand...","September 12, 2016"

At least the 24l option should last for at least 7,000 miles according to my sums.Interesting that the standard capacity fuel tank has dropped from 75 to 65 litres, which I was a bit disappointed with until I realised that was approx the same % improvement in mpg so the range should be about the same. Let's hope that Audi are not pulling a fast one on this. Nobody will expect to get around 55mpg (unless you live in Canada of course) but the %age improvement would be worthwhile.At the end of the day I liked the press reports and I guess I am trusting VAG to do the right thing if any issues emerge.SteveClick to expand...Great spec chosen, these are exactly the options and model I would would choose.

Despite the similarities the new Q5 is really a new car so Audi will probably try to resist discounting. I really hope I am wrong and other forum members post details of deals/ discounts etc. Certainly the Mk3 TT was massively over priced at launch, so sales appeared slow hence the need for discounting.

GRANDDUC,"Yes for sure but its the interim period that you need to watch and also the VED tax hike will help a little more but if someone moves away from an SQ5 they are very likely to buy another car worth over £40,000 anyway.

Snow Man,"As long as you register before you get the existing tax levels.I dont believe the used SQ price will go anywhere but down - you never said, but I'm assuming the used prices haven't improved from the previous numbers.New model will be Audis excuse to over inflate the prices for BREXIT, but with OZ now looking to sue VW and the impeding 25k job loses it inevitable.On a plus note, now the existing Q5 is no more thats the last of the old Audi platforms gone so it should save them some money.","November 2, 2016"
GRANDDUC,"I think the reality is that anyone with over £30,000 to spend on a performance car will give serious thought to buying an older SQ5 compared with the new Q5 which even in standard spec will probably be near or over £40,000. The old Q7 was in a similar position when the new one came along and for a while prices held and slightly increased as the new model is seriously expensive. As for the tax if I decide to exchange my car I will try to do it before April 1 next year.","November 2, 2016"

I believe him to be good since he has done the same for his both BMWs and is an ex-Air Force engineer and owns a small plane as well (services himself).Now, my question is that which brand should I buy and from where?

jonnyspin,"yep. I have 20"" Audi wheels for my winter tyres and 21"" summers. It does make a positive difference to ride with the higher profile tyres, although the SQ5 is firmly sprung (but I like that) - and it has less suspension travel as it's lowered by 30mm - bumpy roads can still make the ride 'jiggly' though. Smooth roads are fine though. But remember it's not a limo, it's a sporty, fast or economical, familly load lugger.","October 31, 2016"

SteveMcB,"madeinstein said:CoolCurly: Interesting what you said about A4 Avant vs SQ5. I've got A3 S-Line with 225/40R18 and I find the ride quite a bit too firm especially in the city with all the bumps, potholes etc.. Would like to get a bit more comfort from Q5/SQ5 so 20'' might be the save option.This website has tyre height calculator, never realized that 40 on the tyre size is the ratiohttps://tiresize.com...ize-calculator/20'' SQ5 - 255/45R20 = 4.5inch height21'' SQ5 - 255/40R21 - 4.0inch height18'' A3 - 225/40R18 - 3.5inch heightClick to expand...Unless you prefer the look of the 20s I wouldn't be put off by the 21s. My A4 is an sline as well on 235/40 18s and like you I find it very firm, great on smooth roads but it can be quite harsh on poor surfaces. The SQ5 on 21s has a much better ride quality, not too firm but also compliant ( no bangs or crashes) and IMO is spot on.As you say a 40% aspect ratio on a 255 is actually not that low a side wall, nowhere near the rubber band look.","November 1, 2016"

I'm pretty sure I'm not unique in that respect, as the Q5 is not only Audi's best-selling model, but also the world's best selling SUV in its class (mid-size luxury).Jack up the price sufficiently and the Q5 becomes a lot less ""value for the dollar,"" and a lot less appealing.

cruicd,Sounds like the under-steer can be just as scary with a Haldex as the Honda system. From Missile's experience the settings in terms of how and when the system kicks in the rear drive may be different on performance orientated vehicles( TT & A3) compared to soft roaders (Yeti/Tiguan/Q3).

JamesSQ,I watched a good video on YouTube about how the Tiguan 4motion works which also uses haldex couplings. Basically it senses what wheel has the most traction and puts the power there so when cornering it will put power to the two side wheels on opposite side to direction your turning! from owning that car for last 3 years I never had a problem with how it worked you heard it clicking on and off every now and again but never really had it anywhere where I needed 4wheel drive.,"October 10, 2016"

tyke2,Hi are there any tyre gurus around?I have just treaded my A5 Black Edition for a Q5 Sline plus.I have a nearly new set of tyres on Audi rims. Size 245/40/18.

Well not by BMW standards anyway.","September 30, 2016"
Sq5john,"Whilst all the teaser pictures depicted a pretty ugly bus, the finished article is actually surprisingly elegant, it doesn't have the awkward proportions of the latest Q7. Audi could sell them by the bucket-load, I fear though after the exceedingly ambitious pricing of the Q2 launch the new Q5 will go the same way. Audi need to be careful as the competition is getting better.","September 30, 2016"
malph,"I've read all I can about the new Q5 on 'tinternet', and it all says it's being built in ""a brand new plant in Mexico"". Despite some on here saying that's only for the Americas/Pacific market and not Europe, I can't find anything to support that. Probably unfounded, but it does make me ask questions about potential build quality issues and long delivery times. If it turns out the Mexico thing is legit, I suppose it's a case of 'watch this space'!","September 30, 2016"
Sj1000,"I personally think that it's the best, more proportional looking out of the Q3, Q5 & Q7, although of course they're all in the same vein.Like a few posters have said, I'm glad I bought a 2016 Q5, giving myself a lot of breathing space, to see these new models out on the road, and read the test reviews.If reviews for ride quality, performance, etc, etc are positive, and I agree after a test-drive, I'm pretty sure I'll end up with one of these in a year or two.","September 30, 2016"
Ransman,"Before the new model was announced I had done an extensive review of other cars on the market that meet my ""practicality"" criteria and had whittled it down to two contenders.

JamesSQ,With my sq5 plus now in transit from Germany just wondering how the 40gb hdd and 20gb jukebox works. I.e. How to copy music to it? Delete / replace music. Also maybe a stupid question but what's the difference between the 2 apart from size? Also what size sd card can you put into the two card readers?On the same topic of this do you get the mmi cables with car either USB or lightening? I have in my VW and was planning on keeping the cables?,"September 28, 2016"
Snow Man,"20GB is the useable size for the jukebox. The rest of the drive is not available to use.You can coy off from and SD card MP3 files via the menu,Basically it's pointless, just put in a SDcard or USB drive and save effort/time.You can of course just use your phone over BT","September 27, 2016"

AlB82,"Hi everyone.I'm on the verge of buying a new Audi Q5 S-Line Plus in Sepang blue with the Extended Black Styling pack. It looks absolutely stunning and I'm extremely tempted but I have a few concerns.Firstly, I've only been able to test an S-Line plus with 20"" wheels and the ride felt fine (though it was on a decent quality road for about 15 minutes). I wonder putting 21s on will make the ride unbearable?The other concern I have is will having 21s on it make it unusable in the snow/rain and ice?

HB14,"Welcome AIB82, firstly great choice of car and colour! You will not be disappointed with the 21"" alloys. I have them and love the look they give, seeing a Q5 without them makes me really happy I made the decision to get the larger wheels. I did attended Goodwood FOS this year and it was very muddy to say the least, with being parked on a hill and offroad mode selected I didn't have any problems at all.The only downside I find is unless the tyre pressures are set right the car does feel very 'skitty' on the road.","September 8, 2016"
jonnyspin,"ride will suffer on bigger wheels - but I have them and they work for me.in winter, a few of us have a set of winter wheels and tyres (18-20"" or so).

CoolCurly,"Ive got the 21"" on my SQ5 and the ride of the car is actually better than the previous A4 Avant on 19 5 spoke Black Editions alloys.

Snow Man,You can always just remove the wheels and get smaller ones if that's the only worry. They are plug and play..Personally i didn't like the ride on 21s and i run super cars so I'm used to a hard ride. I also think the rubber band look is not good for a 4x4.,"September 8, 2016"
AlB82,Thanks for the replies and the advice about tyre pressure. So the good news is the dealer has managed to source a demonstrator car with 21s so I've arranged an extended test drive next week. I have put a deposit down subject to me liking the drive so one step closer.Also managed to squeeze another £500 out of him - beginning to think there is more discount there to be had though - they are dropping their prices too easily. What's the most anyone has got off a car? It's a stock car but aside from the Bang and Olufsen speakers is the exact spec I was after.,"September 8, 2016"
duke,"Have a look at the ride height, the Q5 on 21s doesn't have the lowered suspension of the SQ5Some people like the bambi on stilts look, so it might not be an issue for you, but it put me right off the combinationA member on here did manage to get Audi to lower it to SQ5 height though","September 9, 2016"
Sj1000,The wheel size doesn't make any difference to ride height does it?larger circumference wheel = less rubber ( lower profile tyres) cancels out the difference.I think having either 20's or 21's is a totally overrated issue that only the owner would even notice.,"September 9, 2016"
Snow Man,No diff to ride height. The Circumference of the wheel remains the same.,"September 10, 2016"
duke,"The ride height doesnt change, but the standard Q5 is higher than the SQ5So 21s show too much gap on the Q5 and make it look like its on stiltsNo one said anything about the wheel circumference changing lolIt's noticeable enough that some members nearly rejected the car, but like I said, some people don't care about things like that, so it might not be an issue to you","September 10, 2016"
Sj1000,"I'm not getting something,If the overall diameter of wheel+tyre remains unchanged, regardless of 19's, 20's, 21's, whatever, where does the increased 'gap' come from ?","September 10, 2016"
duke,"Just go and take a look at one, or search here for the members that got extended black pack and complained about it","September 10, 2016"
missile,"The perceived gap has nothing to do with wheel / tyre size. 21"" wheels look nice and appear to fill the arches better but this is an illusion.On standard suspension the Q5 sits 50mm higher than the SQ5. Previously one could specify Q5 S Line with sports suspension, but it seems this option is no longer available on Audi configurator.","September 10, 2016"
Snow Man,"It's still there, but it never lowered the ride height.

cruicd,"""Sure if money is not a consideration the 3.0 or even the SQ5 are more fun in a straight line, but no Q5 handles well through the corners (you could argue the fast ones less so) and so I get my sporty driving kicks in a car more dedicated to that purpose.""Agree that a Q5 is not exactly a chuckable vehicle, primarily due to its' high centre of gravity, but I would say it is much better in fast sweepers than lobbing it at a tight turn that would not phase a lower c of g vehicle like an A3 or Scirocco. The firmer damping and improved body control provided by the sports suspension, if you opt for this, improves things quite a bit on the twisty bits.","September 19, 2016"
SQ-Raphster,I would have thought the SQ5 would be the best in the corners due to being lowered sports suspension. It's the lowest Q5 model.,"September 20, 2016"
jonnyspin,180kg heavier? just the engine? I'm not sure I believe that. That's more than two big blokes.,"September 20, 2016"

gregor42b,Thanks all for your responses! Based on this discussion I have decided for 2.0 TDI 190hp (automatic). I have found used one (registered in 2015) with 40000 km. 40 000 is probably still OK for used car? It has been serviced regulary and has extended 2+2 warranty.,"September 23, 2016"
purephase,"40,000 km is quite high for a 1-1.5 year old car, but I suspect the only way to get to that number is to hammer it on the motorway at lowish revs which will do the engine no harm. A lot of people say they're not run in until they've done 100,000 km.You'll certainly get a good discount on the vehicle vs. a typical mileage example.","September 26, 2016"

I drove it 130 miles back down the A9, just before the cameras came online and was home in under 2 hours, average 46mpg, the best it has ever achieved.Outward leg was a hillier route and both figures were according to the DIS but I was pleasantly surprised at the return mpg.","September 12, 2016"

The technical data quoted in the Q5 official documentation brochure was printed in April 2015 and refers to the car as a model year 2016 with an EU 6 standard engine.As no one was publicly aware of the software cheat at the time the brochure was printed, or indeed at the time I ordered my car is it fair to assume one of the following1. The new car will also have dubious software fitted in order to meet the current standards2. it will not have software fitted and therefore the technical data as per the printed documentation will be incorrect and i will have no idea of the true technical data or performance of my new car.3. Audi already know what the effects of removing this software has on technical data and performance of recently built cars but are not willing to disclose it at this time.

GRANDDUC,I called Audi Customer Nervous sorry should have said Service about 3 weeks ago when the 3.0 diesel engines were implicated in the USA but have had no call back yet. Will wait a while longer to see if this story has any legs but I'm convinced that the bigger diesel engines will be implicated soon.,"November 24, 2015"
Candle,"Pg220 said:Haven't had a chance to view Panorama yet but heres an update on my storyOrdered a new Q5 in September for delivery next week. Emissions saga blew up not long afterwards.Contacted Audi UK on two occasions seeking reassurance that used values would not be affected and that the new vehicle was not fitted with any devices and was as described in technical data. No assurances were forthcoming, indeed no response was ever received from Audi UK.Contacted dealer two weeks ago warning that I would cancel my order if no assurances were forthcoming about new vehicle. He was unable to guarantee anything and has obviously been put in a very difficult position by Audi UK.Not long after it became apparent that VW, through their website had apologised to their loyal customers and were offering loyalty bonuses to potential purchasers of up to £1500.Rang dealer again last Tuesday to be told no such offerings would be forthcoming from Audi UK and he agreed that the way AUK were dealing with their customers left a great deal to be desired.At this point I cancelled the order and he admitted I was not the first and won't be the last. There were no quibbles regarding the refund of the deposit.Wednesday I placed an order for a Mercedes GLC.This weekend I advertised my current Q5 and sold it privately last night.This morning I received a call from the Audi dealer telling me that Audi UK were now offering a £2000 loyalty bonus if I went ahead with the purchase. Told him it was a bit late and that I was even more pissed off with AUK now!I then rang him back with a view to going ahead with the order to be told that it was dependant on me Part Xing my current Q5 which of course I could no longer do.So here's the sum total of my feelings.Been a loyal VAG customer for 26 years and had a new Q5 on order. It is then established that the largest motor company in the world has systematically been deceiving every man and his dog about the technical and performance details of their vehicles. A great deal of planning went into this deception at probably the highest levels. What the f***wits didn't plan for of course was being caught.Each arm of VAG it seems is then left to independently explain to its customers what they have done and what they intend to do about it. Is it unreasonable to expect a level of service commensurate with Audis standing in the pecking order?Well, what you actually get, is a pro forma letter telling you they have f****d around with your car without your knowledge but they are going to fix it with as little inconvenience as possible, and don't worry because they don't expect you to pay for the fix. Don't know what the effects will be on your vehicles but tough s**t. It is this contempt for its customers and their typically high horse approach that has me pissed off.Apology for being lying cheating corporate organised criminals? Reassurance about the value of your second most expensive asset? Compensation for putting you in the position they have done? Thanks for standing by us at this difficult time and being such a loyal customer?&#8230;&#8230; No, not even a kiss my arse. They then have the temerity to warn me that if I sell the vehicle I must inform DVLA, like it has anything to do with them!For me this is about a point of principle, I'm not an eco warrior but I will try to do my bit where possible. I even put up with that stupid stop start function in the misguided belief that i'm playing my part. If only I knew that I was belching out more shit than a Chinese power station. The fact is another large corporation thinks they can do what they want, when they want, with impunity and with no regard for the consequences of their actions and the effects on its customers. So we can now add VAG to the long list of corporate thieving scumbags.I'm only one person, but I take solace that firstly I've done my bit and voted with my feet. Audi have lost a loyal customer to one of their rivals and secondly I believe someone will ultimately have to answer for their actions. I sit here imagining Martin Winterkorn sharing a prison cell with Sepp Blatter and it gives me a lovely warm feeling.Click to expand...Hi pg220 who was the dealer offering the £2000 as I have a new one on order thanks","November 24, 2015"
davyk31,"Tying the loyalty bonus to having to trade a car in is again sharp practice. They therefore plan to shaft you over the trade in value and then say they have given an extra 2000. The VW bonus does not rely on a trade in, all you have to prove is that you owned a VW vehicle for a certain length of time. Much fairer treatment and it certainly seems VW are more open and apologetic, Audi are playing the high horse prestige manufacturer but they forget they are lying cheats. My first Audi and if it is effected and looses value they will struggle to retain my custom.","November 24, 2015"

Some people seem to think it will be hard to prove that this scandal will affect the values of VAG vehicles going forwards but I think there is going to be a clear decline in them vs. other premium German brands and owners are going to demand and be given compensation (voluntarily by VAG or mandated by government),"November 26, 2015"
Jules,"Pg220 said:JulesWhen did you receive that letter. Mine arrived yesterday over a month after I asked the question.Here's the full versionFrom&#8230; Audi UK Customer ServicesSubject: AU-2015/11-000461Dear Mr GThank you for your email dated 28 October to Audi UK.I would like to assure you that the Volkswagen Group is working hard to develop technical solutions for the affected dieselvehicles to correct any issues with the emissions characteristics of NOx, in relation to the testing regime of the vehicles andis working with the relevant authorities in this regard. Once approved, we will provide you with more details regarding how andwhen the technical solutions will be implemented.At the moment, the technical details of the fix and the timescales for implementing the fix have been provided to the relevantauthorities and are awaiting their approval. We have agreed a timetable with the relevant authorities that the solution willstart to be implemented from early 2016. We are in close liaison with the Department of Transport. The provisional timetablecommunicated to the KBA and shown to the VCA is as follows:Engine Approval Intended Start of Fix roll outEA189 2 litre Jan/Feb 2016 Week 9 2016EA189 1.2 litre April/May 2016 Week 22 2016EA189 1.6 litre July/Aug/Sept 2016 Week 39 2016The above timeline is subject to finalisation of the technical solutions and approval by the relevant authorities (KBA, VCA andMDI).In more detail, Volkswagen Group is developing a software solution for the 1.2 and 2.0 litre EA189 engines. For the 1.6 litreEA189 engine, the company will provide not only a software update but also a technical solution for the exchange of hardwarecomponents within the engine. These proposed technical solutions will be subjected to an in-depth qualitative analysis andapproval by the relevant authorities (KBA, VCA and the MDI). This will be undertaken with as little inconvenience to thecustomer as possible.In the meantime I can confirm that the NOx emissions testing issue does not change the fact that your car remains technicallysafe and roadworthy. It has been approved by an independent approval authority, which means it is legally allowed to be drivenon the roads.The NOx emissions testing issue relates only to NOx emissions levels in testing. There is also no evidence that the NOxemissions testing issue impacts the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions levels, fuel consumption or any other specification of theaffected vehicles in real world driving.In relation to the re-sale value of your car several factors will affect the value of your car, including its condition, thetime of year you are looking to sell and dealerships' independent stock profile. However, affected used cars are still beingsold. Further, there has been no change to Audi's trade-in policy as a result of this issue, and so, should you wish to, youwill be able to trade-in your car at a Audi dealership without issue.The Volkswagen Group are continuing to monitor resales of affected vehicles. Industry experience has shown that even when therehas been a safety recall (which this issue is not), there is no identifiable impact on resale values.With regards to your new vehicle, we would recommend that you contact the Audi centre where the vehicle is on order, so they canadvise if your vehicle is one of those affected.I am sorry you have had reason to contact us and appreciate your patience during this time.Yours sincerelyTara WilliamsonCustomer Relations AdvisorAudi UKT 0800 699 888ECustomer.Services@audi.co.ukClick to expand...Hi Pg220,I received my letter on 20/11/2015 this was the reassurance I was looking for, now I have it in writing from Audi UK any issues regarding emissions going forward the vehicle will be returned for a full refund.I received my letter on 20/11/2015 this was the reassurance I was looking for, now I have it in writing from Audi UK any issues regarding emissions going forward the vehicle will be returned for a full refund.","November 26, 2015"

missile,"SteveMak said:Itwasn't""...our government 'experts'..."" who told us that VAG's diesel are environmental saviors, or that they get great fuel economy. Government agencies just [a] defined legal emission levels,defined the testing methodology to ascertain if a vehicle violates those laws (i.e., unrealistic in-lab test only), and [c] defined the methodology to determine fuel economy. It wasVAGwho figured out how to game the system to get great in-lab emissions numbers while doing badly in real-world conditions, and how to game fuel economy numbers (e.g., overinflating tires, adding diesel to motor oil to thin it out for tests, etc.). VAG came up with those numbers, and reported them to government agencies. Government agencies just passed those numbers onto consumers, without validating them. Consumer entities and organisations, such as car reviewers and product analysts (e.g., America's Consumer Reports) just repeated those emission numbers to the public (some performed their own real-world fuel economy tests). And of course, VAG marketing also reiterated their falsified emissions and fuel economy numbers to consumers.In my view, governments around the world were caught with their pants down by thinking that an in-lab test reflects real-world conditions for emissions. They were also naive to think that the auto industry's self-policing is effective for monitoring and compliance, especially when it's so easy to see the huge incentives they have to misrepresent (Hint... profit).BTW, my point in the post that you quoted is that some misguided public perception first saw VAG diesels as saviors, and now again some misguided public perception sees all diesels as ""...equivalent of Victorian chimney stacks..."".

A18kny,I dont think i got impacted atall with rescent news. I got what i wanted,"December 18, 2015"
davyk31,I got an email this week from my Audi dealer offering A3 1.6 Tdi Cabrios. Small discount but the interesting thing is the GFV after 4 years which was 53% of RRP.That doesn't sound like a company expecting their residuals to go into free fall especially as this was for a diesel car. Yes it may end up worth less in which case the owner hands it back and walks away but audi aren't going to expose themselves to getting a load of cars back that aren't worth anywhere near the GFV.Goods news I reckoned and keeping the GFV helps keep the monthly payments lower on PCP.,"December 19, 2015"
missile,"I am very surprised at 53% GFV after four years! That is more than I would have expected before the current ..... ""issue"". Only issue for me would be the interest charges on that deal(?)I am also considering an A3 Cabriolet for my wife. Perhaps a 2.0TDI / 1.8 TFSI?","December 19, 2015"
davyk31,APR is 6.8% so it's normal enough. Deposit is 1500 then payments are 299 per month on a 4 year 10k per year. S Line A3 cab rio as well. Seemed pretty decent to me and as you say a very high GFV.,"December 19, 2015"
missile,"I meant the total interest charges to borrow over 4 years, that will be high.","December 19, 2015"
davyk31,That's the price to pay for buying a new car on PCP!,"December 19, 2015"
missile,"I would agree that is the price one pays for the deal. The beauty of PCP is one can tailor the package to suit your personal circumstances. You pay much less interest with max deposit, a shorter term and lower final payment.","December 20, 2015"
Snow Man,"Depends, it doesn't mean one thing or the other - you can get Tiguans for £99/month (internal fleet emailed this one last week), it's more than likely a block deal to clear excess stock or keep the line running at cost.. BMW build cars just to have run around for a few weeks to become used cars.","December 20, 2015"
davyk31,The Tiguan deal will be mostly to do with the new model being just round the corner. Deals on these are pretty readily available.Agree that interest cost can be lessened with a larger deposit but can't see why you would want to reduce the GFV. This would increase the monthly payment and increase your risk should the cars value be less than predicted.,"December 20, 2015"
missile,We all have different requirements.,"December 20, 2015"
davyk31,"Yes normally that's the case but just say you bought a VW or Audi 6 months ago and then all of a sudden they were found to be cheats and demand for the brand fell considerably and potentially thus your value after 4 years is a lot less than expected. In that situation you may be very glad of a higher GFV.All hypothetical of course, can't see something like that ever happening lol.And yes you pay more interest but you repay less capital which will be greater than the interest. I'd rather take the sure bet in that situation.","December 21, 2015"
davyk31,How does it gain more interest for the finance company anyway??The loan size doesn't change does it. If the car is 30k with a 3k deposit. loan is always 27k no matter what the final value is. The higher GFV lessens the capital repayment and hence the monthly sum. All a lower GFV does is increase the monthly payment and increases the chance of positive equity at the end but you have paid for that each month.Am I missing something?,"December 21, 2015"
missile,You don't seem to understand how interest is calculated on PCP. This is off topic and I suggest you read previous posts on PCP.,"December 21, 2015"
davyk31,"I was of course referring to existing deals because as you say dealers are already factoring in the effects of higher discounting and lower residuals for new deals. Interestingly VW GFVs all took a downgrade around March this year, long before the public knew anything about the emissions scandal but perhaps around the time the story was breaking to VW in the US.","December 22, 2015"
davyk31,But also as posted above Audi are willing to pump a deal on A3 at 52% GFV at year 4. That doesn't show a loss of confidence although sales will be relatively low so if a few cars come back in negative equity it isn't going to kill them.,"December 22, 2015"
Snow Man,"It doesn't show ANYTHING, other than they want to push sales...In the same way i gave the VW example previously (which is clearly a loss leader even at the height of the models sales curve), first it sends a msg of confidence to consumers but it's also about clearing existing stock and trying to stop the decline in sales numbers. It's better to make a small loss than have airfields full of unsold cars.","December 22, 2015"

He said no problem using my own oil, and the bill would decrease by approx £100 for the 7 litres of oil (the call centre inc-oil-quote was £267.88)However, when he'd taken all the details, he told me that I don't need a service at all.

To differentiate between the 2 issues for a given year the earlier issues (March) are identified by the year e.g. XX16 XXX and the latter issue for cars registered between 1st September 2016 and Feb 28 2017 are the year plus 50.

Daytona Q,Anything on the DVLA list is a minimum £399 with a 66 configuration. So they are effectively forcing you to pay more to allow you to keep the 66 identity.

Phil SQ5,The pins without any brass in are 10 and 12.12 I think isn't used for anything as the car recognises when somethings attached so this doesn't need to be used. 10 is the switched live I believe so not sure whether I need this as well as the permanent t live in pin 9. Pin 13 is another earth from what I can gather.I double checked and it is definitely pin 10 and 12 which don't have any brass in. Looks like I'll be phoning Audi then to get this switched live installed.Sorry I'm not that clued up on caravans and what pins I need to have!

Worth shopping around the dealers as their rates vary widely for the same work.

Once back in the UK, the middle lane muppets reappeared...Return journey yesterday was 810 miles - left at 6am local time and was back in Warwickshire at 5.30pm - 12.5 hours door to door including Tunnel crossing - do the figures yourself - yep, we'll just call it ""rapid progress"".Mostly drive the car in Dynamic mode (still can't resist the sound) but switched to Efficiency mode on the autoroutes and saw marked improvement in fuel economy - circa 42mpg average for the entire journey.First time I've properly used the ACC, Side / Lane assist features: ACC is fantastic - took a while to get used to (car decelerates when approaching a car in front unless you indicate / change lanes in time) but, it made the journey so much more effortless. However, it's a pretty hopeless feature for using on UK roads - heavy traffic / congestion means that maintaining a constant speed is nigh on impossible.Niggles:Only one - screen wash tank capacity is too small. Constant traffic spray meant frequent use was needed and combination of screen cleaning, driving light washing and rear window cleaning emptied the tank quickly. Have resorted to keeping a top-up bottle in the boot.Overall conclusion:I just LOVE this car.

However still bad congestion into Austria at 1100. It seems that half of Holland is on the road - they must drive overnight Friday to be there that early!We then all drive back SaturdayMy cunning plan for next year is to meet the family at Munich airport on the Friday night (cheap late flights at 2000), all stay in an airport hotel and then leave early to beat the rush.Coming back we will depart Friday after skiing, overnight around Karlsruhe and be at Eurotunnel just after midday.As you point out and we found out, UK Border Control simply cannot cope with the flow later in the afternoon and it backs up. I've just sent a complaint e-mail as it was exactly the same last year. Since they moved the border control to just after check-in a few years ago (and tightened the checks), it has been terrible every half-term.I'll have to order an SQ5 in the next few months if I want to use it for this run nxt year!Click to expand...Driving seems to be the prudent way to do things - flights at half term for four of us would have been £1300 (Easyjet Birmingham to Geneva rtn) + car hire another £600 = £1900.Taking the car was £150 with Eurotunnel, spent about £170 on fuel, £120 on tolls and £75 for the overnight stay at Calais (Holiday Inn Coquelles) = £515.The difference worked out to be nearly £1400.Teenage kids + skiing holiday (4 x 7 day lift passes = £750) = expensive trip.Ouch.","February 25, 2014"

There is however a small annual charge; here's the link:https://www.saneftolling.co.uk/support/faq/support-Faq.List/#1.0.The convenience of toll queue avoidance, searching for coins or cards (and paying from the front passenger window) far outweighs the minimal admin fee IMO.","May 4, 2016"
jonnyspin,"It's about 5 euros a year iirc - I just leave it running even if I don't plan to go to France this year.When you're there, it can make a big difference in journey time just avoiding the queues (you can tag at 30kph)","May 4, 2016"

Turbulence,"Sj1000 said:Audi are pretty vague on this, both in the brochure and when actually buying the car.My MMI was set to 10,000 miles or 1year, (through no choice of mine)When I took it in, the rather helpful service manager told me it was a waste of time and money doing this simple oil change now, then having to return @ 19,000 for the full service check.He said the original oil is more than good enough for 19,000miles, and it hadn't lost a drop, so rather than taking my money he just came out to the car and re-set the MMI to 19,000.I took it back a year later and they did the whole lot combined for £327.Mine isn't the SQ5 but I'm sure the same applies.Click to expand...So when you come to trade the car in and someone checks the service history it will be missing the first service ?","April 27, 2016"
MrH,"Nope - the 10k/1 year is a fixed term service whereas the 19k/2 year is a variable.

Turbulence,If the 10k one year service is fixed should it not have been done ? I only ask as my sq5 is soon to be one year old only done 4K miles and getting a lot of hassle from Audi to book my car in and it has to be done as the oil is only good for a year so they tell me,"April 27, 2016"

Sq5john,"Actually it's not ridiculous at all, you car is probably on the default variable service interval.If you have variable service intervals turned on then the car will figure out when you need a service depending on how you drive it and the duration of your journeys. Spend a lot of every week doing motorway stuff, engine at a near constant speed and hot and the service interval will stretch out to 18 or 19,000 miles. alternatively if you do predominately short journeys when the engine never really gets super hot then the oil will break down faster and you will need a service sooner.","April 29, 2016"

ribsta,"I wondered about fuel economy during winter. Last year I spoke to the local Audi dealer about mine reducing by 3 mpg and they said it shouldn't.

Steppy,I guess the auxiliary heater must have an effect on the economy...,"December 21, 2014"

Ransman,"I think this is probably the biggest contributory factor.5. Lower average engine temperatureIn the winter, an engine takes longer to reach operating temperature and cools off faster when shut off.

missile,I would suggest you speak with a broker like our sponsor Adrian Flux,"February 11, 2016"
x-Lanerboy,I have had several quotes today on a separate policy to insure just the SQ5 and I have 2 problems1 I can only use my no claims on 1 policy so I need to use it on my traders policy2 Other insurance companies will not take my no claims into account as I have been on a traders policy for the last 18 years and they will only take ncb into account if earned through a private policy not a company policy,"February 12, 2016"

Barbyboy,"+1For what it's worth:If you've been a named driver on a spouse's policy and have maintained a decent joint claim-free record, many insurers will provide a letter on request which is often (but not always) sufficient for that 'named' driver to then start his / her own new policy with NCB attached.Ironically, original steer on this came from Volkswagen Audi Group themselves, whilst reviewing the freebie 7 day insurance they provide with a new vehicle.","February 12, 2016"

x-Lanerboy,well finally got the result I was after Axa have agreed to insure my SQ5 plus WITHOUT a tracker woo hoo I was all ready to cancel my insurance in the end but they came good right at the bitter end so I went from cat 5 tracker to tracker locate to no tracker so a good result in my eyes,"February 22, 2016"

I then adhered the female socket for the jack plug to the underside of the glove compartment with double sided tape. This gives me the option to unplug it at will. Why would I need to unplug it?

jonnyspin,"I'm sure that chains are not essential in Germany. I've been going for years in winter in my own car and airport rentals. I have only used chains on 2 rental cars I had with summer tyres. Having said that, chains would most definitely be advisable if you knew that there was a chance of a big dump whilst you are there.BTW, I was having a quick recce at the Channel Tunnel carpark in Folkestone whilst waiting for my train and was surprised how few cars had winter tyres, including the ones that looked like they might be heading for the mountains (long thin roof boxes etc - of course this may mean nothing)","March 1, 2016"

neebsta,"MrZapie said:AustriaWinter tyres are mandatory in Austria. The law states that passenger cars with a permissible maximum weight of up to 3.5 tonnes may be operated only between 1 November and 15 April in winter conditions such as snow, slush or ice if winter tyres have been installed on all wheels. All-season tyres are also considered winter tyres if they have the ""M + S"" mark.As an alternative to winter tyres, snow chains may be used on at least two driving wheels, however, these may only be used in case the road is covered by a complete or scarcely broken snow cover or sheet of ice. Failure to comply with the law results in a fine up to 5,000 Euros and the vehicle could be impounded. Insurance is deemed void if a vehicle which is involved in an accident between November 1 and April 15 is not fitted with winter tyres.Click to expand...I'm pretty sure 'Winter Tyres' and 'Mandatory' between '1/11 and 15/4' means exactly that. They are mandatory during that period. Last part - insurance is deemed invalid for any vehicle involved in an accident between 1/11 and the 15/4 that is not fitted with winter tyres.It's not, in my opinion suggesting summer tyres and chains can be used in lieu of winter tyres, far from it in fact.","March 9, 2016"

secretwookie,"My 2013 Q5 sline 2.0 stronic is just coming up to the end of its manufacturer warranty period and I'd appreciate views on whether it's worth buying another 12 months from Audi.Cheapest named parts cover with £250 excess is just over £300 for 15k miles. Full cover around the £500 mark. Considering the cheapest option just to cover if anything major goes wrong.I've owned the car from new, no major issues, 34k on the clock. Fully serviced by the dealer each year.Our ideal would be to keep the car for a few more years with it transitioning to a second car in 12-18 months time.Views?","February 25, 2016"

Would have to be a trusting deal with someone. I have done this before, successfully.","February 17, 2016"

davyk31,"Absolutely no reason why you can't take their finance and then pay it off. I think if its too quickly paid off the dealer may loose out so it depends on how you feel about. Alternatively wait 3 or 4 months and then pay it off, no one looses and you still get the deposit contribution. You would be mad to miss out on the £1500 and 3 months on the PCP won't cost that much in interest.","January 14, 2016"

SteveMak,"Hello from CanadaWinter tires use rubber that's formulated to be grippier in snow, sleet, slush and even just plain cold. As you approach freezing temps, 38'F can result in glare ice. Also, summer tires harden as they get colder, and don't provide as good traction in cold weather as do snow tires, and obviously much less traction in snow, sleet, and slush. All season tires, though better in winter than summer tires, aren't nearly as good as real winter tires.","January 12, 2016"

The black mirrors, roof spoiler and top of the door handles stand out well on the shots of the Glacier White model, not too well on the Sepang and of course non existent on my choice of Panther Black.I am also glad I went for the gloss black alloys, the titanium finish somehow does not look quite right.It is interesting to note that the German spec does not have the black mirrors, roof spoiler and door handles as standard or the diamond pattern seats. Lots of Daytona's on the site as well so maybe a standard colour over there.Thanks for finding.Click to expand...No problem, the black does look very nice, but actually all the colours look pretty good IMO.You're right about the spec, I had a play about on the german configurator (trying in vain to save a few bob), daytona is available to them and they also have a much wider range of wheels, including black RS4 style, 2 options I would probably have gone for if available over here.Looks like they get the red callipers for free as well, every one seems to have them.Knew my higher german would come in handy eventually","January 2, 2016"

Just tried again using reg of old Q5 and WBAC quote £25,000 that's around £2,000 less in just 3 months. So using that calculation it would drop another £2,000 in the next 3 months by then it would have been 3 years old and worth £22,000 thats around 45% depreciation or 55% retained value.

purephase,They'll try it on but if you walk they will call you back if they want the car - I took an M3 into them years ago and they tried to knock off all sorts so I just told them I'd go elsewhere as I had other offers at the price they had advertised (sort of true) - they ended up paying me £500 premium!,"November 27, 2015"

That said I plan on keeping this car for at least 3-4 years so long term depreciation isn't my main concern.

anty1985,Hello allI am looking to purchase an SQ5 after selling my much loved audi TTS.The big question I have though is what kind of discount could I expect to achieve on something like the car below?http://www.ebay.co.u...88AAOSwT5tWOrhaAny help would be gratefully appreciatedRegardsRichard,"November 15, 2015"
Chaznik,I would be expecting to pay £42/43k,"November 11, 2015"
GRANDDUC,"Apart from the fact they are asking way too much £ its has 20'' standard issue wheels which are very nice but when you are paying this sort of money you really really want the 21's!! You can probably spec up a brand new one with 21's and similar spec and get around 12% discount which will take you down to around £45,000 which will probably be the better deal but I'm guessing you are eager to get behind the wheel of an SQ5. Tread carefully......","November 11, 2015"
davyk31,As above I would think you could perhaps spec new for cheaper but that may mean waiting until March. These pre-reg deals are always aimed at either the person who doesn't know what deals can be got on a new car or alternatively those who want a car asap.,"November 11, 2015"

GRANDDUC,Might be a good exercise to get Audi to confirm in writing whether any new/existing SQ5 they are selling is affected by the emission scandal and if they will not commit then neither should you but if they do get it in writing and if it turns out that your car is affected contract it in that you get your mon£y back..

j1sgo,"I got 12% for a plus (including 1k contribution) and choose to wait 3 months to have brand new.This favours even more for the standard sq5, you could probably get a decent spec new one for under 45k which is less than a lot of 5k mile second hand ones.","November 12, 2015"
lichfield6,"How much discount? Well all the above under normal circumstances, and remember there's a new model Q5 later next year too (but not yet for SQ5).

That has started to hit sales and who in their right mind would buy a new Audi at this moment in time without a massive discount (20%+)?","November 12, 2015"
davyk31,If you are buying a used SQ5 I would be looking at say 40k for a 2014 car and maybe 42-43k for a 2015. More than that and it only really makes sense to buy a new car.As above the emissions scandal means the should be happy to see any customer through the door so I would exploit that. And the suggestion above about getting them to confirm in writing that any car you buy is not affected by NOx or CO2 scandals is excellent.

Is this true?High vis jacketTriangle - one in car alreadyHeadlight adjustment - this used to be a sticker. Can you adjust the HL in the MMI? Or do I need to buy a whole lamp?Winter tires - I've got the tires that came with the Q5. I think all seasons. Are these legal? I'm headed for the Mountains on excursions from Munich. Last Christmas there was heavy snow.Anything else?Many thanks!James,"November 12, 2015"
SQ-Raphster,It's a legal requirement to have a breathalyser in your car in France (minimum of 2).You can adjust lights via MMI setting.,"October 29, 2015"

GRANDDUC,Drive in France all the time during the summer months. Motorways are great but expensive and the French drivers assume that if they are paying to use a road then the 130/110km speed restriction does not apply to them so they drive as fast as they want. My guess is that the police don't often bother patrolling the autoroutes just the route nationales which often have traps set up to spoil your day!!

SwingKing,"How much deposit did you stick in originally? Sounds a bit steep to me, unless your new car is of much greater value than the previous one, in which case you'd expect a little more input needed.","October 31, 2015"
Dermu,Yes it's very steep. Most dealers have a loyalty scheme designed to retain their pcp customers. Firstly you'd have equity in your car secondly the difference to keep your payments the same is usually given in the form of a loyalty dealer contribution. This helps pcp customers get into new cars long as it's of the same class. Obviously if you go for a higher spec model then you'd need to top up your deposit to get your payments to where they need to be.Sounds like your dealer isn't offering you a good deal.,"October 31, 2015"

rifleman,"Dermu said:Firstly I shop around near the 18months mark. I also call up audi finance to get a settlement figure so thst i know what I'm working with. I look on audi's used car locator to see what similar spec, age and mileage is going for. I get a valuation from cap. Do all the homework myself which only takes about 30 minutes. (Gfv - cap valuation = equity) but audi normally chuck in on top lots of loyalty bonuses. When I talk to dealers they know I've done my homework and they can't pull the wool on me. I keep everything email or via carwow.Lastly I use car wow to get pcp quotes from several dealers. I contact the one who is offering the lowest payments and then tell them that I have a trade in.I tell the dealer that if they can lower my payments I'm happy to go with them. The way I see it is that they have targets to meet tgdy need my business and they not having my hard earned dosh unless they work for it by making the deal in my favour. I also have ford RS moved from an ST deposit free and lowered my payments by 30 quid. You can make it happen. Don't show desperation and be blunt and tell them this is what I want go make it happen go speak to your boss. You don't ask you don't get.Click to expand...Great advice thanks Demru. I've already done most of the above and when I mentioned doing a straight swap both my original dealer 40 miles away and my local dealer just laughed and said this just does not happen. Perhaps my monthly payments are too low - after paying nearly £11K Deposit I pay £345 per month?I had a dream of being able to upgrade my car for less of a deposit - but that seems to have gone out the window.","November 1, 2015"
Dermu,On a 11k deposit you are paying a reasonable monthlyrental.ifboth your dealers laughed saying that this doesn't happen then maybe you need to contact different dealers. As I mentioned carwow is faultless. The dealers contact you you don't do anything but submit an initial enquiry. When I upgraded my st for RS I bought from a dealer that was 490 miles away from me. They did a free mationwide delivery. There are dealers out there that will bend over backwards to put together a deal just not maybe the ones you been dealing with.,"November 2, 2015"
A18kny,"I agree with you there, where i live up north east of scotland, which most know a big majority work in oil or are related somehow, so RS models and expensive models go out at aberdeen daily, so by travelling to dundee say the difference in the dealer is huge.

rifleman,"purephase said:Hi Rifleman. I think this is similar to your question on the GFV you had a while back.I think Dermu is bang on - you need to arm yourself with the key financial facts before you talk to your dealer, and know exactly what these mean in terms of whether what they offer you meets your financial goals or not.My experience is that dealers will try and talk to you in terms of deposits and monthly payments - concealing things like the actual ticket price they are charging for the car (i.e. the discount), the balloon payment and ultimately the interest rate unless you specifically ask. Sure they will be on the document you sign but by that stage the deal is done.Regarding your actual trade in position - I don't think it's possible to judge whether it's good or bad without all the details - it does strike me that you've put decent miles on the car for something around 2 years old - and that's obviously going to count against you.Click to expand...cheers purephase,i listed the figures previously on here elsewhere - i'll find them again and put them up to see and you can have a better picture.14K miles per year isn't excessive at all - is it?","November 2, 2015"
Dermu,I always set my mileage limit at 6000 even though I do around 11000. Long as you not handing the car back to the finance company then the dealer doesn't care how many miles youcover.longas you keeping business on the books with them. As with the Q5 the demand is there even with the scandal it's still a very desirable car. The used car market is very good for all the Q's with top trim levels not the crappy se's,"November 2, 2015"

purephase,"Hi rifleman...I think you said that you had a balloon payment of £21,800 in a previous post - if I assume a fairly standard IR of 6.3% from Audi Finance that means your dealer is giving you a little over £4k in equity for your trade-in.

Pano-roof often creaks when closed so i often drive with it ajar (took me a year to realise if you pull (don't twist) the knob backwards it opens the roof slightly at a slant like a conventional sunroof).#3. Information displayed by the DAB is terrible / absent compared to many other cars i have driven.#4. The tiny 'cargo-net' in the passenger footwell descintegrated when one of my boys rested his foot on the torch it was holding at the time and i have no idea how to fix it.#5. The flat part on top of the rear bumper is just asking to be scratched and every Q5 i have seen has etches in the paintwork there.#6. The heated seats (front and rear) heat up fairly fast - yet slower than any other car i have driven.#7. The independant temperature controls can be 'pushed' - but i don't know why? i thought that you would turn them for temperature, and push and turn them for fan speed but instead - i have to first press the 'fan' button and then turn them individually to the desired speed - surely a 'push and turn' would be a more direct and sensible approach to conrolling the fan speed?#8. The heated mirrors do not heat with the rear windscreen unless i have the selector set to the 'heat mirrors' setting - catches me out sometimes and i don't mind heating my mirrors if i'm demisting the rear windcreeen wether they need heating or not.#9. When i unlock the car - the folding door mirrors do not unfold and therefore the puddle lights fail to illuminate the ground as i step into the car meaning if there is a puddle and it's dark - i certainly won't see the puddle until i: a) stand in it, orget into the Q5, start my engine, wait for the door mirrors to unfold, then get out, step into the puddle again and close the door so it illuminates the puddle i have stepped into twice already - can you tell this really bugs me? again - other much cheaper cars can light up the ground before i get in - why can't my Q5!?other than that i LOVE my Q5Click to expand...I've found the same on #9 - I didn't even know that I had puddle lights until my son accidentally turned off the auto folding mirrors while he was messing around in the front! I wouldn't actually spec folding mirrors again on a Q5 - they are so deep that the folded vs. unfolded width isn't that great - and I don't park my cars in a narrow garage. There was a much bigger difference on my previous S5 Cabriolet.Re #3 - it is possible to find more info on the DAB like track info and commentary - but it's hidden in another menu so I've rarely bothered - as you say most systems have an auto scroll of the available data.","October 8, 2015"

SteveMak,"I found the Q5's ""folding wing mirrors"" implementation to be wanting. They don't actually fold. They rotate upwards, reducing the car's width only slightly (the main reason for folding mirrors is to protect them from careless passers by), and the upward tilt means they become a platform for falling accumulating dirt, rain water, snow, and other debris.

rifleman,"well, i asked my dealer to try explain and he said i am neither better or worse off - as it just means the values of the Q5 i will be buying into are predicted to be higher than the one i bought into 2 years ago (is this a good sign for Q5 residuals?).so i'm still none the wiser but the figures (i.e. deposit and monthly payments) are all looking good and make sense, i guess i am just trying to make sure i am not in for a nasty shock when the next time to upgrade comes around.","October 13, 2015"
davyk31,"Are the two cars different models? Kinda assume they have to be or the term is different as the values certainly aren't going to be increasing.If they are different models then its very hard to say if you are better or worse off. If they are the same model then you are worse off technically, this depends on you selling the car and thus in the second instance you have lower left over therefore less equity. If you return the car, which no one really does unless the values have tumbled below the GFV, then it doesn't make any odds.Tell us more and we can hopefully make sense of it.","October 14, 2015"

purephase,"Exactly Banners24B - my dealer tried this on me - up the balloon payment to reduce the monthly charge in order to match a competitor dealership (although for me that was all within a 3 year contract).A lot of people have no intention (or means) to pay off the balance at the end, so they are only focusing on the monthly cost. IMO those people should really looking at leasing their car with no right to buy at the end as they'll pay less that way.

purephase,"rifleman said:thanks again,i'll still be on a 36 month PCP of £345.2 yrs ago i paid £11K deposit on my current Q5 with a GFV / Balloon of £18,800.now the deal is just a £4800 deposit still on a new 36 month PCP of £345 with a GVF / Balloon of £21,800.at least i think the GFV / Ballon refer to the exact same figure?so the new GFV / Balloon is gone up by £3K but my deposit is gone down by £6K.Click to expand...Assuming the ticket price of the car is roughly the same, you are giving half the deposit so something has to give - and in this case it's the balloon payment. However the real ""cost"" is the interest rate.This calculator is quite helpfulhttp://www.pcpcal.co.uk/","October 14, 2015"
davyk31,No you haven't been stitched up if you can handle the monthly costs which are higher than they would have been with the lower miles. You will have a car that should be worth more at the end therefore more equity left after the finance is cleared. Only if you wanted to rely on the GFV have you done yourself harm. This could happen if residuals collapse and it's worth less than GFV so you just hand it back. In this case you have paid more monthly than you should have. Yes the instance where someone wants to rely on GFV is very rare but then the happenings of a major motor group being caught cheating and thus loosing brand image and possibly residual values is also rare but does happen!!!,"October 14, 2015"
rifleman,"I guess i need to be careful and make sure the dealer hasn't just added the cost of any discounts he has offered to the GFV, as this will eat into my equity.currently - he is saying I have £5500 equity on my car at its 2yr point with a 3yr GFV of £18,800.I just hope a new Q5 with a 3yr GFV of £21800 still has about £5500 equity in its second year, or this will leave me tight on on upgrade to a new new Q5 in 2017.great advice guys thank you, keep it coming, I'm learning a lot.","October 14, 2015"
purephase,@rifleman - you can check the rough value of your car on webuyanycar/parkers etc. You'll need to factor in the remaining payments on your 3 year plan but you can ask your dealer to explain exactly how he's arrived at that equity figure using the current market value of the vehicle - he should prepared to do that - if he isn't I'd take your business elsewhere!,"October 15, 2015"

GRANDDUC,"Had my SQ5 for around a month and occasionally when leaving the car smell a warm rubbery smell which seems to be coming from around the underneath somewhere in the middle.

Have covered around 1,300 miles so maybe something is still bedding in? Any ideas anyone?","October 8, 2015"

The Q5 would not have been mentioned in their list as the Audi USA does not sell the 2 litre diesel Q5 only the 3 litre version which does not seem to be affected at the moment.Has anyone contacted Audi to check if the Q5 with Adblue is affected?You have probably gathered that I have a 13MY that has Adblue so I am starting to get concerned particularly about resale values etc if it is affected.I will probably contact Audi myself but just thought I would check to see if any one has already done so.John,"September 24, 2015"

Same combo as me if so. On the basis of that link I will avoid the Michelin's, but I am really surprised at the criticism. We will have to wait 4 weeks for the Dunlop's and will probably fit another set of Pirelli's but I'm not convinced by the ride quality, though general grip seems fine. My RS is on Bridgestone's and though they really grip in corners the car tramlines under load to a point where it feels edgy, similar to previous rear wheel 911's I've owned, which is a concern. Be interested to know what you're running, everyone seems to hate Pirelli's on the RS, but I'm wondering if the snaking is more to do with chassis than tyres.","September 9, 2015"
Brooner,"Yes same combo the SQ5 is on Dunlop's which are not a bad tyre but only on about 12K and almost done I'm surprise too about the Michelin review too to might go with the conti's as there is not too many manufacturers doing the 21""for the SQ5 and I wouldn't fit the pirelli tyres on a bikeAs for the RS4 can't see past the Michelin PSS great tyre had them on my last RS4 but they both came with Pirelli P zeros crap tyre made the car tramlined on the white lines on my frits RS4 the B5 it was positivity dangerous on the Pirelli's the tramlineing was so violentBut the PSS are the best tyre for the RS imo","September 10, 2015"

GRANDDUC,Have specced B&O sound system in new car but curious as to what to expect. The standard system on S-Line 2.0 TDI has 10 speakers and 180w output but not sure what other bits and pieces it has dotted around the car. However it seems that 3.0 models may have additional equipment stored in spare wheel so assume the B&O system will have even more equipment -I know is has 14 speakers- but assume it will have sub-woofers and such like also in spare wheel. Appreciate some details from those in the 'know'.,"September 9, 2015"

GRANDDUC,SQ5.,"June 20, 2015"
SQ-cinco,"My SQ5 has the B & O system with the subwoofer in the spare wheel well. All I can say is that compared with other systems in previous Audi's the sound is fantastic. Don't forget to adjust the settings in the MMI for each of the functions, i.e. you can have different settings for radio, SD card, I-pod etc. Enjoy.","June 20, 2015"

Norbs,What sort of music is that colharris? We'll mostly have the radio on and when the children are in (most of the time) then it's quite quiet too. Not sure if it's worth adding it to my SQ5 order?,"June 21, 2015"
GRANDDUC,Have specced this for new SQ5. IMO if you are buying a top-of range car then its almost expected for this to have a good quality sound system. I hear that the standard is sufficient but it doesn't have Bang & Olufsen stamped all over it. Having said this I was able to get a healthy 10.5% discount on this option so works out to around £478. Just had to do it.,"June 21, 2015"
zen123,I was fortunate to be able to listen to both and would say the standard system is actually very good. The B&O is definitely more refined sounding but depending on the type of music played there's not really a lot in it. If you're going to mostly listen to radio then I would save the £560.,"June 21, 2015"
Sq5john,With the B&O you get the DSP - Digital Sound Processor which isn't part of the standard set up I think?The DSP enables you to choose the sound distribution profile Driver/Front/All - to my ancient and certainly less than perfect ears the driver orientated setting is fabulous.,"June 21, 2015"
SwingKing,"I've listened to both, and my friend has a standard Q5 sound system . As has been stated, the standard system is very good, the B&O however is much more rounded and handles all music genres extremely well. I wouldn't buy a £50k car and not put a £500 upgraded system in. That being said, other manufacturers have invested in better systems in their range topping models, and I think Audi should have offered something better.","June 22, 2015"

I then take her for a blast to air dry anything remaining. This was a pain on my A5 too so expected it, the roof rails were a new pain with water creeping out long after drying, hence the quick drive to dry it out helps.Also amazed at the amount of brake dust on the alloys, I obviously used to use down gearing in my manual A5 a lot more than I thought for slowing down.

cruicd,450 -470 miles but usually takes < 70 litres to brim and never got more than 71 litres in. Tank officially takes 75 litres so 500 should be achievable with a TFSI. Assuming a 2.0 TDI will do > 35mpg I would expect a safe range of 550 miles.,"October 20, 2014"
PommieSQ5,"On a trip from the Gold Coast to Sydney, which is about 520miles, I still had 1/4 of a tank left in my SQ5, equating to fuel consumption of 44mpg, and theoretical range of approx. just under 700miles.Best I have got is 46mpg from Canberra to Sydney (195miles)Current avg. over the 6k miles I have driven is 34mpg, compared to 28mpg for my previous A4 B8 2.0T Quattro.","October 20, 2014"

Dermu,Hi guys. I'm hoping for some feedback from Q5 owners. I have bought a new 14 plate Q5. 2.0 TDI 177PS. The official date claimes combined MPG 47.1. I'm aware that there's no way those official figures could be met under our imperfect environments. So I wanted to know:What MPG do your cars deliver?I only ever do town driving do what could I be looking at?And finally on a full tank of diesel how many miles would I be able to cover.I look forward to your responses.,"September 6, 2015"
cruicd,Well said,"October 21, 2014"
colharris,"Well, it's not total nonsense, there is a saving to be made in theory. I once saw figures for a large family salon doing 12,000 miles a year. Basically, the 3 or 4 stone of fuel weight you save will be about 1% of the weight of the car and will save you about £20 a year. But... You will also top up over 20 times more, sometimes making an extra trip, and wasting some of that £20. So, true up to a point, but certainly not worth the damn hassle!Reminds me of my father-in-law who drives a 10 mile round trip to save 2 or 3p a litre. Life's too short.","October 21, 2014"

But don't want to go crazy will just thoroughly wash and clean but then just want to coat in decent wax to give adequate protection. Would probably prefer wax that you can put on a wet car but no expert in using these products would appreciate some advice. Heard Meguiar's Black Wax Paste and Bilt Hamber Double Wax are pretty good?

Ransman,Interesting observation at the showroom today. They reckon that when new Audi models are introduced they tend to be basic models so you have to spend money speccing it up with options.

Can any long term Audi watchers confirm this?,"September 4, 2015"

GRANDDUC,I guess as a lot of owners keep cars for around 2-3 years so its no surprise that there are a lot for sale at the moment as the SQ5 is around 2 years old now. I ordered a new one for September delivery and got over 10% discount which helps with the unavoidable depreciation.

If you refine the search to include the essential Heated Seats/B&O & Sat Nav then there are just 43 cars available, much more realistic.I do think however with the more technology loaded 2015 Q7 coming on-line that its availability will accentuate the somewhat elderly Q5 platform and that won't help second-hand values for even properly spec'd vehicles let alone those cars with lowly option lists.","August 23, 2015"

GRANDDUC,"30k!! For a 2013 plate presumably? WOW got £27,000 for my 30 month old Q5!! But I think you need to take into account that if you want a prestige German performance car with similar performance/size to the SQ5 you will need to spend more money in the first place so overall depreciation on the SQ5 will still be better than what you get on a more expensive car. So overall you will not be out of pocket. Technically speaking that is. Furthermore the new Q7 which really isn't a good comparison starts at £50,000 and is slower than the current SQ5!!","August 24, 2015"

My 3.0 V6 TDI Allroad (80 litre tank) would often show a range of 850-900 miles just after filling up but rarely had the bravery to exceed 600 miles in reality when it would take pretty close to the full 80 litres. 2.7TDI before it similar but not quite so optimistic. 2.0 TFSI will indicate 475-485 after fill up and remain there for up to 80 miles implying a range of 550+ but usually chicken out and stop to fill up after around 480 miles when the range is 0 and put in 70 - 72 litres.,"June 14, 2015"
IanSQFIVE,"I usually get 600 miles per tank, most I have ever managed is 620. I usually see 725 on the DIS but there is no way that is possible, I think 650 would be a push and probably not achievable.","June 15, 2015"

There also is noting inside the long narrow compartment in the rear liftgate.

VBR worth a try too.Storage is so inexpensive now that I don't think you have to compromise as much. I rip everything to lossless or download at 320 kbps (from Play generally), then you have the option of doing what you will with it. There's no going back once you compress a track and I use the higher quality tracks when streaming through my domestic gear, which is a lot less forgiving than an ipod ever will be, and I believe that to a certain extent the same is true of the B&O. Horses for courses!I started out using my ipod Touch in the car but for my money the B&O is far more capable than the ipod - and I would expect that it would be.

I have noticed audi sells some for A6 (not sure if avant or saloon)and A3 also noticed VW sells a roll up/down screen for some of its models. If anyone has inside information that the Q5 rear window is the same as a VW/Skoda/seat XX model I could investigate those avenues.

Audi's 3-piece set comes in at around £150. I can't find the tail-gate blind on it's own though, which is what I was thinking of. These are interior clip-in full window meshes.

To start with it was advertised at £135 (already a £15 saving) so I bid £100. They came back with £120 incl post, which I accepted. They arrived today (a day later). Don't get me wrong, these items are not worth more than £50 if I'm honest, but I really wanted that rear bind! So I have mesh blinds that just slot into place. I have covered the small rear load bay windows and that all important rear window. I already have tinted windows, and it just looks like the rear windows are a little more tinted. The advantage is that at anytime I can just spring them out.

Snow Man,"I think you may have a mistake in your math.lease or PCP, your monthly will be around the same.. interest on the deposit over 3 years is less than £300If you bought the car for 45k, the amount of interest lost if you work it out the simple way is around £2700, if you work it our based on paying back yourself @ 1250/month (or 1/36th) then the lost compound interest is only £900 after three years. You then need to defer the amount of interest you will pay on the loan for the PCP - Audi are around 7%","May 10, 2015"
GRANDDUC,You can probably tell I am new to leasing as never used before and as this is a pretty big purchase was just toying with the idea. In terms of cost its certainly attractive just paying a monthly fee and at the end of 3 years giving them back the car keys but is it really that attractive?

I know comparing the Q5 and SQ5 is pointless but I do like the Q5 and assume the new one will be better even in 2.0 TDI guise but maybe, just maybe I will still go for the SQ5 albeit to be replaced sometime in 2017 as my heart may get the last word!!Cheers","May 13, 2015"

GRANDDUC,I guess my point is how late would be sensible to order a current model SQ5 as with a new one on the horizon shortly expected depreciation has to be considered. Its probably a good thing to have Audi confirm the new model and then dealers cannot avoid giving bigger discounts should buyers wish to order the current model.,"May 8, 2015"
....,"Sq5john said:Sensibly speaking if depreciation is a concern that significantly affects your purchase decision do not buy a new car and especially one that is in it's last model year. Used values for SQs are falling and there is little doubt that the announcement of a new model will suppress them still further. You will probably lose around £10k in the 1st year, dealers discounting the vehicles just drives the residual values still lower.If it's an issue look for an 18 month old SQ, stick a private plate on it and be happy - new cars are only 'new' for a day in practical terms.Audi tend to launch cars with the most popular engines first, so take the new Q7, that just has one engine choice, and they have said there will one or two more by the end of the year. With the eco clouds on the horizon over diesel pollution I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the current SQ was the last of it's kind, sadly.Click to expand...So its a SQ7 Then?","May 9, 2015"
GRANDDUC,Yep agree with all said but still fancy a NEW SQ5 as used values are not that attractive at the moment!! I currently run a March/13 Q5 S-Line 2.0 TDI so unsure whether to wait and order SQ5 to coincide with its 3rd birthday so that will make it a March/2016 plate or get rid now and order for 65 plate. As for depreciation your 10k first year drop is certainly not reflected in the used cars being advertised but I am open to any comments from people who have sold/bought used SQ5's to change my mind.Cheers all.,"May 9, 2015"
Sj1000,"No, the car dealers are not selling them for 10k less, (or trying not too), but you trade in a 1 yr old SQ5, or attempt to sell it privately, and it will be heading rapidly toward that £10k loss","May 9, 2015"

mick1364,I've recently got 2 x 32GB SD cards for the MMI3G system and a 32GB USB storage device for the AMI connection in the glove box. I split all my music between this storage leaving some room on each for additions. The problem is I noticed on some of the albums that the track listings do not follow what they should be (specially irritating on live albums) I thought I had just mixed them up when doing the transfer but I've had them out and back to the computer to look at the file listings and they are all listed as per # number so should play as such in the car.Anyone got any Idea's as to what has happened to ix these up once they are connected in the car?thanks,"April 27, 2015"
colharris,I found when transferring to the SD card - particularly when having a large playlist of many tracks from various albums/artists - I had to export from iTunes to the play list in a format with correct structure including track number and including a .m3u file to control how it plays. You might find it easier to find software that does all this for you - there are loads out there for Windows or Mac. Otherwise Google the problem and you will see how people have manually done it including editing m3u files.,"April 23, 2015"
colharris,Just want to point out - when I say track number for a large various artist playlist I mean inserting a unique index in the order I want the songs to play at the start of the title. Playlist Export on the Mac does this and I think MediaMonkey on Windows may handle it too.,"April 23, 2015"
Sporta,when i copied the files from itunes they had track numbers etc so i deleted them and now appear in alphabetical order.,"April 23, 2015"
mick1364,"If you're listening to a live album where the tracks run into each other, they have to play in the correct order or it doesn't sound right. That's the problem I'm having.","April 23, 2015"
mirekmal,"I believe MMI is only able to read mp3 ID3.x tags (or WMA tags). If you have other version of tags embedded, then it might not be readable and music will be sorted either alphabetically by file name or by file order on media (not sure that). I'd start with software like MP3TAG (http://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to rewrite your files with correct tags. This will not re-encode music itself, just write ned, proper tags into file, so no worry about loss of quality. Hope this solves the problem.","April 24, 2015"
mick1364,I'll look into that over the weekend and try it on that one album to see what it does with the tracks.thanks,"April 24, 2015"
Sq5john,"I'm sure you are correct here, I used to (mistake) think it was the track name that determined the sequence, but it's that hidden # tag that does the deed.","April 24, 2015"

I used MP3TAG with following settings (Tools->Options->Tags->Mpeg):Read: all checkedWrite: checked only ID3v2, ID3v2.3-ISO-8859-1Remove: checked ID3v1, APEI also found some interesting summary of MMI capabilities here (however it is for 2014+):http://pl.scribd.com/doc/229621369/Audi-A4-3G-MMI-Entertainment-System#scribd","April 25, 2015"
mick1364,"Tried the same things I did before with the settings suggested by mirekmal with the same results. It must have something to do with something else that is beyond me. I've never used this software before and really don't know what I'm looking to change to get them to play in the correct order, it all looks right when you see the files in the folder, they are all listed in the order they should play but they don't once they are in the MMI. Other albums play in order but I cannot see why this one would be different.Maybe I need to create a m3u file for this album.","April 25, 2015"
mick1364,"Tried something else, it doesn't need the m3u file to recognise the correct order of play. Just put the track number at the front of each song title and it works. that's less work than creating the m3u files.","April 26, 2015"
