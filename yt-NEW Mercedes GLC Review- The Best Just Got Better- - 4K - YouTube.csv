4,"First of all: Well and professionally made in general, but what I was really missing is kind of a more objective review. This review is like watching somebody directly out of the marketing department of MB talking about their car. Just a high praise of every aspect of the car without any critical point. This is for sure not very plausible, especially since with the previous one, there was quite a lot to complain about. Considering that the current MB interiors in general really look nice, but feel rather cheap from a haptical point of few… and so on… this video simply looks like sponsored by MB. 
Critical comments and points should also be part of a good car review in my opinion.","

I'm 189cm tall and when sat in driver's seat my eyes are at the level of the top of windscreen. I looks at the dashboard like it's on my knees. Door arms inside are made of the horrible cheap, hard plastic and the seat adjusting buttons have no feedback anymore. They feel like they fell off and glued back with a superglue. Beautiful steering wheel ruined by the side buttons which are not real button but some sort of slide over plastic surface. Very disappointed because it looked so promising.","

19,So it feels more like a BMW now when driving. That’s a good thing . The current X3 which is just an LCi is still the class leader as it was for a while now. As usual the interior will date quicker than a BMW and then everyone will complain how Merc is losing their build quality . Then the new X3 new generation will come out next year and still be the best but then miles ahead. Between these two brands it’s a cycle that goes on and on and that’s a good thing. It would be nice to review the Glc from a driving point of view but then by default the reviewer will say it’s nice and if you prefer an engaging drive then the x3 is the one. Also when it comes to interiors once more they will say this new glc ( which is a higher trim level and not the standard one) has a wow factor but the BMW build quality is a bit better.  Once you play with colours inside and configure the colour ways and add optional this and that you can make a alright build quality seem great . Perceived quality is the way things are now. No one talks about the exterior of the glc and it’s side view which is really not great.  The x3 even as old as it is is still the leader. However if there was no x3 then this glc is better than a Q5 most definitely .,"

64,"Sadly, Mercedes build quality have been shocking considering - and I'd opinion them as - they are the most premium German car manufacturer out of the top 3.  I find on their current range, the latch for the glove compartment levers are flimsy, so eventually breaks and the only way to then access the glove compartment is, to sit on the driver's side and without lifting the latch, to pull it towards you, and then lifting it.  Also, these electric tailgates are a huge faff which I could do without.  On their tall hatch back cars, I find that the bolts eventually give way and the hydraulic arms then no longer support the tailgate as it should.  So you end up driving the car with the entire weight of the tailgate resting on the bumper, which means, everytime you drive, you can hear squeeky noise coming from the back and much worse, you can end up with some cracked tail lights.

Lastly, the mood lightling?  Please!  These are features that again, one can do without.  The mood lighting looks aftermarket and so chincy.  If you've never driven a car with it, you may jump onto the hype of wanting to buy a car with one.  But once you have it, the novelty wears of extremely quickly and then, you'd start to regret your decision into why you've bought this feature in the first place, and how you wished you'd just save the money.  Put it this way, mood lighting is as useless as the panoramic sunroof: both of which, you as a driver can never or will ever enjoy.

And this is my honest opion about Mercedes, whether you like it or not.","

67,"Positioning / design of side mirrors to reduce noise / improve efficiency is clever, but it is also a completely standard and universal consideration on any decent car. It is like saying it is clever the car has a steering wheel. ""Which does 0 - 62 in 5.6"", might be a quirky way to assume people know it means mph and seconds but is sloppy and shows wider ignorance, in my opinion. Especially when 'litres' is repeated twice in the same sentence. Someone looking to put three child seats in the back will want to know if it can be done for sure (what a car review could be useful for and mention rival models that achieve this) not what someone 'reckons'. The car selects 'perfect position' for height but in the clip it seems to challenge her reach - a bit ambiguous. 'It turns out the car can do what it is meant to do, it can actually go off road' is introduced through commentary on the infotainment system instead of when reviewing its engine/handling/ performance making it seem contrived to me. Personally, I don't have confidence in this presentation.","

145,"Let me start out by saing: We have decided to buy a Mercedes GLC in some version. But the road to that decision was not easy.

We drive a Nissan Qashqai 130 hp dCi Tekna model year 2013 from 2017 but want a new car, and want to pay for some extra luxury.

We've zeroed in on a Mercedes GLC as our next new car. We have really used time, energy and extensive research online (including of course youtube review videos)... and we've used most of the last many weekends on 'just for fun' car-trial trips to various car dealers to determine, which car is best for us.

Our orignal plan was to just go test the Mercedes E300 de, be wowed, and basically leave our Qashqai with the dealer and drive home in style.

Oh my GOD were we dissappointed :-(

To make a very long story short(ish), we tried (and almost in that order, and some of them multiple times) Mercedes E300de, BMW 320d, Mercedes C220d, BMW 530d (fabulous engine !!!) .

But we were so dissappointed. First off, we expected the Mercedes E300 de to be nearly silent. It was _not_. It was the estate model, or station wagon... anyway, the equivalent of BMW's 'Touring'... the long thing with a gigantic booth.

While the cabin was fantastic, the road noice, especially from the rear of the cabin stunned me. Also, the engine noise!? We came to Kolding (city in Denmark) expecting luxury.

Dissapointed, we then tried the BMW 320d... and it was a LOT more silent and fun/engaging to drive. But this was a base model BMW and OMFG.... the interior was complete plastic everywhere... pure Dacia :-(((((

We drove back home completely dissappointed.

We agreed that if we could've switched the Mercedes cabin/interior to the BMW and the driving experience vice versa.... maybe...

So we got back into our 2017 (model 2013) Nissan Qashqai... and we felt OMFG.... we have an ok car !!!

Trouble is, that we've driven over 200.000 km in that car, and the mechanical failures are piling up now.

Next trouble is: Buying luxury cars = less advanced systems, unless you pay a LOT of extra money!

Our Qashqai Tekna has as standard:
- 360° camera
- Autopilot
- Automatic parking
- 360° cameras and front/rear parking sensors
- Electric heated windshield
- Lane assist
- Blind assist
- City emergency break assist
- Full leather cabin
- Navigation
- Full skyline roof
- Bi-LED headlights
- Electrically adjustable front seat (driver only)
- Heated front seats
- Electric side view mirrors heated and retractible
- Darkened rear windows
- Railings on the roof
- alot of stuff I dont remember...

... and this is the 2013 model Nissan Qashqai Tekna, J11 (!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Extra features, like ""lane assist"" and ""blind assist"", ""back cameras"" systems are enourmously expensive on all the GLC models... but are bloody STANDARD on a damned Nissan at ½ the original price from 2013 ???

Things like the heated windshield I have yet to even see in any of them.

I DO get the difference in quality (to some extend) of the ride and perception of the car, but still..

When we got back into our Qashqai after our first weekend of car trials... we felt HAPPY.

But then.... of course, we tried the Mercedes GLC 350d Coupe... and we were sold. But that car, with that engine was too expensive for us. Not to mention the yearly climate taxes.

But we found the model car we wanted, and next we're going to test the 22d version of the GLC... and even the GLC 300 e plug-in version.

Still.. we are willing to find the extra money for the GLC... especially the Coupe version. Bloody HELL it's cool !","
