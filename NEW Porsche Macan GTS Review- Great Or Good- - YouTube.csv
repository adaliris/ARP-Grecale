8,"I don't know if you want detailed feedback on this new format or not but....

I liked her, good energy, good presentation style. Not yet jaded to lower spec cars from years of hyper performance vehicles etc. Overall I'd be happy with Alex as a new presenter ️ however, it did feel like the content was a bit dumbed down to what Rory's videos are, maybe more aimed at buyers who don't have a lot of auto knowledge? Eg the description of the wheels and brakes were very simplistic, Rory would normally state the tyre size and profile and the diameter of brakes etc etc. if you're planning to use Alex as for lower tier car marketing style videos, it'll work I reckon. But I assume most of us watch the performance car type videos WANTING to know the small details. And the lack of any specifics other than 'its good and it's fast' wouldn't cut it for me in future videos to be honest.","

Rory is good at presenting 'cos he's been at it for a long time. As far as I'm concerned Alex did a wonderful job and will get better with time. 
Reminds me of when Doug reviewed a car for the second time cos he felt the first time (which was years ago) he wasn't as thorough.

Rory?  He is in rare company.  Among other things, he knows he has a broad audience.  Not all have the means to purchase a McLaren or Bentley.  There are those who simply want an electric SUV that is suitable for young family.  These souls may want their daily to be a Lotus, but they most consider things like space for baby car seat and stroller. What does Rory do?  He reviews both.","

116,"Autotrader, I think you missed a trick here. Why is Rory so popular? Because he's different. He's Black, eloquent without being posh, and he has swag - style with a common touch. Alexander is posh, highly polished and comes over very much as a professional journalist.

Absolutely nothing wrong with all that but why not take chance with a female Rory? Someone not posh, possibly even from an ethnic minority and with an individual style? Risky? Nah, not really. Look at how popular going against the grain with has worked out.

All the best of luck with Alex but you're giving us something we already have in abundance on other shows/channels. Vicky Butler Henderson gave us what your new presenter does more than a decade ago","

It's like driving a bouncy castle and when you put it in Sport mode it feels like the tyres are made of concrete. Porsche cannot have  developed this car properly for it to drive this way. The steering is devoid of feedback or feel. It's not quite the worst car I've driven (that was my dad's Morris Marina) but by a long way it's the worst Porsche I've had. I cannot see how making if faster would help as I have to drive it well below the speed limit just to avoid getting sea sick. My BMW 530 was way better on the same roads and my wife's Mini Cooper would leave it for dead. Save your money. Don't buy one. And it rattles non stop, which Porsche cannot fix. Pile of poo.","

244,"Ms. Legouix is - according to her own website - “Host, Voice Artist, Psychotherapist,  Yoga & Mindfulness Coach…(and not least) TV Presenter”.  What she is NOT is what Clarkson and May are: motoring journalists who write…and think….and write…then talk. 

Of course, after the very unsuccessful TG they moved onto a string of other failures.

Quiz Show hosts (primarily) and ex-cricketers and mindfulness coaches now abound. That’s why Top Gear and the rest is so better than before.

Who needs people who are real writers when anyone can rock up with a set of good teeth and pre-rehearsed banter. Right ?","

256,"She made a pretty bad first impression on me. The first thing she does is disrespect rory, the person that made this channel succesfull, i know it is meant as a joke but it comes across as very condescending. She tells him that she is better and a professional and the tone of her voice in that conversation seems to show her extreme drive to be succesfull wherever she works. I can tell she dislikes being new on the channel because of her passive agression when rory said it was his channel. She seems to get triggered and started telling him she was better than him. Even pushed him trying to show she is not afraid. 

I think there are others ways to do your first impression, like respect rory and be thankfull for the opportunity the channel gives you. Just be respectfull and kind to a person every viewer likes. Give the audience some time to get to know your soft side. Later in the relastionship between rory and alex she can show a bit of teasing. And that teasing can develop into a fun communicationstyle between the two. 

Something else I noticed was that from the moment the camera was on her alone in the car, she suddenly calmes down and tries to be sweet and kind. 
I think i already know what she is all about. A very competitive woman who wants to show how great she is because deep down it frustrates her she works in a men industry. Ofcourse, i cant be sure. But i have this feeling because of her first impression. i hope i judged her character wrong.","
