0,"It looks like a Macan, especially from the front, but nicer overall. $92,000 is a lot of money for a 4 cylinder turbo. At that price, I think there are better options at this price like the BMW X3 or X4 M Competition. Great review Joe.","

1,"Been waiting for this one! Many people say the base Macan is almost the perfect performance SUV. The lighter engine and just-good-enough power allowing you to have mind-blasting fun while still staying mostly legal. This to me is the new alternative. That is probably one of the best sounding 4-cylinders I've heard, about as good as the AMG M139. This is why it pays to stay in school kids! ","

3,"I am glad to see your description mentions the true competitors this vehicle was designed to go up against.  It was not created to compete with the Stelvio Q because its based on the same platform and built in the same facility.  The way Stellantis has cast the line-up from smallest to largest is as follows  Tonale < Stelvio < Grecale < Levante.  Even though the Grecale is built on the same platform as the Stelvio, it is technically the larger of the two.  Its most direct competitor is the Porsche Macan that is where Maserati set their sights when they first started playing around with concepts years ago and was repeated again by its leadership.   What the Italians do with 4 Cylinder engines is truly impressive.  I have to admit that I am a Maserati loyalists, now having owned 5 in total.  There are a couple of things I see with the interior that need some polish so I imagine when I decide to go from my Levante to one of these I will be checking to see if that fit and finish has been fixed or if I am going to be requesting the dealership get the fixes done.  I have done that before on my Maserati's.  Yea sure it should be right from the start but it isn't and it doesn't stop me from buying it.","

My real life opinion, it sounds cheap, ride is underwhelming, materials might as well be a Dodge. For my wife, 5'4 115 it is spacious enough, zero complaints. admittedly  I'm  getting a little older and the down side is I had enough cars in my life to realize that cars simply aren't made like they used to. I drive a 2022 Ram anniversary edition and it has cooling rear seats, you mean to tell me for 92k they couldn't do the same? I said all of this just to say it's not worth the price, buy some Legos and build your own car. This is possibly worth 60-65k tops!

14,"I would really love some opinions for this car as I just feel as if it’s a little bit of a let down for me, I was very excited to hear about a ‘baby Levante’ and a brand that finally can compete with the Porsche Macan, but it really didn’t meet up to my expectations. 
Personally this is a great looking compact SUV. However I have been comparing it to its closest competitor the Porsche Macan and if your in the market for the two; it does not make ANY sense to get the Maserati Grecale. 
For Performance comparing the base Models, yes the Grecale has more power with 291HP in comparison to the 4 Cylinder Macans 261HP however the Porsche is 80KG lighter, and utilises Porsches lightening fast PDK. The handling on the Macan has always been praised and has set precedent alongside the X3 for this market. I’m not so sure that Maserati with the same underpinnings as the Alfa Stelvio (although the Giorgio platform is great on the QV I’m not so sure on the lower trim Stelvios) 
For technology the Porsche also just seems more user friendly with Porsches PCM (Porsche Communication Management) found on the new 95B Porsche Macan with the digital haptic capacity buttons from the Panamera and Cayenne are incredibly easy to utilise in comparison to MASERATI who aren’t exactly known for innovation and pioneering in technology. Furthermore the interior design is pretty disappointing, the Lexus NX or Genesis GV70 have FAR prettier interiors.
The build quality and reliability is also something to consider. Even a base model Porsche Macan is praised for its exceptional interior quality and its reliability. My family has had all three generations of Macan from the 2016 GTS, a 2019 GTS and the brand new 2022 GTS. We only had a slight fault with the tire pressure sensor and that’s about it. My biggest concern is that underneath that Gorgeous MASERATI body, it’s still a Dodge or an Alfa and even Maserati itself from the Ghibli show it’s a scary prospect to own a Maserati.
The main reason I say these things is that a Maserati Grecale in Australia starts at $121,000…whilst a Base Porsche Macan is $101,000…I genuinely thought this car would have been priced to match the Macan which is already very expensive in comparison to an X4 or a Q5 or a GLC. The Macan S is $130,000 and it has a V6 and it’s more in line with the Trofeo in Performance for an extra $9,000. 
I do believe the Grecale has more standard options considering it would be easier to diffuse a bomb than spec out a brand new Porsche with the 8,000 overwhelming and in all honesty, pointless options. But I just find it inexcusable. 
The Grecale is gorgeous, but it is frightening similar in design to a $32,000 Ford Puma.","
