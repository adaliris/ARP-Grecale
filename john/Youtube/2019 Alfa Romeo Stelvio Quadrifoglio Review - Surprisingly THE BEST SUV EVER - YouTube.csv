I've had so many Dodge and Jeep vehicles as rentals and I just hate everything about them.  Fit, finish, feel, everything.  And I know, different company, but are they really?  Look at those stocks, their out of the Chrysler parts bin.  Plus, I'm definitely worried about reliability and cost of ownership.  Maybe they'll prove me wrong and I'll reconsider, but for now, I can't put AR on my list :-(  They look like such great cars to drive.","

Can't wait to see your review of the Giulia, it's an amazing car.

8,"Last autumn I rented an Abarth 595 for an alpine roadtrip, and unfortunately they did not have any. So Avis gave us an Stelvio 2.0 with 280hp. I wasn't super excited since I thought the abarth would have been more fun, but holy shit. Hands down the best driving SUV that I have ever driven. I have thousands of kms from an x3 and glc plus some in a q5. And they are just boring, floaty cars.
The stelvio is dynamically on a totally different level, even the base model. I had the same reaction when I testdrove the Giulia. So good. Good enough that I just don't care that an x3 has a better interior quality or that the merc is quieter (btw atleast 2019 glcs don't have lining in the doorpockets, you get that shit on a golf even. Smh mercedes)

One point a cayman as was behind us going downhill and he only overtook us when we started to slowdown to save brakes. The old geeza honked and waved I guess he also enjoyed blasting down a mountain with an suv. Oh and yes our rental Stelvio visited the Stelvio.","

There is no mechanical assistance for anything.  The interior is surprisingly roomy too.  I own a 2010 Audi TT-S roadster.  My Audi TT-S is a two-seater, and the Alfa Rome 4C has a LOT more space than my Audi.  I also loved that the turbocharged engine was directly behind my head so I could hear all of the sexy noises.

I wish you actually spent more time talking about the wheels, because they are unreal. They look so delicate, and allow you to see the brake calipers all the time.

30,"Wow, I asked, you delivered! 

Since it was one of my possible choices until recently, here is what I think:
- price - good, they offer nice discount even on the QV
- Carbon brakes? No need.
- Seats? You should try the ""regular"" Alfa seats, they are awesome, always have been.
- No heads-up for no reason.
- Too much carbon? Yes, lower trims look better in some ways (not the lack of red Start button).
- Quality? Not even half way there yet. Plastics and OEM feeling. Alfa always does this.
- Headlights? Don't like them, and the outline goes down until turnlights are on. No idea why.
- Taillights too suck.

Now, the worst:

- It doesn't looks as good as expected for the price. It costs as much as X4M or GLC C43 AMG Coupe, or an F-Pace and Velar. Needs few touches to become good though. (but hey, I hate Macans and Q8s) 
- Has to be red if you ask me and the paint has faults (looks different on plastic and metal)

- Profile also not nearly as good as expected. 
- No air suspension.
- the dna shifter and lack of configurable mode.

And I'd still love to have it because:
- Awesome sound.
- Glued to the road like no other SUV. Forget F-Pace.
- The steering, 12.1:1 ratio!
- Revvy, awesome sounding engine.
- It is so light in its class!
- The exhaust pipes.
- Those calipers!
- 505 hp engine that says the f-word to every other V6 petrol engine in the SUV world, every single one","

Here's one thing you might not have addressed:  Given that there's a Porsche Macan out there, amazing in its own right, how do you feel about Stelvio-Quad ownership--you know the Porsche isn't going to not start or leave you stranded, right?  What is your sense of how reliable it would be--even for a couple of years?  Thanks!","

There were a couple of occasions when you did refer to the car as a ' Chrysler ' product or said that 'it is Chrysler thing' . Maybe because I am from Europe, but i see this car as a true Italian car built from the rich history of italian automaking. So calling it a Chrysler makes me think of a grey unintuitive car. Which is the total opposite of what this Stelvio represents.
I am just adding my point to this video, which i liked. But this car is far from any Chrysler.","

Sportsmans Guide used to sell Piloti shoes for cheap! ik i shudda bought some, woops? btw, they're designed to be worn when driving a vehicle with a manual trans on longer trips esp to reduce discomfort whilst applying the clutch pedal. plus stylish as heck. when the Giulia Quadrifoglio ad 1st hit tv awhile back, i was instantly in love. However, being more of a budget guy..id go Dodge Journey or Charger, Chally..Jeeps etc at $25-35k (or a nice used example for half that. starting to see a 440 wheel hp machine for the price of..a frikin Aveo?) and spend $5k on a supercharger..either from RIPP or Edelbrock..whomever. Ik with the RIPP, you're at about SRT Hemi hp levels with one atop of a 3.6L, in other words, within bottle rocket distance of the $100k Alfa's hp here.

We have a 2018 (build in 2017) Giulia Ti in the family and I love it to death when it's not in the shop. Reliability is fine exept for ours that have wierd disease of vibrating when transmission shifts. Although don't be scared future buyers as nobody seems to have the same problem on any forum and none of the several dealerships we've dealt with have encountered it either.","

486,"This is a great SUV for those who can afford something equally as nice (and far more dependable) to drive around in while their Stelvio is in for repairs. And make no doubt about it; this vehicle will be spending a prodigious amount of time in the shop. A quick look at it's lineage, and stablemates should be more than convincing, and serve as sufficient warning. Aside from the fact that parent company Fiat isn't exactly known for it's reliability, their list of subsidiaries poses a specter that is even more frightening. (can you say Maserati?)  Add to this the fact that you are buying a car from a niche manufacturer (Alfa), which is owned by a company not known for it's build quality (Fiat), with a bastardized engine stuffed under the hood (Ferrari), and all I can do is wish you luck when you break down in the middle of nowhere, (and you will).

When I saw one of these at an auto show I went to take a look.  First thing I touched was the gas tank cover, which felt as flimsy and plastic as my old Alfa.

I think (I may be wrong) that in the long term, the reliability and cheapness would definitely wipe out any of the initial excitement.  It may be fun for a test drive, but I just don't see this being a keeper in the long run.  Once bitten, twice shy.","

Also there is absolutely no need to climax over exhaust tips, unless that is what truly does it for you. In all honesty you will be paying solely for the engine itself, there is nothing else with this vehicle that’s screams luxury sport at all. If you chucked this engine into a Kia you would be just as happy and your bank account wouldn’t have been drained. You know what I want....... a F ing review by someone that actually owns one and not people either being paid to do one that have no idea what they are talking about or people renting a vehicle for the day like they’ve stolen the neighbors car.

575,"Why dct’s fart:
  Volkswagen came up with the concept of retarding ignition timing at the crucial moment of the gear change, effectively mimicking the act of lifting off the throttle.  However fuelling and valve timing remain unaffected under this programming setup.  This results in excess fuel being deposited into the combustion chamber, remaining un-ignited.  When the next gear is engaged, ignition of the fuel is resumed via the spark plugs, and the excess fuel in the combustion chamber and exhaust manifold ignites creating that lovely “vroomph” fart/burp that we all know and love.”  Info via https://www.torquingcars.com/tech-talk/tech-talk-why-do-dsgs-burp/","

In fact, Fiat bought Chrysler after it filed for bankrupcy. so it is a bit weird that you guys gave shouts to Chrysler, given that they probably had very little input into this car. FIAT calls the shots, plain and simple.  Any merits to this car go to Alpha and FIAT alone. i.e.: the downsized Ferrarri engine, and so on. I even risk to say that the only contribution that Chrysler had to this car are the negative points you mentioned... steering wheel and console buttons, etc.","

The Stelvio doesn't need launch control because it doesn't spin the tires off the line. The Trackhawk pulls harder off the line for two reasons not mentioned here: 1) The Trackhawk is all-wheel drive. 2) The Trackhawk is supercharged, not turbocharged. Launch control has nothing to do with it. From a slow roll, the Stelvio kills the Trackhawk.","
