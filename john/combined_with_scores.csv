3,"I absolutely love the design of the Stelvio and the Giulia and 4C.  The Giulia would be on my list of cars for my next purchase, but I'm just having trouble getting past the whole FCA thing.  I've had so many Dodge and Jeep vehicles as rentals and I just hate everything about them.  Fit, finish, feel, everything.  And I know, different company, but are they really?  Look at those stocks, their out of the Chrysler parts bin.  Plus, I'm definitely worried about reliability and cost of ownership.  Maybe they'll prove me wrong and I'll reconsider, but for now, I can't put AR on my list :-(  They look like such great cars to drive.","

4,"I believe the reason behind the column mounted shifters is that traditionally, a person should not be shifting mid-corner. They should be putting the car in the right gear before the turn, and focus on balancing the car through the turn rather than upset the car with gear shifting. Correct me if I'm wrong!

Can't wait to see your review of the Giulia, it's an amazing car.

8,"Last autumn I rented an Abarth 595 for an alpine roadtrip, and unfortunately they did not have any. So Avis gave us an Stelvio 2.0 with 280hp. I wasn't super excited since I thought the abarth would have been more fun, but holy shit. Hands down the best driving SUV that I have ever driven. I have thousands of kms from an x3 and glc plus some in a q5. And they are just boring, floaty cars.
The stelvio is dynamically on a totally different level, even the base model. I had the same reaction when I testdrove the Giulia. So good. Good enough that I just don't care that an x3 has a better interior quality or that the merc is quieter (btw atleast 2019 glcs don't have lining in the doorpockets, you get that shit on a golf even. Smh mercedes)

One point a cayman as was behind us going downhill and he only overtook us when we started to slowdown to save brakes. The old geeza honked and waved I guess he also enjoyed blasting down a mountain with an suv. Oh and yes our rental Stelvio visited the Stelvio.","

There is no mechanical assistance for anything.  The interior is surprisingly roomy too.  I own a 2010 Audi TT-S roadster.  My Audi TT-S is a two-seater, and the Alfa Rome 4C has a LOT more space than my Audi.  I also loved that the turbocharged engine was directly behind my head so I could hear all of the sexy noises.

I wish you actually spent more time talking about the wheels, because they are unreal. They look so delicate, and allow you to see the brake calipers all the time.

30,"Wow, I asked, you delivered! 

Since it was one of my possible choices until recently, here is what I think:
- price - good, they offer nice discount even on the QV
- Carbon brakes? No need.
- Seats? You should try the ""regular"" Alfa seats, they are awesome, always have been.
- No heads-up for no reason.
- Too much carbon? Yes, lower trims look better in some ways (not the lack of red Start button).
- Quality? Not even half way there yet. Plastics and OEM feeling. Alfa always does this.
- Headlights? Don't like them, and the outline goes down until turnlights are on. No idea why.
- Taillights too suck.

Now, the worst:

- It doesn't looks as good as expected for the price. It costs as much as X4M or GLC C43 AMG Coupe, or an F-Pace and Velar. Needs few touches to become good though. (but hey, I hate Macans and Q8s) 
- Has to be red if you ask me and the paint has faults (looks different on plastic and metal)

- Profile also not nearly as good as expected. 
- No air suspension.
- the dna shifter and lack of configurable mode.

And I'd still love to have it because:
- Awesome sound.
- Glued to the road like no other SUV. Forget F-Pace.
- The steering, 12.1:1 ratio!
- Revvy, awesome sounding engine.
- It is so light in its class!
- The exhaust pipes.
- Those calipers!
- 505 hp engine that says the f-word to every other V6 petrol engine in the SUV world, every single one","

There were a couple of occasions when you did refer to the car as a ' Chrysler ' product or said that 'it is Chrysler thing' . Maybe because I am from Europe, but i see this car as a true Italian car built from the rich history of italian automaking. So calling it a Chrysler makes me think of a grey unintuitive car. Which is the total opposite of what this Stelvio represents.
I am just adding my point to this video, which i liked. But this car is far from any Chrysler.","

Sportsmans Guide used to sell Piloti shoes for cheap! ik i shudda bought some, woops? btw, they're designed to be worn when driving a vehicle with a manual trans on longer trips esp to reduce discomfort whilst applying the clutch pedal. plus stylish as heck. when the Giulia Quadrifoglio ad 1st hit tv awhile back, i was instantly in love. However, being more of a budget guy..id go Dodge Journey or Charger, Chally..Jeeps etc at $25-35k (or a nice used example for half that. starting to see a 440 wheel hp machine for the price of..a frikin Aveo?) and spend $5k on a supercharger..either from RIPP or Edelbrock..whomever. Ik with the RIPP, you're at about SRT Hemi hp levels with one atop of a 3.6L, in other words, within bottle rocket distance of the $100k Alfa's hp here.

The cannollis are amazing. The waiting chairs are really soft nappa leather.  But while fca...fiat/ chrysler/alfa romeos put so much love into show/repair rooms when more couldve put into quality control/build quality so you did not have the check engine light starring you in the face consistently with no reason. And since it is an fca product you got that unsold ralleye orange dodgo dart that has a 4yo sticker on it sitting next to popcorn machine.  All for a pretty sweet $114,000 alfa crossove.","

486,"This is a great SUV for those who can afford something equally as nice (and far more dependable) to drive around in while their Stelvio is in for repairs. And make no doubt about it; this vehicle will be spending a prodigious amount of time in the shop. A quick look at it's lineage, and stablemates should be more than convincing, and serve as sufficient warning. Aside from the fact that parent company Fiat isn't exactly known for it's reliability, their list of subsidiaries poses a specter that is even more frightening. (can you say Maserati?)  Add to this the fact that you are buying a car from a niche manufacturer (Alfa), which is owned by a company not known for it's build quality (Fiat), with a bastardized engine stuffed under the hood (Ferrari), and all I can do is wish you luck when you break down in the middle of nowhere, (and you will).

When I saw one of these at an auto show I went to take a look.  First thing I touched was the gas tank cover, which felt as flimsy and plastic as my old Alfa.

I think (I may be wrong) that in the long term, the reliability and cheapness would definitely wipe out any of the initial excitement.  It may be fun for a test drive, but I just don't see this being a keeper in the long run.  Once bitten, twice shy.","

Don't buy this as your only car, or else your Alfa Dealer would at most give you a Fiat 500 as a courtesy car while your Stelvio gets repairs after repairs.","

  Volkswagen came up with the concept of retarding ignition timing at the crucial moment of the gear change, effectively mimicking the act of lifting off the throttle.  However fuelling and valve timing remain unaffected under this programming setup.  This results in excess fuel being deposited into the combustion chamber, remaining un-ignited.  When the next gear is engaged, ignition of the fuel is resumed via the spark plugs, and the excess fuel in the combustion chamber and exhaust manifold ignites creating that lovely “vroomph” fart/burp that we all know and love.”  Info via https://www.torquingcars.com/tech-talk/tech-talk-why-do-dsgs-burp/","

In fact, Fiat bought Chrysler after it filed for bankrupcy. so it is a bit weird that you guys gave shouts to Chrysler, given that they probably had very little input into this car. FIAT calls the shots, plain and simple.  Any merits to this car go to Alpha and FIAT alone. i.e.: the downsized Ferrarri engine, and so on. I even risk to say that the only contribution that Chrysler had to this car are the negative points you mentioned... steering wheel and console buttons, etc.","

The Stelvio doesn't need launch control because it doesn't spin the tires off the line. The Trackhawk pulls harder off the line for two reasons not mentioned here: 1) The Trackhawk is all-wheel drive. 2) The Trackhawk is supercharged, not turbocharged. Launch control has nothing to do with it. From a slow roll, the Stelvio kills the Trackhawk.","

Given that the modern diesel motors are cut in power due to environment regulations, for most people I guess 2.0T would be the most adequate choice if you average 20-25 thousand KM per year. If you do more than 50 thousand km, then the economy from diesel will be more substantial. However I doubt it is very important in 50-60k USD car.","

So unless you can get a big discount, the diesels are the ones to go for as the engine suits the car a lot better and has better fuel economy over the petrol. The car is still very spec sensitive, with black alloy wheels to be avoided, plus arguably not as good looking at versions of a few years back too.","

But you have to understand that they sell these cars globally and here in South Africa for instance we use coins and cash a lot still. As well as a lot of the older folks still have Iphone 5's and 6's so they fir nicely in those smaller areas. I understand for the EU market it might be weird but the EU cars are sold almost as is in the African market so I guess that is why they keep some of these smaller things.

4. Mat’s showing off drifting constantly when no need.
5. The same old tired format of reviewing the car, please change it up a little.

At times, He is profaned by those who claim to follow Him but do not act in His will. They do evil and say it is His will when it is not. God will not let His name remain profaned. He will make unbelievers know that He is God and that He is good. Maybe you know someone who drags God’s name through the mud. That can be frustrating and even infuriating to watch. Take heart. God is mightier than them. He will make Himself known. /prayer+ LORD, You are mighty and good. You will make Your character known. Show Your might to the nations. Make unbelievers tremble at the knowledge of You. Show them You are God. You have the power to do anything. Let Your will be done. Let men bow before You and know that You are God.

1. Real BMW L6 engine delivers more than 510 bhp
2. Real Alfa V6 engine delivers less than 510 bhp
3. A better Mechanical Grip for BMW/better tyres.","

Which means that after around 62 mph it is even faster than a bmw.     And as for the Porsche. : That is no match for the Alfa.   

And when going on a track. : The alfa beats its rivals even more........  It has made nurburgring world record if you may forget...","

15,"I've been driving this exact same car, same colour, same hybrid version since October 2021. So, here's my take on it. Brilliant!!! I even have the  real M-Sports seats (not these standard seats shown here), which are a delight, both optically and from a comfort aspect. The engine, in Sport Mode, with that extra battery power to boost acceleration, is really amazing. Top speed? Well, I live in Germany so am often on the Autobahn. 200kph is no problem and the car sits like it's stuck to the road. Handling is good, interior is pleasing and very functional, I agree that the front is not the most attractive car on the road. Negatives? The battery range is crap. However.... The displayed battery range depends on how you have driven the car before depleting the battery. If you were pedal to the metal all the time, the range after the next charge will be crap. If you were driving conservatively, accelerating slowly and using the cruise control, you will get a displayed range of over 40 km. What you won't ever get is the advertised 55 kms. My last car was the 2 litre X3 diesel. The car before that was the 3,5 litre 4 Series Grand Coupé. I do have some small complaints, but on the whole am very happy. Oh yeh, I test drove the Mercedes GLC 300e Plug in Hybrid. Full battery, in October, 19 degrees C ambient temperature. Range, 19 kilometers. Yes, Mercedes bullshits too!!!","

16,"I came from a 981 Cayman S that I had driven daily for 10 years to an X3 M40i. I'm so impressed with the car, it's the perfect blend of practicality, comfort, and performance when you need it. Sure it doesn't quite have the poise and fun handling of the Cayman, but it's so much easier to live with in a 1 car garage. I was worried about reviewers saying the ride was harsh, to me on terrible Scottish road surfaces it's really comfortable without being wafty, really quiet on the interior too. Love that this model has proper buttons rather than touchscreen everything. Only thing I really miss is the Burmeister Stereo from the Porsche, the Harman Kardon isn't even close to that (although that was a £3k option so can't expect it to be. I cross shopped with a Macan S / GTS, and the BMW was £20-30k cheaper with similar options, a no brainer.","

Great car, does everything previous X5 40D family car did & more. Hybrid, any manufacturer/model - No-Way, modern financial rip-off. Negatives, lower seat driving position than an X5, if this is important. Strange wheel sizing especially when changing from summer to winter tyres (Had to buy 4 new tyres plus 4 new wheels at same time. No winter or all season tyres made by any Tyre manufacturer for UK market, for 21 inch BMW X3 LCI wheels - Yet available in N America). Due to date when ordered, wireless charging was deleted. No rear heated seats option when date ordered. Once car passes 3 year point from new, BMW's become expensive to maintain. Positives, drives like a sports car, not an SUV, reasonable petrol fuel economy, does everything X5 did previously. Highly recommend BMW LCI X3 M40I. NOTE: Tyre manufacturers need to keep-up with modern wheel sizing of new vehicles, so consumers can have options to drive safely on winter/summer/all season tyres in UK.","

I have a 2021 x3 M40i and the power is addictive but very accessible. The X3M on my test drive was not compatible with commuting due to a super harsh suspension. Audi, MB, and Volvo can’t come close to this combo of power, fuel economy, cargo space and passenger space…plus the infotainment is really great. Exhaust note is also maturing nicely over time. Interesting to note that the highway mph actually went down with the mild hybrid system and the US EPA found no benefit with city mpg. In Ecopro mode this will reliably get 25-27 mpg on the highway at high speed (~75-80mph). I love this car!","

Starting with the current M3/4, it looks like they are making M even more hardcore and using the M-sport to satisfy all the people who want a more daily-livable M-car. Ergo the Mx40i cars getting all the badges, the mirrors, and even the special edition M-things like the retro emblem. Also why they are getting way more performant than they have ever been before.","

Ultimately, the M40i drove very well, was better damped and sounded better. The x3/X4M just are not as intense as you’d hope, and when you consider gas/maint/insurance it’s not just a few hundred difference. Don’t forget the engine is tuned more NA on M’s which is frustrating in daily driving. I used to hate these M performance cars after 5 M’s but I put my ego aside and ended up enjoying these.

The make such excellent cars in terms of handling, ride quality, engine, technology, interioand exterior quality nd their interiors are really good. And then they fuck up the exterior design sometimes little bit, sometimes a lot. And the thing that frustrates me the most, is that they do it on purpose. Previous gen bmws were some of the most beautiful cars on the road. And its not just that the design is bad, they mess up their design language, desig language the had for years. Example, wanna put an new grill on the 4series, cool, but dont mess up the sidelines, keep the strong, original, bmw like.  The new x3 front and back are just all over the place. the tailights especially, wtf. Same goes for the new 2series coupe, such beautiful and sporty car anfd then the front lights and rear light are rear design are wack. Somebody needs to bring the message to bmw. They have fucked up and need to fix it insteaa of just insisting on their new way just because they cant admitt their shit.","

The lighter engine and just-good-enough power allowing you to have mind-blasting fun while still staying mostly legal. This to me is the new alternative. That is probably one of the best sounding 4-cylinders I've heard, about as good as the AMG M139. This is why it pays to stay in school kids! ","

3,"I am glad to see your description mentions the true competitors this vehicle was designed to go up against.  It was not created to compete with the Stelvio Q because its based on the same platform and built in the same facility.  The way Stellantis has cast the line-up from smallest to largest is as follows  Tonale < Stelvio < Grecale < Levante.  Even though the Grecale is built on the same platform as the Stelvio, it is technically the larger of the two.  Its most direct competitor is the Porsche Macan that is where Maserati set their sights when they first started playing around with concepts years ago and was repeated again by its leadership.   What the Italians do with 4 Cylinder engines is truly impressive.  I have to admit that I am a Maserati loyalists, now having owned 5 in total.  There are a couple of things I see with the interior that need some polish so I imagine when I decide to go from my Levante to one of these I will be checking to see if that fit and finish has been fixed or if I am going to be requesting the dealership get the fixes done.  I have done that before on my Maserati's.  Yea sure it should be right from the start but it isn't and it doesn't stop me from buying it.","

My real life opinion, it sounds cheap, ride is underwhelming, materials might as well be a Dodge. For my wife, 5'4 115 it is spacious enough, zero complaints. admittedly  I'm  getting a little older and the down side is I had enough cars in my life to realize that cars simply aren't made like they used to. I drive a 2022 Ram anniversary edition and it has cooling rear seats, you mean to tell me for 92k they couldn't do the same? I said all of this just to say it's not worth the price, buy some Legos and build your own car. This is possibly worth 60-65k tops!

21,Bella è bella. Ha personalità e un ottimo appeal ma come ha sottolineato Giuliano un selettore fisico del cambio e una personalizzazione delle impostazioni (in stile audì drive select) avrebbe chiuso il cerchio rendendola quasi perfetta. Il peso si fa sentire (2 tonnellate) ed è più giusto definirlo un suv granturismo che sportivo. Parlando di allestimenti i 30cv in più e qualche particolare non possono giustificare i 10mila euro in più della Modena. Lo sforzo tecnico-stilistico è comunque notevole ma IMHO manca ancora un piccolo step per battere la concorrenza (Macan),"

Mentre un orologio analogico fa tutt'altra scena.
Due vuole sfidare Macan e altri suv di lusso MA l'unico motore a 6 cilindri sta sopra i 100mila!!! E per un 4 cilindri, seppur con 330cv si parte da 75mila... il numero di cilindri conta quando si parla di queste cifre soprattutto in mercati come quello Americano (abituato ai V8) e quello cinese che è fatto di ostentazione. Vuoi fare un suv di lusso i motori devono essere tutti ALMENO con 6 cilindri. Per il resto l'auto è davvero bella e spero possa vendere tantissimo e magari tirasi dietro qualche Stelvio in più... auto che non ha avuto il successo che meritava.","

Il treno estivo di primo equipaggiamento contribuisce in maniera sostanziale a modificare il piacere di guida di questa auto costringendomi ad utilizzare la taratura sport degli ammortizzatori per avere un feedback quanto meno accettabile. La cosa veramente strana che mi ha portato a fare queste considerazioni è che ho sostituito il treno di gomme estive di primo equipaggiamento con delle Bridgestone invernali. Tutta un'altra musica!!!! Con le ""invernali"" l'auto è completamente diversa.. Stabile, non beccheggia, più silenziosa cose che di solito non capitano con gli pneumatici invernali.

Over the years I have found that BMW interior materials tend to mark, wrinkle and break down much sooner than similar M-B materials (especially BMW's thin/crappy seat upholstery and carpets). These items are always made better in Mercedes Benz autos. BMW durability is plainly lacking, even though when brand new things might feel a bit softer. Actually they are just that much easier to blemish and show wear. I believe this M-B GLC has no equal in this size/price range. It will likely last quite a bit longer, cost less to maintain, and gives you that Three Pointed Star CURB APPEAL that all BMW's lack. Propeller emblem? - A joke by comparison.","

Suggest switching out the brake pads for ceramics immediately after brake pad light comes on.  You can avoid replacing the expensive rotors. The ceramic pads have very little brake dust.

Я очень сильно устал от войны.
Мы Украинци   очень благодарны Вам Англичанам за помощь которую Вы нам оказываете.
Теперь немного по теме.
Я смотрю Ваши видео как фантастические фильмы.Честным путем в Украине заработать на такой автомобиль  практически не возможно.Только у политиков и их детей.Примерно  85% Украинцев ездят на старых авто.,которые  в Польше или в Германии ездили уже лет 10.Потом эти авто попадают в Украину и тут еще  лет  10 ездят.И все берегут эти старые авто,потому что новое авто не купишь.И это не потому что люди ленивые и не хотят честно работать.Наше правительство нас постоянно обворовывало.За последние 30 лет только теперь в Украинцев сильный,умный и честный президент-Зеленский.
Ты можешь себе представить что-бы в 21 веке  работающей семье  было трудно отремонтировать автомобиль 1980 года выпуска?!
Я иногда вижу по телевизору шоу в которых  ради забавы разбивают авто.У меня слезы  появляются на глазах от мысли что на той хоть и старой машине можна зделать  много полезных дел для семьи.
Не хочу говорить о грусном.Мэт ты хороший и веселый и умный парень.Снимай дальше свои хорошие видео.Это помогает мне немного отвлечься от войны.

And I don't know about UK, but in Australia electricity prices have gone up 30% in the last 8 mths meanwhile fuel prices are finally starting to drop. Which negates the purchase of a plug in hybrid.

If the other driver wouldn't have stopped (which you assumed she would), you would have to answer the police and pay for the damages. People who do such crap, should be stripped off their driving licence, because this clearly isn't safe driving. I don't know if you did it for fun purpose; frankly, it was no fun to watch! This is just not acceptable! Especially if you are sitting in a Mercedes. Leave the low-life shit for BMW and AUDI drivers, and please honor the car and drive it with prestige. If I could ever afford this car, I would certainly drive in a way which would tell people on the road, that I really do deserve it :)

Considering that the current MB interiors in general really look nice, but feel rather cheap from a haptical point of few… and so on… this video simply looks like sponsored by MB. 
Critical comments and points should also be part of a good car review in my opinion.","

People that say they want him back should decide if they want growth and more content where creators get time to fly and review different things and events or they want Rory to do everything with limited content while other channels like SuperCarBlondie are growing and delegating content. This video is quality even without Rorisang, because it already has his essence. He wouldn't bring someone who don't know what they're talking about.","

I'm 189cm tall and when sat in driver's seat my eyes are at the level of the top of windscreen. I looks at the dashboard like it's on my knees. Door arms inside are made of the horrible cheap, hard plastic and the seat adjusting buttons have no feedback anymore. They feel like they fell off and glued back with a superglue. Beautiful steering wheel ruined by the side buttons which are not real button but some sort of slide over plastic surface. Very disappointed because it looked so promising.","

19,So it feels more like a BMW now when driving. That’s a good thing . The current X3 which is just an LCi is still the class leader as it was for a while now. As usual the interior will date quicker than a BMW and then everyone will complain how Merc is losing their build quality . Then the new X3 new generation will come out next year and still be the best but then miles ahead. Between these two brands it’s a cycle that goes on and on and that’s a good thing. It would be nice to review the Glc from a driving point of view but then by default the reviewer will say it’s nice and if you prefer an engaging drive then the x3 is the one. Also when it comes to interiors once more they will say this new glc ( which is a higher trim level and not the standard one) has a wow factor but the BMW build quality is a bit better.  Once you play with colours inside and configure the colour ways and add optional this and that you can make a alright build quality seem great . Perceived quality is the way things are now. No one talks about the exterior of the glc and it’s side view which is really not great.  The x3 even as old as it is is still the leader. However if there was no x3 then this glc is better than a Q5 most definitely .,"

64,"Sadly, Mercedes build quality have been shocking considering - and I'd opinion them as - they are the most premium German car manufacturer out of the top 3.  I find on their current range, the latch for the glove compartment levers are flimsy, so eventually breaks and the only way to then access the glove compartment is, to sit on the driver's side and without lifting the latch, to pull it towards you, and then lifting it.  Also, these electric tailgates are a huge faff which I could do without.  On their tall hatch back cars, I find that the bolts eventually give way and the hydraulic arms then no longer support the tailgate as it should.  So you end up driving the car with the entire weight of the tailgate resting on the bumper, which means, everytime you drive, you can hear squeeky noise coming from the back and much worse, you can end up with some cracked tail lights.

Lastly, the mood lightling?  Please!  These are features that again, one can do without.  The mood lighting looks aftermarket and so chincy.  If you've never driven a car with it, you may jump onto the hype of wanting to buy a car with one.  But once you have it, the novelty wears of extremely quickly and then, you'd start to regret your decision into why you've bought this feature in the first place, and how you wished you'd just save the money.  Put it this way, mood lighting is as useless as the panoramic sunroof: both of which, you as a driver can never or will ever enjoy.

And this is my honest opion about Mercedes, whether you like it or not.","

67,"Positioning / design of side mirrors to reduce noise / improve efficiency is clever, but it is also a completely standard and universal consideration on any decent car. It is like saying it is clever the car has a steering wheel. ""Which does 0 - 62 in 5.6"", might be a quirky way to assume people know it means mph and seconds but is sloppy and shows wider ignorance, in my opinion. Especially when 'litres' is repeated twice in the same sentence. Someone looking to put three child seats in the back will want to know if it can be done for sure (what a car review could be useful for and mention rival models that achieve this) not what someone 'reckons'. The car selects 'perfect position' for height but in the clip it seems to challenge her reach - a bit ambiguous. 'It turns out the car can do what it is meant to do, it can actually go off road' is introduced through commentary on the infotainment system instead of when reviewing its engine/handling/ performance making it seem contrived to me. Personally, I don't have confidence in this presentation.","

39,"I recently got a Macan loaner from the dealership and got to drive it for 2.5 weeks. There are a few design flaws I found.
1. Seatbelt warning would not go away even when i buckled it up. It wasn't every time but I noticed it at least 7-10 times for the 2.5 weeks. I would say that's a lot. Maybe it is only to this specific vehicle. 
2. The footwell right to the accelerator is too close to the pedal. when I shift my right foot from brake to gas pedal, the front of my shoe always gets snagged by the foot well. On the same note, when I try to hit brake from gas pedal, my shoe also gets caught by the wall and I almost lost the timing to brake a couple of times. Very poor design. It may not be an issue if you use both feet to gas and brake but most don't. (I wrote this b4 watching his video but just finished watching his and he said something about it too. It's just that I didn't understand him cuz he mumbles under his breath when he talks about it. I get annoyed when he does that. It's hard for me to understand some of his brit accents :(). 
3. The brake has almost no play. Way too sensitive. Either you brake hard or you don't. I wonder if Cayenne of 2020 is also like that. My 911 and 2017 Cayenne aren't like that. 
Otherwise, you can expect same excellent drivability and handling from Porsche. I wasn't a big fan of gear ratio either but I didn't haul anything at that time so it may be ok with loading.","

The ""Basic"" Turbo version starts at 121'300CHF ( that is £101'000!). That is 47% more for the same thing. Talking about being ripped off.
In the US, this imported car that traveled all over the ocean, for them starts at 84'600USD ( £64'550) or 77'000CHF without taxes (83'200CHF would be with the VAT).","

Then whom the Macan is for at last, Maybe it's for me, since I could tell each of my rich friends using my keyboard that Macan is an awesome car to buy.","

304,"I miss a female touch to this channel. Today more than 50% of the women strongly influence the decision on which car to buy. This is especially true for the SUV market. Women want more practical cars, and they love beautiful cars and fast cars. Women do have money, a lot of money, and thus purchase power and decision power. I definitely loved this, when my wife bought me a gorgeous birthday present: a BMW M3 competition.

The porsche Macon is a great car as itis a suv spots car one may drive it fast one may drive is slow one may leave it to think about its day it doesn't note matter becuase itis a car who can handle it all. You have shown is a fast car that can go well and for that we thangyou. Remember here in my town of south africa we have these cars if you have money you can bye it otherwise if you have a gun or knife or stone you can just take one from another person who has one no problem. Your stink of truth is the best it tells us all thinks about cars i have a business idea for you misterWatson if you can make sticks and send them here to south africa i can sell them for you and we can make money great idea! That way we can tell people look when you are looking to buy or steal any car you can use the carwor stig of truth and choose your car. Personally i donut thing comparing a porseche macan to a bmw x3 because they are two difference cars. I did ressearch and bmw says look our car is a SAV and porsceh says look our car is a SUV so i donit thing this comparisone is correct bud look here one can always look to the other. Thanks again Mat WAatson i look to your videos every day a day without your voice and face is like dog who things heis a cat what will you do with it?

19,I'd have the Maserati all day long. Looks good. Should be a smaller wheel base though with coupe design and rapid movement front seats for easy rear access. Easy to do and would slow for a beautiful car instead of a car that's just a little too long. Did I mention it would have to be petrol or diesel though.  Don't want an electric heap of junk,"

100,"Pretty disappointed in the front end looks. Maserati’s usually have great front ends and the Levante is one of the best in the SUV class, but this one just looks off, and has the Macan style bug eye headlights but with worse proportions. The Alpha is still the best looking compact and I’d take the Macan over this for looks as well. The x4 is worse, but I’ve never been a fan of their designs. Would be interesting to see what it’s like in the interior/to drive. The Levante is a mixed bag inside, with some awesome leathers but also some mediocre plastics and electronics. If this can iron out those issues, it could be one of the better interiors. The Alpha is the most fun to drive in this class imo, even if the Macan is objectively a better handling vehicle. If this can replicate the Alpha but with more features and a better interior, it could be really great (despite the front end). Hard not to get a Porsche if you were actually buying one though, just for reliability.","

4,The first shipments and allocations for the 2022’s were actually the base cars. They sell way more lightly optioned base Macans than anything else. Given they know where their bread is buttered it isn’t hard at all to a get a lightly optioned one. Your tester actually has a lot of options. In fact that matte texture on the dash panel is leather and that is a fairly pricey upgrade over the standard Piano Black (though wood and Aluminium are now available at no extra cost),"

Not that they are unreliable, just expensive in every way to own.  With age comes wisdom...","

184,Rented a base macan over the summer. The engine felt very underpowered - almost dangerously slow in some cases. Agree that pretty much all the other 4 cyl competitors feel much more like responsive. My other issue with this car was the seat position and comfort - my back was killing me after about an hour. Really disliked this car - actually wished I had gone with the 530 rental that was also available.,"

And the engine is excellent, lots of pep and good acceleration, as you'd expect from nearly 300 lb-ft of torque...  People get obsessed with 400, 500, 600 hp, but seriously those levels of power are unnecessary for people if you don't drive on the Autobahn or on tracks; people tend to lose track of reality.  The base Macan is a seriously good car to drive, including at high speeds (very stable and planted).  I almost bought a Macan S, then decided that it really wasn't that much better than a base Macan to warrant the much-higher price -- after multiple test drives of both.  And the base gets way better gas mileage than does the S.","

329,"Porsche Macan...one of the most overrated and overpriced cars on the market.  Base model over $60k with tax and what do you get?  The last generation Audi platform, out of date infotainment system (No android auto!), cramped rear seats and less trunk space than most SUVs in its class.  Mediocre performance and a bare bones interior.  Other cars/SUVS costing far less, provide far more safety and other features as standard.  But being Porsche, if you want them  expect to pay hugely inflated prices. To get to the same standard of equipment as say, a Mazda CX 5 Signature, you'll be paying close to $80k...basically double the price of the Mazda.  Correction, you can't get to the CX5  level  of features even at that price, since Porsche doesn't offer heads up display on the Macan even as an option!  
BTW the CX5 is significantly faster from 0 to 60 and when I drove the Macan and the CX5 back to back I preferred the Mazda's  combination of ride and handling.  Maybe the Porsche will be better at the limit but be honest, how often do we ever get there?  If you want ""real"" Porsche performance you need to at least buy the Macan S and then you will be pushing $100K with the options that are standard on ""lesser"" cars.
And once you own the Porsche you are going to pay inflated prices for servicing.  But surely you get better quality?  Well, no.  Consumer Reports ranks Porsche 13th in reliability well behind Lexus and Mazda and even beaten by Chrysler. 
So basically you buy a Macan in the hope it impresses your friends...but they probably think your are a pretentious idiot for wasting that much money.","

8,"I don't know if you want detailed feedback on this new format or not but....

I liked her, good energy, good presentation style. Not yet jaded to lower spec cars from years of hyper performance vehicles etc. Overall I'd be happy with Alex as a new presenter ️ however, it did feel like the content was a bit dumbed down to what Rory's videos are, maybe more aimed at buyers who don't have a lot of auto knowledge? Eg the description of the wheels and brakes were very simplistic, Rory would normally state the tyre size and profile and the diameter of brakes etc etc. if you're planning to use Alex as for lower tier car marketing style videos, it'll work I reckon. But I assume most of us watch the performance car type videos WANTING to know the small details. And the lack of any specifics other than 'its good and it's fast' wouldn't cut it for me in future videos to be honest.","

Rory is good at presenting 'cos he's been at it for a long time. As far as I'm concerned Alex did a wonderful job and will get better with time. 
Reminds me of when Doug reviewed a car for the second time cos he felt the first time (which was years ago) he wasn't as thorough.

Rory?  He is in rare company.  Among other things, he knows he has a broad audience.  Not all have the means to purchase a McLaren or Bentley.  There are those who simply want an electric SUV that is suitable for young family.  These souls may want their daily to be a Lotus, but they most consider things like space for baby car seat and stroller. What does Rory do?  He reviews both.","

Absolutely nothing wrong with all that but why not take chance with a female Rory? Someone not posh, possibly even from an ethnic minority and with an individual style? Risky? Nah, not really. Look at how popular going against the grain with has worked out.

All the best of luck with Alex but you're giving us something we already have in abundance on other shows/channels. Vicky Butler Henderson gave us what your new presenter does more than a decade ago","

130,"You need to test this car on Scottish roads. I have a Macan S and it handles like a pig on a waterbed on the roads in Perthshire. It's like driving a bouncy castle and when you put it in Sport mode it feels like the tyres are made of concrete. Porsche cannot have  developed this car properly for it to drive this way. The steering is devoid of feedback or feel. It's not quite the worst car I've driven (that was my dad's Morris Marina) but by a long way it's the worst Porsche I've had. I cannot see how making if faster would help as I have to drive it well below the speed limit just to avoid getting sea sick. My BMW 530 was way better on the same roads and my wife's Mini Cooper would leave it for dead. Save your money. Don't buy one. And it rattles non stop, which Porsche cannot fix. Pile of poo.","

Even a new M340i can do under 4 seconds. The range topping Macan is comparable to the 43 and M40i level of performance, whereas it should be competing with the 63 and full M level cars.

I get that it’s about the drive, but at that price point you would except it to be competitive with current tech. You don’t even get ambient lights or a head up display.","

Of course, after the very unsuccessful TG they moved onto a string of other failures.

Quiz Show hosts (primarily) and ex-cricketers and mindfulness coaches now abound. That’s why Top Gear and the rest is so better than before.

256,"She made a pretty bad first impression on me. The first thing she does is disrespect rory, the person that made this channel succesfull, i know it is meant as a joke but it comes across as very condescending. She tells him that she is better and a professional and the tone of her voice in that conversation seems to show her extreme drive to be succesfull wherever she works. I can tell she dislikes being new on the channel because of her passive agression when rory said it was his channel. She seems to get triggered and started telling him she was better than him. Even pushed him trying to show she is not afraid. 

I think there are others ways to do your first impression, like respect rory and be thankfull for the opportunity the channel gives you. Just be respectfull and kind to a person every viewer likes. Give the audience some time to get to know your soft side. Later in the relastionship between rory and alex she can show a bit of teasing. And that teasing can develop into a fun communicationstyle between the two. 

Something else I noticed was that from the moment the camera was on her alone in the car, she suddenly calmes down and tries to be sweet and kind. 
I think i already know what she is all about. A very competitive woman who wants to show how great she is because deep down it frustrates her she works in a men industry. Ofcourse, i cant be sure. But i have this feeling because of her first impression. i hope i judged her character wrong.","

But, the rear is debatably and improvement over the original sculpted tail lights and the front end is definitely less sporty.

Green Peoples Party gave order to shorten fuel supply from 2025 on by 
reducing all conventional fuel stations to only one state operated 
central gas station per city or county. Now they even want to slow down 
all the gas pumps from 20 litre per minute to 2 litre per minute...From 
2027 on in the EU certain car spare parts will be banned too....as 
exhaust systems, turbo chargers and even some engine and gearbox 
oils...California and New York will do the same from 2027 on.... So no 
investments should be done in oil burning cars any longer....They even

There is no passion In her review (facial expressions and emotion, sure, but not true passion). No meaning to her words. She's a tv presenter, yogi, coach, psychotherapist. An impressive career and life. 

BUT NOT a fit for car reviews

I hope you don't go down this road and ruin this channel.","

I remember when I used to pick-up the free auto-trader, and wheeler dealer magazines from the gas stations.
