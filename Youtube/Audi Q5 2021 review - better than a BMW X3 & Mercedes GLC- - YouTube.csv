2,"I shortlisted the 2021 GLB,GLC,X3 and Q5. Took all of them out for a lengthy test (some received 3 test drives) The driving experience is overrated with the X3 in my opinion. I was shocked because all the reviews speak to its sportiness and better driver engagement. To be completely honest I much preferred  the Q5 driving experience much more. The Q5 has the identity of would I expect a “luxury family” SUV to be. It was plush, quiet, comfortable and had more than enough power in all situations. The others felt a bit harsh compared to it. Maybe my expectations are different than the other reviewers.","

6,"Nice review. 32 MPG equals 7.35 L/100 km. Which is actually awesome for a car like this with powerful tubro-4. Given that the modern diesel motors are cut in power due to environment regulations, for most people I guess 2.0T would be the most adequate choice if you average 20-25 thousand KM per year. If you do more than 50 thousand km, then the economy from diesel will be more substantial. However I doubt it is very important in 50-60k USD car.","

But in reality a lot customers are actually choosing between both. And although the EVs are on paper miles more expensive, when you boil it down to a monthly total cost that gap closes a lot (especially for a company car).","

13,"Had the petrol one of these on test recently, which is NOT the one to buy. Lack of lowdown power and the ride was too firm as you need Air suspension and only gets 30 mpg on a run. So unless you can get a big discount, the diesels are the ones to go for as the engine suits the car a lot better and has better fuel economy over the petrol. The car is still very spec sensitive, with black alloy wheels to be avoided, plus arguably not as good looking at versions of a few years back too.","

All in all they could have updated the dash more snd not had those small cube holes. Even my pre facelift has the thin slot and tiny space at the front from which items fly out!

As well as a lot of the older folks still have Iphone 5's and 6's so they fir nicely in those smaller areas. I understand for the EU market it might be weird but the EU cars are sold almost as is in the African market so I guess that is why they keep some of these smaller things.

4. Mat’s showing off drifting constantly when no need.
5. The same old tired format of reviewing the car, please change it up a little.

At times, He is profaned by those who claim to follow Him but do not act in His will. They do evil and say it is His will when it is not. God will not let His name remain profaned. He will make unbelievers know that He is God and that He is good. Maybe you know someone who drags God’s name through the mud. That can be frustrating and even infuriating to watch. Take heart. God is mightier than them. He will make Himself known. /prayer+ LORD, You are mighty and good. You will make Your character known. Show Your might to the nations. Make unbelievers tremble at the knowledge of You. Show them You are God. You have the power to do anything. Let Your will be done. Let men bow before You and know that You are God.

Stay away from quattro system, Canadians. It's not a full time AWD car anymore.","
