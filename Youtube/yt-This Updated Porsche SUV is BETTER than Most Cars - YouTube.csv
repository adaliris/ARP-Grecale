4,The first shipments and allocations for the 2022’s were actually the base cars. They sell way more lightly optioned base Macans than anything else. Given they know where their bread is buttered it isn’t hard at all to a get a lightly optioned one. Your tester actually has a lot of options. In fact that matte texture on the dash panel is leather and that is a fairly pricey upgrade over the standard Piano Black (though wood and Aluminium are now available at no extra cost),"

And the engine is excellent, lots of pep and good acceleration, as you'd expect from nearly 300 lb-ft of torque...  People get obsessed with 400, 500, 600 hp, but seriously those levels of power are unnecessary for people if you don't drive on the Autobahn or on tracks; people tend to lose track of reality.  The base Macan is a seriously good car to drive, including at high speeds (very stable and planted).  I almost bought a Macan S, then decided that it really wasn't that much better than a base Macan to warrant the much-higher price -- after multiple test drives of both.  And the base gets way better gas mileage than does the S.","

329,"Porsche Macan...one of the most overrated and overpriced cars on the market.  Base model over $60k with tax and what do you get?  The last generation Audi platform, out of date infotainment system (No android auto!), cramped rear seats and less trunk space than most SUVs in its class.  Mediocre performance and a bare bones interior.  Other cars/SUVS costing far less, provide far more safety and other features as standard.  But being Porsche, if you want them  expect to pay hugely inflated prices. To get to the same standard of equipment as say, a Mazda CX 5 Signature, you'll be paying close to $80k...basically double the price of the Mazda.  Correction, you can't get to the CX5  level  of features even at that price, since Porsche doesn't offer heads up display on the Macan even as an option!  
BTW the CX5 is significantly faster from 0 to 60 and when I drove the Macan and the CX5 back to back I preferred the Mazda's  combination of ride and handling.  Maybe the Porsche will be better at the limit but be honest, how often do we ever get there?  If you want ""real"" Porsche performance you need to at least buy the Macan S and then you will be pushing $100K with the options that are standard on ""lesser"" cars.
And once you own the Porsche you are going to pay inflated prices for servicing.  But surely you get better quality?  Well, no.  Consumer Reports ranks Porsche 13th in reliability well behind Lexus and Mazda and even beaten by Chrysler. 
So basically you buy a Macan in the hope it impresses your friends...but they probably think your are a pretentious idiot for wasting that much money.","
