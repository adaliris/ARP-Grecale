10,"I like this car! Over the years I have found that BMW interior materials tend to mark, wrinkle and break down much sooner than similar M-B materials (especially BMW's thin/crappy seat upholstery and carpets). These items are always made better in Mercedes Benz autos. BMW durability is plainly lacking, even though when brand new things might feel a bit softer. Actually they are just that much easier to blemish and show wear. I believe this M-B GLC has no equal in this size/price range. It will likely last quite a bit longer, cost less to maintain, and gives you that Three Pointed Star CURB APPEAL that all BMW's lack. Propeller emblem? - A joke by comparison.","

25,"I am 6’5” and have really enjoyed my 2017 AMG 43. Unfortunately, I have very little legroom left with my seat position and cannot fit baby seats or carry adults behind me. Suggest switching out the brake pads for ceramics immediately after brake pad light comes on.  You can avoid replacing the expensive rotors. The ceramic pads have very little brake dust. I have switched my service away from MB now that I am out of warranty and have saved a ton of cost. I would highly recommend as a used car if you have a non-MB mechanic available.","

40,Matt only appears to like Porche and Bmw at the moment. He recommends the Porche Macan. A car that is at the top of the most unreliable cars list for the extended warranties survey in the UK. I am sure loads of people own them and have no problems. Many people have tech and electrical issues with these cars as many other German Suvs made by Audi and BMW. If Mercedes bring out a fast Amg perhaps they can race it against a 10000 bhp dragster that does 3.9 seconds on the quarter and say it is slow.,"

Я очень сильно устал от войны.
Мы Украинци   очень благодарны Вам Англичанам за помощь которую Вы нам оказываете.
Теперь немного по теме.
Я смотрю Ваши видео как фантастические фильмы.Честным путем в Украине заработать на такой автомобиль  практически не возможно.Только у политиков и их детей.Примерно  85% Украинцев ездят на старых авто.,которые  в Польше или в Германии ездили уже лет 10.Потом эти авто попадают в Украину и тут еще  лет  10 ездят.И все берегут эти старые авто,потому что новое авто не купишь.И это не потому что люди ленивые и не хотят честно работать.Наше правительство нас постоянно обворовывало.За последние 30 лет только теперь в Украинцев сильный,умный и честный президент-Зеленский.
Ты можешь себе представить что-бы в 21 веке  работающей семье  было трудно отремонтировать автомобиль 1980 года выпуска?!
Я иногда вижу по телевизору шоу в которых  ради забавы разбивают авто.У меня слезы  появляются на глазах от мысли что на той хоть и старой машине можна зделать  много полезных дел для семьи.
Не хочу говорить о грусном.Мэт ты хороший и веселый и умный парень.Снимай дальше свои хорошие видео.Это помогает мне немного отвлечься от войны.

Plus seat adjustment buttons have no longer any motion/feedback, just feel glued to the door (with touch sensors) - just feels wrong. Huge downgrades. Plus despite it's spacious look on the outside it's very small inside - smallest comparing to X3 and Q5. At the back people with 6 foot plus hit the ceiling with head.","

Matt could have gotten a vehicle that was spec'd out with contrast color interiors. For example, this vehicle would have looked sublime in light/beige/white color interior given that the exterior is dark colored. That way, we know what the vehicle is actually capable of bringing to the table, instead of reviewing the vehicle on its bad day and not knowing it's full potential. It's not really minor even though it may seem like.","

Just look how bad the seat and sunroof controls are compared to the predecessor. Also the lower door trim was made of soft materials, now it's cheap hard plastic. And it's way more expensive now.","
