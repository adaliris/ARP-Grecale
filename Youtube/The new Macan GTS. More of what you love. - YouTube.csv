4,"I just configured one fully loaded....$115k. I wish it had nice interior multi color ambient lighting (doesn't have to be at the crazy level of MB or Audi, but something sweet and subtle). I wish there were the option for the deviated stitching to be yellow, and yellow seatbelts to go with the yellow calipers on the ceramic breaks. Or to have green stitching and belts to match the green exterior color option.","
