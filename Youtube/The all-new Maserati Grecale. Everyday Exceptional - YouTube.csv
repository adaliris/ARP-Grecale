4,"my opinion doesn't count, but to me it is a massive downgrade compared to the levante (especially in the front end).
where it got better are just the interior probably.
they made a maserati look like a jaguar e-pace, and it is not a a good thing at all.","

Moreover, luxury meant the finest materials, craftsmanship, and comfort (or sportiness depending on your taste). So Maserati, looking for that sporty luxury car from you because you‚Äôre not as invested in as the rest‚Ä¶ and a Maserati was and still is the definition of sporty luxury.","
