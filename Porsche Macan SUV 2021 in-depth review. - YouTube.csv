39,"I recently got a Macan loaner from the dealership and got to drive it for 2.5 weeks. There are a few design flaws I found.
1. Seatbelt warning would not go away even when i buckled it up. It wasn't every time but I noticed it at least 7-10 times for the 2.5 weeks. I would say that's a lot. Maybe it is only to this specific vehicle. 
2. The footwell right to the accelerator is too close to the pedal. when I shift my right foot from brake to gas pedal, the front of my shoe always gets snagged by the foot well. On the same note, when I try to hit brake from gas pedal, my shoe also gets caught by the wall and I almost lost the timing to brake a couple of times. Very poor design. It may not be an issue if you use both feet to gas and brake but most don't. (I wrote this b4 watching his video but just finished watching his and he said something about it too. It's just that I didn't understand him cuz he mumbles under his breath when he talks about it. I get annoyed when he does that. It's hard for me to understand some of his brit accents :(). 
3. The brake has almost no play. Way too sensitive. Either you brake hard or you don't. I wonder if Cayenne of 2020 is also like that. My 911 and 2017 Cayenne aren't like that. 
Otherwise, you can expect same excellent drivability and handling from Porsche. I wasn't a big fan of gear ratio either but I didn't haul anything at that time so it may be ok with loading.","

I basically wasted almost the same amount of money as the macan turbo, a lot more HP(well over 600) and i also payed for it straight Cash, no financing, so my insurance won't own it.

530,Thangs hey misterMat. You have pushed blessings to the max now. Alride let's get two it. The truth is wow what a nice car yes. The porsche Macon is a great car as itis a suv spots car one may drive it fast one may drive is slow one may leave it to think about its day it doesn't note matter becuase itis a car who can handle it all. You have shown is a fast car that can go well and for that we thangyou. Remember here in my town of south africa we have these cars if you have money you can bye it otherwise if you have a gun or knife or stone you can just take one from another person who has one no problem. Your stink of truth is the best it tells us all thinks about cars i have a business idea for you misterWatson if you can make sticks and send them here to south africa i can sell them for you and we can make money great idea! That way we can tell people look when you are looking to buy or steal any car you can use the carwor stig of truth and choose your car. Personally i donut thing comparing a porseche macan to a bmw x3 because they are two difference cars. I did ressearch and bmw says look our car is a SAV and porsceh says look our car is a SUV so i donit thing this comparisone is correct bud look here one can always look to the other. Thanks again Mat WAatson i look to your videos every day a day without your voice and face is like dog who things heis a cat what will you do with it? Great shorts pant and beautiful smile im glad you consider me your friend. Blessings unto thee.,"
