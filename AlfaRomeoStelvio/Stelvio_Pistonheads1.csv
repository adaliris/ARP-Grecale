The proportions look right to me and so much better than the default white goods that usually define this class of SUV.It also looks as if a Giulia sportwagon isn't going to happen now so this could be the only option if you need to transport a 5 person family in an Alfa.

Guvernator,"I can think of 3 advantages of an SUV over an estate off the top of my head.1) Better visibility. The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.

Dale487,I think the pricing is going to be key to its success - the petrol needs to be £35-37.5K in my opinion to have enough clear air between it and the 4 cylinder Macan and the diesel needs to still under cut the base Macan. ,"February 28, 2017"
Kitchski,"Guvernator said:I'm not a fan of SUV's either but for the purposes of getting an average family from A to B they really are one of the best options due to stuff already stated above, well it's either that or an MPV! So all the scorn on PH, either the majority of PH'ers are rich bachelor singletons or powerfully built company directors who pack the kids off to boarding school or let the nanny kart the kids around so don't have to worry about the practicalities of moving kids around.The SUV is still no-where near as good as an MPV at carting the brood around. You'd struggle to get three decent kids car seats across the back of that, so unless you've got two kids or less, you'd still be better off in an MPV. And if you've got two kids or less, a normal saloon or estate would do the job fine. We've only got an S-Max because one of our kids split into two before they were born, the cheeky feckers.Some people who care too much how others perceive them might insist on trying to cram everything into a tool less-suited to the job, but the MPV is just made for families, pure and simple.

I'm not prepared to sacrifice the lower COG, reduced weight, increased performance and efficiency, better handling and in many cases better refinement that an estate offers over its SUV equivalent in order to get a high seating position and marginally easier access, but I can understand why some people would. nickfrog said: TurboHatchback said: nickfrog said: wemorgan said: TurboHatchback said: ","February 28, 2017"

For family transport at 3/10ths, the added lat grip and sharper handling afforded by a lower COG would be of zero impact in the real world of real facts based on real science. Our Tiguan is actually a surprisingly good handler despite the high COG, I blame the quality kinematics and tyres for that. Performance of the 2.0 TDI 150 is ample : on the road I find that the limiting factors are line of sight, traffic and licence preservation. Granted, MPG is probably 5mpg worse than an equivalent estate.

I personally don't see the advantages of an SUV over a normal estate car. You obviously do. We can leave it there, it doesn't need elaboratingNot trying to convince you. You can't see the benefits compared to an estate - I can't see ANY benefits that an estate would have compared to an SUV. But remember you're the one elaborating with a bizarre collection of obsolete clichés at 14.00, so I am quite happy to leave it there.Without wanting to inflame this debate any further, I know we are now living in a new world of 'Alternative Facts' and it may be true to say that you cant see any benefits of an SUV over an Estate. However, in the real world of real facts with their basis in real science, surely you cannot dispute that (in relation to a similarly powered and priced SUV alternative) an estate would:be lighter,have a lower COG,have better performancebe more aerodynamicgive better economybe dynamically superior as a result of the above.Unless you don't see any of these things as benefits?Fair comments but I take the Megane RS for track days or spirited driving, that's my alternative fact for you. For family transport at 3/10ths, the added lat grip and sharper handling afforded by a lower COG would be of zero impact in the real world of real facts based on real science. Our Tiguan is actually a surprisingly good handler despite the high COG, I blame the quality kinematics and tyres for that. Performance of the 2.0 TDI 150 is ample : on the road I find that the limiting factors are line of sight, traffic and licence preservation. Granted, MPG is probably 5mpg worse than an equivalent estate. But then again superior residuals more than offset that.So zero real world downsides and loads of real world benefits (comfy ride, easier access, better visibility, smaller physical footprint). For family use, the choice is simple, despite the ghastly image and the PH scienceEdited by nickfrog on Tuesday 28th February 17:33This is pretty much spot on in my view.There is so much hate for the idea of an SUV, especially an Alfa one, but the reality is some of them do a pretty decent job of being a jack of all trades, and get surprisingly close to being a master of some.I moved from an Alfa Giulietta to a Skoda Yeti (4x4 170 bhp) as a practical car the Yeti is in a different class to the Giulietta, as a car to have fun in on the back road it is almost as good too, what it looses in not being being quite as stable, it gains in providing a better sight line for corners, with its higher driving position. Then you add in the other advantages, much more room for a dog, tow capacity which is genuinely useful, ground clearance to take it down unclassified tracks across the moors, four wheel drive to make that less of a worry.I do miss the style of the Alfa and if I'm being badge conscious I miss owning a modern everyday Alfa, so the Stelvio makes a lot of sense in my world. Mind you what I do have to consider Is the fact it will cost half as much again as the Skoda!. nickfrog said: Motormatt said: nickfrog said: Kitchski said: Edited by nickfrog on Tuesday 28th February 17:33 ","February 28, 2017"

Evilex,"nickfrog said:The thought process is simple. They tend to be a better functional alternative for transport than traditional estates or saloons for many people. They're slightly shorter than an ""equivalent"" estate yet offer similar interior space ; they offer a higher driving position which is brilliant for visibility, touring, ease of access. They tend to have taller sidewalls and longer travel suspension which is a good combo for comfort.They are dynamically superb despite the high COG but won't quite match a lower car, which is no big deal as they're not track cars. They use a little more fuel which is offset by better residuals. No downsides IME. I am sure they are also bought for fashion but that shouldn't come into it objectively ; many buy them despite the image as they don't really care about what others think.Er... have you not just almost described a Fiat Multipla? nickfrog said: ","February 28, 2017"

The higher driving position lets you see over other traffic and better judge the corners of the car, especially since the largely female target demographic are shorter on average. My missus rates this as one of the most important advantages of an SUV.2) Easier to get small kids in and out of the back and shopping in an out of the boot. Both my missus and I have suffered from back issues from having to stick heavy toddlers in the back seat. This problem is greatly reduced in an SUV as you are at the right height to plop them straight even rather than bending over.3) Ride comfort, the bigger tires and larger suspension travel often mean they have a comfier ride, much more important in a family wagon then whether it will corner on it's mirrors. Also the urban suv's might not be so great at going off-road but they are certainly capable enough to handle our pot whole ridden, crap roads and better than a long, low estate.4. 4WD with no transmission tunnel.OK, only the X5 , Discovery and Range Rovers do this .. but gives loads more interior space Guvernator said: ","March 01, 2017"

Good thing I don't need a compact people carrier at the moment, or I would be moaning about the lack of a B-Max ST, Scenic RS or Sportsvan GTI/GTD .I agree with you - they fixed the SUV to make it as good as the ""monospace"" while still resembling a pseudo off-roader - they got there in the end by using hatch underpinnings but that's a strange way indeed to re-invent the wheel without making it too square !Amusingly the MPVs are now trying to look like SUVs - cue the new Scenic which is as high as Kadjar but ONLY comes with 20' wheels when the Kadjar can be bought with 17's!!

thegreenhell,"big_rob_sydney said:Matt Bird said:Sorry! Stelvio is 4680mm long, 1670mm high and 2160mm wide. X3 is 4657/1678/1881 (suspect width is without mirrors here) and F-Pace is 4731/1667/1936 (again I think without mirrors). Alfa made no mention of hybrids at all and has clearly invested a lot in the diesel here, with a focus still on it. That there will be a 180hp version with two-wheel drive in time suggests that will be pitched as the eco version.MattBloody hell, 2160mm wide!?!How on earth will these things fit into the typical shoebox that is a british garage???More to the point, how will they fit in a standard sized parking spot? And what of doors getting dinged by other people needing to access their own cars before you come along and creep into their space due to your own leviathan proportions...?I get that its light compared to some others, but it does seem to be quite wide.I've seen it listed elsewhere as 1903mm (excluding mirrors), which puts puts it midway between X3 and F-Pace width.I don't know why Alfa have taken to quoting width including mirrors (although that figure obviously has its uses) when nobody else does. They did it with the 4C, and everyone slated it for being wider than an Aventador when in reality it wasn't when measured in the same way. big_rob_sydney said: Matt Bird said: ","March 03, 2017"

I think I get around 27mpg overall but I don't imagine the Stelvio will reach that with the 4x4 drivetrain being dragged around - but could be wrong.Also, bear in mind the pretty short 9000 mile (or annual) l service intervals which add to the overall cost. And also, trying to find a decent dealer for aftersales care is no mean feat.If you'd like to know anything more specific, just let me know.Thanks for your reply, food for thought.

aspender,"Practicality:Boot is a very reasonable size, nice and square and with no loading lip. We can pretty much everything we need for a 5-day trip to center parcs into it (e.g. buggy, large suitcase, trunki, then stuff packed around them. Back seats are fine for car seats and the isofix points are very well done (small plastic flap to lift up, no hunting around to find them) rear space isn't amazing. I have the drivers seat fairly far back and there's still room for an adult behind me, but it isn't expansive. Headroom in the back is fine. I have the pano sunroof which makes it quite airy back there too. However without pano, with privacy glass and the swooping line of the roof I can image that it might feel a bit more claustrophobic than it actually is. There are two USB charging points for the back seats but they don't connect to the infotainment.In the front things are all good. Seats (Milano Edizione ones) are good and well adjustable with memory. A nice touch is if the drivers seat is set forward of the B pillar it will automatically move back to allow easy ingress/egress when the engine is switched off. There's USB on the center console and in the glovebox. I have a mini-USB stick of the daughters music in the glovebox permanently attached and still use the console one for charging my phone. The climate control feeds directly into the glovebox but tbh I've never found a use for this. Two good cupholders (concealable) in the centre console along with a useful phone slot between them. Glovebox is very small. Door storage is fine.We cycle a lot. I didn't spec the roof rails but do have Whispbar roof bars and a couple of bike carriers which fit fine and actually look pretty good. It's not such a high car that getting bikes on/off the top is too difficult.Driving:All very subjective... but for an SUV it is definitely fast enough! If you want to drive it spiritedly it will play ball. Of course if really pushed then the laws of physics come into play, it is still a high vehicle with a bit more weight, but overally the reviews rightly laud the drive dynamics. Steering is fast but I've not found that it is too fidgety like some reviews say. Conversely when you just want to get from A-B the car is just a nice place to trundle along in. The gearbox never misses a beat in full auto mode. DNA selector is 95% of the time in 'N' for me with occassional 'D' and never 'A' unless there's snow. There is a marked difference in throttle responsiveness and gear selection between 'N' and 'D' but for everyday driving with 'N' you can just downshift with the paddles to execute an overtake etc. Engine noise is what you might expect from a 4-pot turbo but after a while it has got a bit more tuneful.MPG is... well thirsty. In 12k miles I've averaged around 24mpg. A long motorway drive might get 30 or so.Other stuff:Had a few niggles covered by warranty - filler cap tends to warp and stick out a bit. Alarm can be over-sensitive and needs adjusting. I've only had one significant mechanical that required the ABS pump to be replaced. AEB can be a bit over-keen in warning you of impending doom e.g. when turning near oncoming traffic (but doesn't kick in)Mostly though, it is still a very unusual car to see around and 18 months in I still get a kick every time I look at it or drive it ","April 28, 2019"

Yes the infotainment is better (the performance pages are actually quite useful) the driver assistance stuff works well etc, but fundamentally it's the same overall driving and cabin experience and the mechanicals are not really much different (on the Stelvio QF there are engine changes, notably the introduction of both direct and port injection to avoid the need for a GPF. There's also a rumour of a 1.5cm lower ride height)If you can get second hand with Carplay/Android Auto, I'd say that would be a great car regardless.

Bencolem,Surprised no-ones talked weight… this is a quarter of a tonne lighter than the X3 M40i it’s being compared to in the comments. ,"May 14, 2023"

If you compare four- with four- the difference seems to be about 100, maybe 150kg, which is still significant but a bit more sensible! Bencolem said: ","May 14, 2023"

Neither being great but the quadrifoglio can be forgiven for having a nice sound and sooooo much power.I'm taking an X3 M40i out tomorrow to do the same route and having owned a 40i engined BMW before I'm expecting the X3 to easily top 30mpg if not 35mpg despite being 250kg heavier. It's also got a lot more tech.I've pretty much written off the Stelvio already, the ride was very crashy and seats aside (they were very comfortable) I didn't get on with the interior.

The others have a slight needy image to them where the Stelvio stands alone and says “fk it, I don’t care what others think of my car choice”. ","May 15, 2023"

It was also a better ride than the Alfa which surprised me!. QuattroDave said: RonnieHotdogs said: kambites said: ","May 15, 2023"
