arbit,"Hi,I am looking to replace my current BMW E92 330i by a X3 M40i due to the arrival of a baby and as I’d also like a more comfortable ride.Is there anything you would advise me to particularly look out for in a used x3 M40i? I was looking for sth from 2018 or newer with no more than 20k miles. Probably best for peace of mind to go for a sale from a BMW approved dealer so that I get their warranty? Used prices seem to be usually around £38k.An extra that is absolutely necessary is the adaptive suspension is my understanding. Is there anything else you’d recommend? I think what would be nice are HUD, Harmann Kardon sounds system and wireless charging.Thanks for your help! ","March 27, 2021"
RBrown,"Hi. I have March 2018 X3 M40i. It was one of the first in UK.I love it - it is a great family wagon and gives you huge smiles!In terms of extras. Definitely go for adaptive suspension- the ride on 20 inch wheels is very comfortable. In terms of other extras I have - H&K speakers, tinted rear glass, acoustic glass (great extra!), folding side mirrors, lumbar support and space saver wheel (so as you can drive on non RFTs knowing you have a spare!).In terms of warranty - I have just taken out BMW approved extended warranty at £500 for year. As this includes roadside assistance, it gives you peace of mind and I think it’s worth it.I’m based in Glasgow and second hand supply seems low. I have had a few dealers trying to get my car. I may be looking to sell my car soon, so let me know if you need more info. I would be looking for less than £38k! My car has 19.5k miles. It is immaculate as I really look after my cars - and don’t let kids eat in the car! I’ve attached a photo - please let me know if you need any more info the M40i.

RBrown,My wife has previous generation (F25) X3 20d. She far prefers the M40i. It’s a much smoother ride and bumbles about fine and if you want to extend your right ankle...the power comes through and the smiles start!!!I should have said that I got mine debadged. Far prefer the sleeper look!!! ,"March 27, 2021"
Cobnapint,"I'm amazed (and pleased) to hear the ride is smooth with 20s on the M40i. I was lead to believe the ride was firmish with the normal M Sport suspension, and firmer still on the M40i & D. ","March 29, 2021"

Paw,"I have a 68 plate (so less pops and crackles) M40i and its a great car, its on 20's with std suspension so its firm but it does handle.I would say that the Pan Roof is a must it gives so much light into the car. I did not go for HDC (but it was a used car) as I could not see it with sunglasses on, but I agree on the HK as the sound quality is not super.My wife was a little scared of it at first, due to coming a diesel but now loves it.Paw ","April 09, 2021"
Cobnapint,"Just for interest, I took a 30d M-Sport out today, on non-run flat 20s with adaptive and the ride was better than my Cayenne on 21s with air suspension. Very impressed, apart from the fact I couldn't get comfy in the driver's seat. ","April 15, 2021"

They are about but hard to come by if you are picky on spec - Cardiff would not budge on a 69 plate 8k miles older model at £44k, got this up country for £41k with higher 17k miles on it.

It works for me as I realised M cars aren’t special enough for ‘high day and holiday’ cars and are best being used for the daily grind in an entirely unromantic way. I like the boot space, ground clearance, 4wd and it’s fast, comfortable and utterly anonymous. Not much more than that. I hope the newer one has the torque curve improved, but that’s about it.

cerb4.5lee,"I've always liked these and the X5M, but for some reason I always feel that an SUV suits a diesel engine better. I think that ultimate performance is better suited to lighter and lower cars than an SUV arguably. ","April 15, 2022"
Flat-Patch,"I own a 21 plate, pre-LCI facelift. In summary, they're a fantastic bit of kit, but with two serious flaws, namely the firm suspension and lack of exhaust note. The latter is easily remedied, with a Remus or Akrapovic back box or system, but they start at £3k! The firm suspension is something you live with, and has got better since fitting Michelin PS4's (the OEM Conti's are garbage). The engine, box and build quality though, go some way to justify the price. They're bloody quick, stop well, handle fine (considering the mass), easily consume a family and furry friends, and not that common. Oh and until very recently, you could also get them on 2.9% APR PCP's, making them significantly cheaper on a monthly basis, than some of their direct rivals. ","April 15, 2022"

My personal viewpoint is that BMW have already missed the boat by taking ages to actually bring the M3 Touring to the market. However it is good to have the choice though I think.I think that I'd go for the M3 Touring over this(I liked the E61 520d Touring I had apart from the crappy 4 cylinder engine it had under the bonnet), but my missus definitely wouldn't because she thinks that estates are seriously uncool.

And there's no view as to whether it's any better than rivals (apart from the F-Pace SVR), but having owned a few JLR products, I'm never going back there. Terrible quality and generally shocking service.Also, having just bought one and having owned an X3 M40i before it, I would say that this is a superior car to the X3 M40i - yes it's quicker (a LOT quicker) but it also handles better, makes less road noise on bad surfaces and although people complain about it having a firm ride, I've no idea what they are talking about - the ride is absolutely fine. The GLC 63 AMG S i drove a few years ago had a far worse ride (but did sound epic). I notice that the test car had Continental Sport Contact tyres, mine has the Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S, not sure if that makes a difference or not? But mine both handles and rides really well.I did like the creamy smoothness of the X3 M40i but this car sounds fine too! Better than the Macan Turbo I drove but sure not as good as the GLC 63 AMG S. It doesn't handle as well as the Porsche but it's not a million miles off and I paid nothing like £90k for mine (and wouldn't have).

I want a V8 because I really, really like the noise they make (I’ve not been without one for nearly 20 years now). I also want something really fking fast that can also do comfortable at the twist of a dial. So we’ve now got an F-Pace SVR because it’s one of a handful of cars that meet our requirements. It’s most definitely not for ‘willy waving’ - not that you’ll believe that, obviously.As for the X3M having too much power; well it’s less than 300bhp per ton, I’d say it’s a bit short but obviously others will disagree.The X3M, while not for me, will fit the requirements for many people out there.

It seems it’s a fairly mediocre M car and the market agrees, if they depreciate that much in “this” market….On the 69 plate ones they did have a very big discount so actual price paid would be more like £65k. Even on my 21 plate X3m comp i got a £17.5k dealer contribution.For me its a perfect one car does all. Its very fast, lots of space and not super expensive to run as insurance was like £700, full tank about £90-£110 and only do about 5k miles a year.I would be tempted by an LCI in the future as an M3 touring will be £900-£1k a month car even with a big deposit where my x3m is about £500pm.Edited by WY86 on Friday 15th April 12:54Unfortunately, those days are gone. Speaking to my BMW dealer on and off over the last few months, the days of big discounts and low interest rates are over and won’t be returning for a long time. That doesn’t just apply to M3s, it applies to M5s and even 550is. Even a heavily optioned M340d Touring (admittedly zero deposit) is c. £900 p/m. I’m pretty sure if you got a quote for an X3M, it wouldn’t be much less than an M3.If it is, then I need to find a new dealer!!

GrantD5,"How's it going people? It's been a while since I have posted on here.Some may know, I was doing Uber driving and I have a VW Jetta for that but through lockdown I stopped and the car went to my Mum as I barely used it! Anyway I had a moped and I was doing Uber Eats etc for a while in London and it has been 1 year already. The bike sold yesterday and it was time to get another car. I will be going back to Uber very soon just waiting on TFL to pull their finger out of their backsides.Anyway, I sold the Ford Transit as I just had no use or the van anymore, just as the van was in a perfect working state ha.Today I drove 90 miles to Kettering and purchased this! 2004 BMW X3 3.0 Petrol 4 Wheel Drive. Pulled out the iPhone for some photos! Nice foggy day.While browsing on and off recently I noticed the market for the 6 cylinder autos tended to be 2.5i 4wd and 3.0i rear wheel drive. I had a 3.0i RWD lined up to go and see and I had one last look before leaving today and found this! I'm not sure how common the the 3.0i 4WD are but I never really noticed many and I was debating between going for the 4wd and slower or RWD and faster. But this is the best of both.Anyway the car drove faultlessly, but the EML came on - quick phone call with the home dealer and had the explanation of plugs and coils changed recently and the EML comes on sometimes??? So some digging in to that needed but the car was driving fine so I wasn't to phased. Also the airbag light come on as I pulled up at home, assuming its the occupancy sensor similar to E46 niggles.But apart from the the remote locking works, on one key at least think one may need a battery. All windows go up & down, the displays all work and are not pixelated, it has the locking nut, it has MOT, it has some history and it seems to just work. It has a CD player stereo and 6CD changer in the arm rest but it needs to go. I'd like a screen set up in the dashboard cubbyhole like on some models.My only pain with the 4WD was wanting to get the X5 wheels that I had on the X1 also but the rears are wider so far as I know that's no good for 4WD and need a square set up?Not sure what the overall plans are just nice to be in a nice enough daily car that's going to kill the wallet on petrol. At least it is ULEZ compliant and I can drive in the the zone without being charged an arm and a leg.Any advice / heads up please let me know! I know it's not the most exciting car but I have had an itch for one for a while now but while wanting X5 wheels. So I have to figure that now.

So got to scanning and it flashed up the following.And one extra screen I found that I don't really understand, if anyone can shed some light that would be great.Moving on, I have been reading some 330i / 530i threads online and it seems a common replacement for the M54 engines can be the DISA valve.Here is a copy and paste of some issues that can arise when yours is faulty (for those that might not know)"" The symptoms of this fault are very obvious; there is a rattling noise coming from the DISA valve, SES light is lit and getting a lean mixture fault or rough running at idle. Displaying DTC codes and a loss in low end torque. There may be a rattling, buzzing or clicking noise coming from the engine. Fault codes: lean condition(P1083, P1085), front oxygen sensor lean (P1090, P1092) oxygen sensor slow response (P1087, P1089) and cylinder misfire (P0311-P0316) fuel control mixture lean (bank 2 sensor 1) and p0174 system too lean, showing? ""So that pretty much matches my issues.So I have ordered one for £64.99 and will pay my friend to fit it for me, I don't want my hands dirty haha. Looks like a nice bit of kit and they have their own install guide video.It removes the faulty plastic unit setup and replaces it with a billet aluminum setup.Anyway, I have started my pence per mile table that I have used previously and will get that updated soon once I pay for the part to be fitted.The dealer has agreed to pay half the bill which I am happy with just to get it over and done with, I am happy with the car apart from this issue so it will be nice to carry on driving.MOT history also states it has an oil leak so will start looking in to that and make sure its kept topped up in the mean time.Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 Edited by GrantD5 on Sunday 19th December 17:38 ","December 19, 2021"

Fantastic creamy smooth six cylinder engines and they feel quite sporty and pointy for an SUV shaped thing.

C70R,"helix402 said:willmagrath said:I didnt realise they did 2wd versions, stupid!I’m 99% sure the E83s were all 4wd.You're absolutely correct.They all use the then-new BMW X-Drive system, that runs them in RWD under normal conditions and engages the front wheels via a transfer case when it detects slip.I've a real soft spot for these. Basically a jacked-up 3-series platform (identical underneath to the 4wd E46s that the US market got), with a slightly taller body.The interiors, particularly the dash plastics, are pretty low-rent - but they are excellent VFM. helix402 said: willmagrath said: ","December 20, 2021"
C70R,"The DISA valve failing should be VERY obvious, with a pronounced tapping/rattling from the inlet manifold on idle. You can test for it by disconnecting power to the valve's solenoid while the engine is running, which should make the noise stop - there's a good YT video showing how to do that.Your EML issues are likely to be linked to sensor of some sort. O2 and MAF sensors are the most common culprits.Also, don't rule out a tear in the intake trunk (from the airbox to the inlet manifold), which lets a load of unmetered air in and causes the car to run poorly. Easy to check, cheap and simple to replace. ","December 20, 2021"

Check for oil on the manifolds (or the smell of oil sat in traffic), and wetness under the inlet.Also be worth doing the CCV system.The M54 bloody loves an oil leak.Like the DISA valve, I wouldn't just ""do"" the CCV for the sake of it. You can check the vacuum under the oil cap with the engine running to give yourself a good idea of the CCV health.Remove the cap, and place your hand over the hole - a slight sucking feeling (and small change in idle) is normal, but strong suction suggests that the CCV has had it.Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 Jhonno said: Edited by C70R on Monday 20th December 10:21 ","December 20, 2021"

GrantD5,"So its been a fun start to 2022, a few questions on the Facebook pages!So I noticed the start up was a little sluggish. But thought nothing much of it and wanted to wait until after the DISA valve was replaced, so we will start there.Ordered and X8R DISA valve kit and it was a very nice piece of kit!But on the day of going to get it fitted, the car wouldn't start. I had left an iPhone lead plugged in over night in the 12v plug that had a red light shining all night and I thought this must of just trickled the battery down enough.This got left a couple of days now as I was busy with work etc and this is kind of a second car. Anyway a couple of days later, I jump started the car and it worked fine so I took it for a spin around the block. Later that evening I took it to another friends too have the DISA valve fitted.All was good, the car started and I drove home and it drove better with the new valve in place.I went to the car in the morning to take it to work, NOTHING. Again this got left a couple of days, tested the battery and it was on the orange light at 12v and it was a 5-6 year old Bosch unit, but because it started up when jumping I decided to buy a new battery. Couple of days later and £140 later I jump started the car and took it to Halfords and had a new Yuasa battery fitted.New battery in and the car started, just. Anyway, I had some time to kill and went for some break with with my mother before heading to work, came out of McDonalds and NOTHING the car wouldn't start. The car was recovered and dropped a couple miles back home.I had some recommendations for the earth straps which I have bought now (still not fitted just yet), but tried to start the car with the car earthed with a jump lead with no luck. These are going to be changed soon anyway as they are cheap enough and appear to be problematic.With the new battery in though, and trying to start the car and you could hear the starter having a tough time. Great.For those who don't know the starter is under the inlet on these M54 engines. So while this was being done I decided to replace the CCV system with a kit from C3BMW. This was all fitted today. I also got a little dehumidifier pouch as the car steams up on the windscreen a fair bit inside.Here are some fitting photos from today, was a bit of a pain getting the inlet off, didn't really find much online for getting the inlet off from an X3 M54 but got there in the end.The sonofabeech. It was spinning freely. And original.Didn't get any photos of the new CCV kit fitted but its all fitted and the old pipes were very brittle. The car is all back together and it was a relief to hear it start up first time once all back together.It was evident that the oil leak is coming from the Vanos leak so the inlet will be coming back off very soon to have this replaced which is annoying, but not know how to do so, this will be done along with a full service of the car.The Pounds Per Mile sheet will be updated soon, I don't even want to look currently!Some nicer updates soon hopefully and do not wish this job on anyone!

Typical BMW really.Anyway, while visiting my friend in Wirral, we took a trip to watch my local team Dagenham & Redbridge play away at Altrincham. It was not worth the 3-0 defeat but I got front row parking essentially.Couple other photos since the last update.Today see the oil & filter change, air filter, pollen filter, spark plugs and HEL vanon braided pipe. Also had the Parrot kit removed and centre vent replaced.I was told upon purchase the coilpacks had been changed recently, it appears they have replaced all 6 with Bosch units.The plugs looked a little worse for wear.Replaced with some brand new like for likes.Old oil filter out. Yuck.Pollen filter. Yuck.Air filter wasn't too dirty but it felt very stiff compared to new.Vanos pipe replaced with a HEL braided unit.Finally it was time to fix a couple bits on the interior, I removed some glue from the internal side of the windscreen from permit stickers etc. I also had the Parrot kit removed FINALLY, it had been dangling around since the early days of ownership, and I also replaced the centre vent. The new centre vent has silver tips on the vent adjusters, so I am assuming this is from a facelift, so I am going to try and get the sides to match now, definitely looks a little nicer for me anyway.There was a lot of wiring to come out!And a photo to end the day off.The car needs a massive clean especially after that Sahara sand landing here, and the engine bay can now be cleaned after it's had a service.Next up I think will be a rear parking sensor replacement as it is killing me, the beep alone when going in to reverse grinds me.

There is no consistency and ultimately the ones who were unwilling to assist lost out on my custom.I have it on good authority that all BMW dealers are able to offer extended test drives, for days if they want to, without any fuss. Whether they choose to or not is a different matter however. ","June 05, 2020"

Ride slightly bouncy with standard suspension and 17"" wheels. Standard lights are a little disappointing after being used to Xenons.However, all of the above can be remedied with a higher spec 6cyl car - just factor increased depreciation with the new X3 due later this year.A great car overall and objectively, one I'll find very hard to justify replacing.

A six-pot diesel 5-series Touring would be a very nice place to be and to drive. But check out E-Class equivalents.The X1 isn't a 1 series as such. It was not on the F20 platform.

I would stick with the X3 if she wants a SUV and go with the 2.0d over the 2.0i. jason61c said: scot_aln said: fflump said: ","October 27, 2021"

eeLee,The X1 interior on the latest model is flexible with seats sliding back/forth but load space in the back is inferior and the 1-series finish and options are lower tier than a 3/5-series.We have an 2021 X3 on that basis. ,"October 27, 2021"
MarkGArgyle,"Hi all,About to take my next test drive of the m40i (which was fantastic first time out by the way). Conscious this is about 3yrs old now and I am buying used between 38 and 43k. When is that fantastic lease deal up, when will the big quantities of leases hit the used market?Have a fairly exiting spec for my £40k and there are not so many cars around right now. Happy to wait as my 3 touring is “sucking diesel”Apart from adaptive and pan roof any major options I should consider?Thanks Mark ","May 03, 2021"

ukpolak,I’ve been looking at AUC < 6 month with certain must have specs and have seen numbers steadily decrease from c. 6 to now just 2 on the BMW site. A handful of lesser specced ones were up a fortnight ago for £47k / 2k miles or so from Sytner but didn’t have what I was after. Carwow brand new £55 “reasonably loaded” doesn’t look so bad after all but serves to support the above comments.Note per bimmers x3 / x4 forum for G01/02 that the LCI is due to be announced in a few weeks which may push prices down if supply is reasonable. Some leaked pics with styling concepts etc there.Good luck!!! ,"May 03, 2021"
cossy400,"We are looking at these and also the M40d, but im sure i read somewhere about the oil filter squashing up on the 40i and it taking an engine with it due to the oil service recommendations.Please tell me ive imagined it as i cannot find it now.They ve got a 40i X3 and 40D X4 at the dealer in Stoke but dont think they are allowing test drives yet either.45k is my max limit.

If you want to keep it simple then insist on a HP (regular car loan) and I’m sure they’ll still do you something as that’s got to be better than cash. Then complete paperwork, pay for deposit, take car and within 14 days exercise your right to withdraw from the agreement. That way you benefit from the best price (assuming they’ve done that in exchange for your taking out BMW finance) but you can then choose to pay as you like - cheaper loan, cash etc. You call the BMW FS and exercise your right to withdraw, then pay up using a debit card.

Earthdweller,Cheap subsidised lease and finance in new high performance SUV’s is one thingI’m not sure the demand is really there for 3 year old ones in any great numbersIt’s a family car after all .. and although this is PH a and “speed matters” does it really for people looking for a family bus?£40k+/- buys a hell of a lot of car new on subsidised financePersonally I wouldn’t be rushing in but rather seeing how it plays out ,"May 03, 2021"
RBrown,"My M40i is March 2018, so was one of the first in UK.Tbh, I love the car. Have had it now over 3 years and never get bored of driving it.I did look at changing it, but going to settle the finance and keep it for a bit longer. I usually change my car every 2.5 years. Settlement figure is £29k and not anything else that is taking my fancy at the moment.Good luck in the search. ","May 03, 2021"

130idvg,"Good deals can be negotiated on new. We had the dilemma of buying something used with a bigger deposit and financing the balance on a low interest loan (finance on used is set at 8.9% by BMW).In the end, we did exactly what they hope you do which is order a new one. Added pretty much every option (apart from driver assistance packaged and tow bar). Managed to get roughly 10k off (so cost of options). At 2.9% on a pcp, figured we would do something more useful with the cash. Also have the protection of a gfv if the arse falls out petrol SUV prices. ","May 04, 2021"

MarkGArgyle,"SouthSide92 said:How did it go in the end Mark? Did you managed to haggle them down at all?Hi, no further luck in Cardiff, they were simply not interested in getting the business so I held out and went to Staffordshire to pick up the car. It had more miles (17k on a 2020 plate if I recall), not sure how they managed that in a pandemic but it was a good deal as I work from home so the car pretty much remains doing the kids runabouts during the week before it get it back for the weekends. I have had it since May and it is now on 22k.All went well, it had 4 new tyres which was a pleasant surprise given they are 21” rfts, apart from getting a speeding ticket that day (zoom awareness course sorted that) and they forgot to service it which was a surprise…all sorted at my local dealer with the supplying dealer picking up the tab.It is averaging around 19-21mpg round town and will do approx 32mpg on a run which I think is pretty fair considering the performance and pops/bangs which are quite comical for a family suv and makes me smile still today. I have seen as low as 11mpg when stretching its legs though but you should not think about fuel cost with one of these.Finally the only sour point was that both my son and myself were thrown BMW motorsport coats also as part of the deal, despite many chases and promises they still didn’t show up. I have not given up though!Some gratuitous shots, seats are fantastic as (re)posted above.It is currently worth approx what I paid for it on wbac.Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 SouthSide92 said: Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:49 Edited by MarkGArgyle on Monday 13th December 22:50 ","December 13, 2021"
