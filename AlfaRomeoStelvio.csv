cue2,But there are no Stelvia to vote for!

PapaSmurf,Finally washed it after 4 months.
cue2,"Looks good.Mine will be getting a thorough Swissvax treatment when the weather warms a bit; Paint , plastic and leather ."
markies,washing mine tomorrow all being well
cue2,"Got mine all dirty yesterday on the lanes of Kent and Surrey. Taking my son and his teammates to the Olympic Velodrome again first thing tomorrow, like 06.40 so don't think I'll be into washing it when we get back."
ianrm,Today I have washed him
PapaSmurf,"Fixed that for you.All Alfas are women, FACT!"
Gator1,"Haha, I will go with 'it'. Love your 'motto': WITHOUT HEART WE WOULD BE MERE BMWs"
markies,I washed her but didn't rinse her backside properly
ianrm,He could be transgender or gender neutral :judge::biglaugh:
Tilum,"I had the official OE Carbon Fibre V grille (PN 50903642) fitted to the Stelvio Qf on Friday, replacing the original silver one. It looks much more in keeping with the spec of the car (as there's barely any silver on the exterior). I'll post some pics when I get the chance!"
PapaSmurf,"That moment in the supermarket when a random stranger comes up to you and says ""love your Stelvio, great looking car"""
cue2,"An Italian friend who I haven’t seen for a while described the new Tonale to me as better than the Stelvio which “looks like a doped Giulietta.” I replied to him that I’d doped my Giulietta and he said “very, very, very nice”. I will discuss this with him at Geneva next Tuesday...."
cue2,Drove to Gatwick and parked up in short stay to visit Geneva.Here’s a pic of the side of the F1 car.
leraunch,Took it down the skip yesterday. Had to dispose of our 17 year old 3 piece sofa and footstool. After hammering it down a little it fitted in with both seats down. Got a few weird looks from people with their white vans ass pulled up in the Stelvio and carrying a sofa out the back!:rofl:
cue2,"I got a comment from one of the operatives at the tip, reminding me the Stelvio will be expensive to run!"
cue2,Just treated the leather to a Swissvax cleaning. Will follow up with the Leather Milk as per their instructions. Those Alfa logos on the headrests are nice.
markies,She hasn't been washed or vac'd in over a month. [hanging my head in SHAME]
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
W1NST,"Had the wheel colour changed to black and removable tow bar put on before I collect it next week. Know the black alloys aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, but I liked them and I fancied a change from silver and anthracite which I have had in the past."
W1NST,"Today I have bought my Stelvio and brought it home, that’s what I’ve done to my Stelvio today!"
cue2,I drove to Goodwood FOS today in the Stelvio. I then went straight to do a bit of cycle coaching with the youth section of our club.Interesting festival but for me the mix of Alfa and Jeep did not work. A comment about the Tonale from a young lady on the stand was odd to both my wife and I. She said the car has had mixed reactions..
markies,Gave her a much overdue wash
markies,Mixed reactions.... Wonder why. I have not been to FOS but in the showrooms the Jeep presence dilutes / distracts/ I don't really know the right word - the Alfa image. It's like a glorious landscape photograph ruined by a bin lorry driving past
W1NST,Headrest coat hanger fitted for my suit jackets to stop the buggers getting creased when I am visiting clients.
W1NST,Fitted new silicon protective key covers off eBay from China. They had the cheek to charge me £3.18 including postage for 2 and I got them in less than 2 weeks!!
Mash1138,Managed to update Maps.over 10GB - ??On the old tom tom live 2 in the Giuletta was only 3GB for all of Europe? Is there more than just the maps updated?
leraunch,Took my lad to his end of primary school prom last month having cleaned and polished it all up. He had his tux on and all looked the biz think his class mates were suitably impressed. However that was until another girl turned up and stole his thunder in a Lightning Mcqueen replica car. Must admit i was envious:hehe:
Mash1138,Gave the Milano a good wash..
markies,Brushed out the boot after a trip to the tip! Thankfully the boot liner makes it so much easier
cue2,I used mine to go to the tip too this week. 7 trips of garden waste. Cleaned up perfectly as I used the boot floor upside down instead of carpet side up.
cue2,I put the Thule bike rack on the roofbars. There’s a big “NO” for use with carbon bike forks. That’s two of my bikes and my son’s bike disallowed. Lucky I didn’t sell the alloy framed bike.
W1NST,Any pictures Cue - are you keeping the bars and bike holders on permanently? I don’t know whether to put mine on that I had for the CRV or get a tow bar one.
cue2,I could take the bars etc off between uses but take bikes to track session every Monday. Scary when I got there last night and luckily spotted somebody had forgotten to get the height restriction out of the way. Could’ve been very expensive indeed. There’d be damage to the car plus £3k for the bike...
cue2,Here’s the setup. Front wheel is removed from bike and put in its bag inside.
Tremolo Arm,"Washed and updated the software on my Milano and ordered these badges, which will go where the clover leaf badge is on that Quadrifoglio model.https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Alfa-Rom...310969?hash=item211866cc79:g:-u0AAOSwPhdU50wv"
Mash1138,Updated Software/Maps. I wish you could get what exactly is updated in maps or software...Fitted K&N air filter.
SickStu,Fitted cheapo Aliexpress carbon effect V frame grille cover with a view to getting a real one if I liked it. Looks pretty good to me.Also got the badge housing cover but removed it as I prefer the original.
cue2,"Drove my son and his friends to a Lazer Combat session and the main guy there complimented me on the Stelvio, saying it came top in all the tests. Then let me off ten quid because he didn’t have the change. Next offered to let me join in free of charge, when he was charging other parents. The power of the Stelvio!"
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
Sweeney70,Updated my maps while taking the missus to do an IKEA trip - i;d rather sit in the car park for the duration than go into that place.Then stuck it in Red mode for the drive home which I don;t do often enough.Gonna do the software update on Tuesday - the day before I take it in to the dealer for the volumetric sensor replacement to sort the alarm issues out.
Alfie155,"What have I done to my Stelvio?Only bloomin' this...Got caught in roadworks temporary traffic lights near Seaford, Sussex a week or so ago and they were stuck on red for at least 12 mins. As I was right next to centre bollards I couldn't perform the escape manoeuvre until the cars fore and aft gave up and did their 3 point turns. It was very dark, I was fed up, not familiar with the area and just clipped the opposite curb. :grumpy:Anyone else attempted a DIY repair of these gorgeous wheels yet? I refurbed a set of Speedlines for my old 155 Silverstone once but that was relatively easy as I sprayed them black afterwards which hid most of the infilling."
cue2,Very upsetting but I reckon you’d find it less scary if you take off the loose bits and build up in the scuff with silver paint from a touch up pen.

markies,A decent wash. Hopefully come weekend the inside will get some attention - feed the leather etc... and that is not a euphemism....
cue2,"Bought a second Thule bike carrier for the Alfa roof-rails from a bike shop then realised I’d have to use two keys. However, I realised you can get sets of four the same so I could have just one key. I went to an online shop which happens to be reasonably local , giving me an excuse to drive!They were able to sell me a pair of lock barrels to match the first carrier, saving me buying £35 of new barrels. You also need a master key to remove the barrels so it would have been £42.Very helpful for a £17 sale, I’d recommend themRoof RacksWelcome to theroofracks.co.ukwebsite that is specific to absolutely everything from Thule and Rhino.

cue2,Got a quote for GAP insurance for years 2 and 3 as the insurance covers the first year. With the likely effects of emissions zones on resale value it may be a good idea...
cue2,The weather was so nice this morning I took the opportunity to break open a new jar of Swissvax Best of Show. Lovely to use and very effective stuff. I’ll park facing the other way tomorrow so I can do the other side. That’s the side with the fuel flap so hopefully I can do that without it coming off.

cue2,It’s beading well but I’m under the impression the SUV doesn’t have many fans on here.
markies,Winter tyres fitted!
Sweeney70,"Today, and yesterday and the day before and the previous week - been pumping up a slowly deflating rear tyre.Haven't had the time to investigate and see whats wrong.Want to avoid paying for a new one cos I'm have tyres as part of my maintenance package built into my lease."
David P,Alfa Romeo Forumwww.alfaowner.com
gobits,Added the logo puddle lights...
cue2,Got a new case for care products.
Sweeney70,That is sooooo non-essential.I absolutely love it!
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
cue2,Had the fuel door replaced last week. Looking much better.
Alfie155,"Took the Milano to Thames Alfa by invitation and met a chap from Alfa HQ who is going to look at the alarm in league with a technician being flown over specially from Turin. A Stelvio QF owner also dropped his off for similar scrutiny, just before me. Anyone on here?I was told that an alarm isn't fitted in the rest of Europe hence Turin being interested in looking at the fault(s) in the system that the UK market is experiencing.I also handed over a list of other things needing attention, not least of all the Engine management light, excessive Adblue consumption and two spells in limp mode. I mentioned that a diagnostic showed 83% full DPF. That apparently is nothing to worry about as readings approaching 200% are not unknown (not necessarily in Alfas.) I can't get my head round a reading over 100% - full is full surely? Apparently not.Anyway here's hoping such exhalted attention restores my diminished faith in the most sophisticated car I've owned.My loaner is a lovely red Guilia Technica diesel on a 68 plate with red/black half leather. No heated seats, flappy paddles, heated steering wheel, a distinct lack of usb's and not many of the driver assist gizmos. Interestingly the dna switch doesn't reset to N when the ignition is turned off so was very surprised at the acceleration away from the lights but then realised it was already in D.I'll update when I get Milly back."
alfaitalia,"Its 100% of what they deem is enough blockage to instigate regen....not 100% of full (ie blocked!). That's why its possible to get 200% or whatever....its just double the amount of soot that's required for regen.....but possibly conditions have not been met for regen to occur...short journeys, not hot enough engine,stopping before regen is completed, too low a fuel level in tank, etc ,etc. Never been up to 200% (I have a DPF monitor app on my phone that also keeps records of the previous regens, times, temp reached, before and after percent blockage etc...recommended) and it usually does not get past about 120%.....and down to 15-30% after regen."
Alfie155,Thanks . That ties in with what the guys at the dealership were saying.

cue2,"I took the Stelvio out for the first time in three weeks or more, just to hopefully charge the battery and get it moving. It was nice to experience the way it drives. A real pleasure. Not that I like driving for the sake of it."
W1NST,"Glad to hear Cue - did the same with mine last week and every warning light under the sun came on - abs / hill hold / power steering , collision mitigation / abs and a few more. Technician came out but a sensor needs replacing and all the Alfa Dealers near me are shut. Lucky I’ve got 2 Mito Twin Airs as back ups. I must admit though the week before I have started road cycling again which I know you are fond of - I was quite a handy junior for Kirkby CC before I switched to Rugby and I had a problem with one of the jockey wheels coming off on my Campag Record rear mech so had to get the missus to pick me up - popped the rear seats down, put the bike in and I actually turned to her and said i’d forgotten just how nice a car it was to be in. They really have upped the interiors - thought my 159 ti and GIULIETTA Exclusive were nice but the Stelvio / Giulia are another level. 2020 facelifts are a slight improvement as well but not enough to get me to spend £10k changing form mine. Stay Safe!"
W1NST,Fixed it and gave it a damn good thrashing this afternoon!

cue2,I looked out of the window and was still there. Must drive it one day.
cue2,Good choice of tyres. They are fast those Michelins.
W1NST,Yes - i’m a Conti fan traditionally - especially Gatorskins for winter and sportives but have switched to Michelin on my best road bike on Campag Neutron Ultra wheels and they are definitely quick.
Mash1138,Gave it a good overdue wash/clean in and out yesterday....Time to add to diary to do more regularly...
Mash1138,Clean again...
cue2,I drove it! As good as I remembered it.And parking up I still don’t understand why the US owners want an HD image from the reversing camera.
cue2,I used the car a couple of times and now the Stop/Start is working. That means the battery is reasonably well charged despite it sitting unused most of the time for weeks.
Mash1138,"SS hardly ever works for me,even when driving regularly..?"
leraunch,"Took the Stelvio on Safari yesterday at West Midlands Safari park. I was a bit worried the Alfa Red would attract a few animals to sit on it, fortunately the bloke in front had a garish orange Audi Q8 which the camels took a liking too."
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
Alfie155,I bet he got the hump.
cue2,A lot of camels live in Kuwait.
GVblue,"Well, as we pick up our new Steve next week I thought I'd look on here for some tips as to what little adornments (with the relevant links to Ebay) I could lavish on him to make him feel wanted and loved.Unfortunately, you guys seem to have done little more than wash them so it looks like I'm going to have to start scouring the internet myself."
cue2,I got some more Alfa accessories today for mine. A set of the luxury mats with the grey stitching. Yesterday I treated the leather with Swissvax Leather cleaner followed by their Leather Milk and the Matt adjustment finisher treatment.
cue2,I’ve already specified the boot rails and the load-retainer.
cue2,"And , of course , the blu montecarlo key cover."
cue2,"Here, the mats are pretty much as the std ones but with the name embroidered on, a rubber tab opposite with AlfaRomeo script and the grey stitching on the binding."
GVblue,"For some inexplicable reason you can't get Alfa Red key covers. Luckily, I have some spare covers (my wife bought me some M/C blue ones for my Misano Blue Giulia). I also have a spray can of Alfa Red paint and one of lacquer so I have painted my own in readiness.. That's over £110 saved.How can Alfa justify £56 for a small piece of painted plastic, other than they know some of us will pay it.?"
cue2,The standard one is grained black plastic. They either paint this a lot to do the body colour ones or they’ve spent money on an ungrained mould? Perhaps they are free to some customers and the high price makes them grateful.

GVblue,"Well, since getting our Stelvio just over a week ago I've painted the grey primed wheel hubs black to match the wheels and prevent rust. I've fitted a dash-cam. I've replaced the standard puddle lights with Alfa logo ones which, at £13.99 a pair, work damn well. I've adjusted the 'self levelling' headlamps as the guy who set them up in the factory clearly used Marty Feldman (you're showing your age if you don't have to google him) as a reference point. Fitted Epsonix's s/s device. Oh! and I've sprayed the key covers Alfa Red, the same as the car.Might get around to driving it sometime."
sik,Updated the Maps from 1036.9756 >> 1052.10501. It was straightforward enough and took about 45 mins.

Same price as just the two rear ones from Alfa and they,in my opinion, are spoilt by having 'STELVIO' printed on them.I think they would look even better on a non Veloce model where they would blend with the black trim"
cue2,It’s funny how the official accessories seem to be for people who forget and need to be reminded the name of their car.
W1NST,Bugger - that explains now why the GIULIETTA ones don’t fit!
Wombat408,"Had fitted Madness Autoworks Lusso pipes, lowered ride by 2"", fitted 15mm spacers. NO issue with the ride quality, a big YES to handling better, and a big YES to sounding better. Overall, a big YES to Madness Autoworks Austin TX."
alfa1959,Today I have installed a K&N air-filter and the car feels much better!! it feels as it can breathe now.
sik,I added puddle lights to my rear doors. I need to adjust the focus a bit though - the front ones are much sharper.
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
cue2,Is that facing the right way?
GVblue,"Correct, they're marked left and right and that looks like the left one is on the right hand door."
cue2,"Correct, in that it is incorrect?"
sik,"I couldn't decide which way round. It'll literally take two minutes to swap them over though, once I can drum up the enthusiasm!"
GVblue,"I have them on our cars, if you look carefully they will probably have L and R on them.I put mine on the wrong way round at first."

They work.next to go in is epsonix’s SS disabler and some eBay door lights.
Muz,Inspired by this thread I bought and fitted some £16 Ebay front door Alfa puddle lights.
CABBLACK,Were they easy to fit
Muz,"A couple of mins each side. Easiest job I’ve done on an Alfa for yearsGently, with the help of a duster to cover the small flat headed screwdriver, prise out the old ones, disconnect with a push with the screwdriver on the connection, connect the new one and pop back in."
Deman77,"Winter tyres went onto stock wheels. Two frosty mornings in a space of a week is my sign. Road force balancing too - this thing did wonders to my Volvo in the past which had woeful road noise and ride but they are saying there was nothing out of whack with Alfa wheels or Pirellis so it was just old weights they had to do.went with AR homologated scorpions as they seem to do well in the wet and dry in the tests and they are the lowest load rating in the size and I don’t want bumpier ride then Alfa designed. I originally wanted pilot alpins but they have silly high noise rating for the stock size rears though fronts are quieter so I decided Alfa knows best.+11c and dry. Went home long way round. Didn’t feel much different from pz4 in this weather, same noise levels, same comfort, didn’t feel them overheat and I can feel some feedback when turning. I’m not tuned into this car yet nor am I comfortable to push it so can’t really offer proper comparison. I like that they have nicely overlapping operating ranges because with contis in the past there was always a big noticeable change from hardened summers to very soft winters. Pirellis both compounds in this weather felt similar to touch too - I am sure winters are softer just was not obvious.Pz4 skips for me at 10c and below. Scorpions don’t seem to."
Deman77,"Changed the door lights today to 4 for £20 from the people’s republic. Easy enough to do, probably need a minute each but I had to scrape out cut outs on new lights as fitting was not clicking in so it took me 20min.The originals were scorching hot - in pretty much 30sec that it took from opening the door to wedging them out I could not keep my hand on the back of them. I flicked door lock with door open and they definitely go out with doors closed. Must be just super warm lights. I wonder what other lights are like that. No surprise every time I unlock the car without driving battery drops 0.05v. The Chinese LEDs are perfectly cool to the touch.Doing this for 20min and reopening the doors to check things I managed to drop battery voltage from 12.7 to 12.3 or 100% to 84% according to the app estimates. Still trying to understand how it does SOC estimates - it can say 100% charge from 12.8 after a decent drive all the way to 12.6 after 36 hours idle but I have seen it say 75% at 12.5 last week and today it said 84% at 12.3. I think I will just look at voltage from now on.yesterday put in SS device so by default it is off now. courtesy of@epsonix. That took about 2min of which 1min was spent pondering whether to drop the device into the deep hole or jam it all in behind the front panel."
Deman77,"Brought her back from detailer.Other than extra glossiness and candy look which any wax would do at home after half a day of effort won’t really tell the difference as the car was new, but I expect it to look this way for a while now after a simple wash and bead water better. FWIW the detailer was very impressed with the factory paint job. I had stage one polish included - he said barely had to correct anything. The orange peel is there but no worse than others that’s too big a job to do.All Titan products. Did self healing ceramic on paint, all plastic trim, high temp resisting ceramic on wheels, callipers and exhaust tips.Signature Detail in Bishops Stortford - top guy."
Deman77,Time for the next cheap upgrade.Anyone with small kids have them fidget push against your backrest or generally look like if there was an accident they would not survive?My diagnosis is dangling small feet are not comfortable over long journeys. For very small kids you can buy and adjustable foot rest from Amazon that you will see in background in the last picture that my 4yo uses. But from about 4ft tall 7-8 years old those things do not go low enough. A regular foot rest is too low. Enter toddlers steps with perfect rubberised top and small enough to fit Stelvio tiny footwell. Couldn’t get a nice black colour. This is the least offensive they come - the rest are like crayon explosions.Now we only accept OEM or pretend OEM solutions here. So here is mine. Surface is curved and the badge is hollow so you need padded double sided tape or this crazy sticky gooey washable gel tape thing Amazon sells - in two layers.
cue2,One of the neat details on the Audi A2 was the accessory of storage boxes in the rear foot wells. They weren’t cheap but I got one for my wife’s car back on 2001 when our daughter was little. Got £45 for it a few months back on eBay!

Winter driving and the roads near me are not clean plus had to do some wading last two drives but it’s just been all coming off with a bit of rain off a freshly applied ceramic. But today it is finally starting to ask for a wash. Filthy roads today, tons of salt. An hour of driving with light B road traffic so good cornering speeds, but all I have is a dirty rear bumper and a bit of spray behind front wheels. My old xc90 used to have mud flaps and even so get absolutely covered in muck - especially the tailgate. Stelvio seems to have a very road spray friendly shape and arch extensions really work well.Got to get a pressure washer - can’t bear to stick hands in a bucket in this weather."
Mash1138,"Mine needs a wash too, but weather too cold even for a pressure wash and snow foam."

Muz,"As the temperature is no longer below zero on the south coast I had intended to give my car a wash. The outdoor tap is frozen so that knocked that on the head, so I took a bucket and sponge, toothbrush and cleaned the wheels. I now have a filthy car with immaculately clean wheels and calipers"
Deman77,Mine absolute filth - caked in salt. I could barely unscrew wheel caps to check tyre pressure though frost doesn’t help. I think a bit of heatwave tomorrow afternoon and Tuesday - will be as warm as the inside of my fridge. I’ll give it a wash.

Same price as just the two rear ones from Alfa and they,in my opinion, are spoilt by having 'STELVIO' printed on them.I think they would look even better on a non Veloce model where they would blend with the black trimClick to expand...May were have a pic with them on please?"
GVblue,When I get time later today.
GVblue,Best I can do I'm afraid.
cue2,What do those mudflaps look like from a greater distance? Probably a good idea.
GVblue,"From a greater distance they look the same, only smaller."
cue2,I don’t see them in context in your detail pictures.
Deman77,"After extensive rain water collection tub modifications I managed to hook it up to my pressure washer and give it a snow foam and a rinse. Don’t know if this counts as a wash, Some of the droplets started freezing on towards the end so I only used the mitt on the tailgate and the arches as here I saw some left over dirt. qv wheels are a doddle to clean too."
markies,Brilliant... Thank u... Looks great
GVblue,"Misano blue is my favourite, current, Alfa colour and I would have specced it on our Stelvio, but as I already have a Misano blue Giulia my wife said we would look very sad.I snow-foam our cars but do find it more labour intensive than a normal wash with a mitt and this time of year I find it painfully cold when you agitate (as per the instructions) before rinsing off.One regular process for me is a periodic clay mitt and I would recommend this if you like a deep shine."
markies,What foam do you use? I use Bilthamber foam in a garden spray bottleand it works really well. Never got a decent cling using the foam lance so gave up with then read in various places that the Bilthamber doesn't actually produce a deep clinging foam. On the wife's white car you can see the dirt lifting off....
Deman77,"I use snowfoam pro. It is average cleaning strength but it is PH neutral so does not affect my ceramic. Most of the better cleaning ones strip that off (though they are fine on factory finish). Snowfoam pro also clings very well just not breaking things up brilliantly. If your car is not ceramic coated there are better things. The same company makes ultra mousse which clings and foams the same amount but breaks down dirt much better.This is my first attempt and having used pressure washer first time ever. I wasted half the bottle figuring out correct nozzle settings on my foam gun. That picture is after 10min sitting on the car whilst I did the other one plus the was wet from rain which reduces clinging. I mixed another third of a bottle after to do extra on wheels and the other car and I did much better there - like on detailing videos. So I would say for clinging I do not need anything better - I actually had to go out with a patio brush 2hrs later to kill off all that foam on the paving as it looked like it was going to be there tomorrow and in places there were few square meters if what looking like snow carpet.I will add citrus prewash for next clean and will have enough time to do the actual washing. This thing left lots of traffic film still especially on bottom of the panels when you look from 2ft away and on the other car where I spent all of 5min to put on wait and wash off but it did remove the bulk of dirt so from distance cars look clean. The detailer told me this time of year citrus prewash is a must and is ceramic safe and if I want the water sheeting to come back to ceramic I have to take the mitt to it because it will not sheet unwashed. This was just a test and I would agree 90% rubbish is gone and washing after this would be way quicker.I think it’s not a terrible rinse if you don’t have time, but I was hoping for better. Perhaps it will be more effective when the car has been properly cleaned and does not have a month worth of winter deposits baked into it.I am still recovering from how easy ceramic coated wheels and exhaust tips were to clean. Though it’s not as quick as dark wheels that you never clean."
Deman77,"Thanks will keep in mind.Wow two Alfas, so you never not have to be in one."
markies,I just wish my Stelvio Speciale sounded like my V6 166 on full song 😎😎😎😎
Deman77,So here is a good demo how clean ceramic sheets nicely but dirty does not. The car only foamed and rinsed so lower parts of doors have traffic film on them but top parts of the car are pretty much clean as they hardly get that dirty.Look at the sheeting on front quarter and top of doors but bottom of doors (where the angle is even better it simply runs in uneven lines. I’ll take a mitt to it when I get a chance.

Deman77,"+11 today. What a scorcher. I found an hour and did mine with citrus prewash, rinse off them two buckets and sponge and towel dry didn’t mess about with snow foam today. It came off a lot slicker after a sponge than just a lazy snow foam rinse.I expect should sheet water very nicely now. Rain tomorrow. Let’s see."
Muz,"Had a Williams F1 ceramic coat applied. Total time for prep and application on a car just under a year old - 9 hours. Very happy with how it looks, proof of the pudding will be in the cleaning though. Guaranteed for the time the car is in my ownership"
Deman77,"Guaranteed or not, wash with ph neutral stuff and do not use harsh prewash or various bug or tat removal chemicals. Citrus prewash is mild but try to use the lowest concentration that gives you adequate clean."
Muz,Got a complimentary case of Williams post coating products. am also being sent an email with recommended products to use and how to apply. Very impressed...so farI don’t use car washes and am pretty anal when cleaning my cars too. One of the main reasons I had the ceramic coating done is that I didn’t realise just how long it took to clean a car as big as the Stelvio. I am getting less anal as I get olderI will be using the two bucket wash principle and a mitten rather than a sponge. I have already been told not to use a sponge on anything but the interior plastics!Hard work cleaning a car these days. lol
CABBLACK,Looks great I'm sure thats money well spent
VeloceRosso,That looks beautiful!
Deman77,"You are right - the mitt. Don’t know why I said sponge. Haven’t used those for ages.I’ve been cleaning a much bigger xc90 with two buckets and a mitt for the last 5 years so Stelvio is quite a bit smaller in my case and I also don’t need a step to do the roof. Prewash and power rinse before I touch the car definitely cuts good 15min off the job as stuff on wheels and arches just melts off and should reduce marring even with ONR. I am also glad I modified my rainwater tub to connect it to my pressure washer as there is no staining from water runs now so I do not need to make extra drying passes - my tap water is super scaly so you would always get some stains around boot seals and mirrors as they just drip water forever - I think I will appreciate it more in summer when it dries out fast.I am same as you trying to figure out the quickest and least fuss way to wash it as otherwise I will just stop doing it. One thing that helped is an extra drying towel. Starting up and tidying is 10min each at the moment - if I cut that to 5 I should get to under 40 for the job which should stop it being an event. I’ve also made sure my pressure washer makes next to no noise so I can do this at silly times in summer, before I wake the neighbours with cold start."
Deman77,I stared at those photos for good five minutes. Very nice look. I think I slightly prefer this look to a QV look. Looks classy.
Muz,"Your car is in my favourite colour and I did seriously consider buying a blue Stelvio. Two reasons I didn’t. My wife does not like blue cars and I have never owned a Rosso Alfa, which to me has always been “the” Alfa colour. So more than 10 Alfas owned and now I have one in the right colourIt is a more “look at me” colour on the Stelvio than I expected tbh. I sometimes wish it was more bland when out driving!"
GVblue,You little fibber.
Muz,"Nah, in traffic jams I don’t enjoy it all. I am more of a backroom guy than front office “mine host”! I liked something James May said though, something along the lines of driving a supercar (which clearly isn’t a standard Stelvio) is like hanging a Rembrandt outside your home rather than in it. You are doing the public a service showing them something beautiful but as you are inside it you can’t get the full benefit whilst drivingedit - just noticed that you have two very good looking “look at me cars” clearly an extrovert!"
CABBLACK,"Can't lie I love the fact my Stelvio turns heads, every time I see a BMW or Audi driverStaring I think yeah mate you bought the wrong car. 😊"
Deman77,"Alfas definitely brighten up the traffic. smth about their lines that just makes you take a second look.not many cars for mortals do that for me. Latest Mx-5, fiat500, the two door minis, full fat AMG estates and all the Alfas.So driving one I feel I make other people’s day a big less boring."
alfa1959,"I woke up to a blanket of snow this morning.Just come back from a snowy test drive down a road that leads to a business park that is closed at weekends; I was the only one on the road.I was able to experience for the first time the Q4 system in action and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised, the car felt very sure footed, pulled very well and linear in acceleration.On the breaking side of things, you have to bet a little more careful and judge your distances as expected in this kind of conditions.All in all very good fun!!!"
Deman77,Those look like summer tyres. They will be fine as long as snow is fresh and not compacted or you are cutting to the wet road surface underneath. Any incline and compacted snow or icy surface and the only difference Q4 will make is helping you keep it in straight line as you are skidding on the spot. Braking it will only help with engine braking. It’s stressful. Rwd Giulia on snow+mud marked mild winter tyres will be laughing at you. You pretty much not need to adjust what you are doing if you are on those..With summers you need to be in A use the highest possible gear and constantly be on edge anticipating your braking way in advance. I suggest some snow socks in the boot too.But back to Q4 - see if you can expose torque management in performance pages. I’ve not tried in bad surfaces as I try to keep an eye on the road but flooring it out of a roundabout you can see when she transfers torque to the front.

I have had them on my 159 and yes they do make winter driving in cold, icy, wet conditions much better. I will be keeping an eye out for some scruffy second hand wheels for winter tyres for next winter though."
alfa1959,"I am based in Berkshire, I agree winter tyres are probably a luxury for the very rare snow we get here."
Muz,I have to confess I did notice a difference in sub 7 degrees in wet conditions in my 159 in the winter. Could be a placebo affect I accept. I cannot justify paying for a spare set of wheels and tyres on the Stelvio just yet though.
GVblue,"I live in the Peak District and our Stelvio has summer tyres with about 2000 miles on them.Around five inches of fresh snow yesterday morning on the side roads and our Stelv felt as though nothing could stop it.But, as Alfa1959 says, as soon as I hit slightly busier roads where the snow had been compacted it was definitely buttock clenching time."
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
Deman77,"Why get a set of wheels? Get a set of tyres and just swap them. You get to wear your pretty stock wheels all the time and you know your tyres are balanced twice a year. Hypothetically, If your summers last 20k, the split sets will last you 45k (22.5k each) because summers wear worse in the cold (more skipping less rolling because compound is too hard). So if you will wear through more than one set of tyres during your ownership the only cost is mounting but that also means you balance your tyres twice a year so they drive and wear better.In terms of feeling the difference 3-10c (typical winter weather) is really a crossover area. They would be similar performance to summers in both wet and dry so the perceived differences could be tyre wall stiffness difference or softer tyre compound of the winters. Also if you move from latitude which is more road and comfort to something like pilot alpins or scorpions which is more sporty and equivalent to PS4 or pz4 summers they may feel grippier than your comfort summers in 5-7c but that is not like for like swap. Where you will start feeling the real difference is approaching zero (esp on cold tyres) and also when you go to any true winter surface like black ice on early morning drive or slush or compacted snow - it’s night and day difference as summer can just give with no warning and if you are not 100% dialled in the repair will be more than a set of tyres plus all the psychological trauma. On any inclines it’s magnified. It gives you the confidence not to worry.The only time they underperform is on the dry surfaces going into teens and driving aggressively - they overheat and become squishy. But if it’s a good tyre it will lose grip progressively - you will feel that same as you feel lower grip on any tyres in the wet and just drive less aggressively. But we are taking freak hot weather in winter and dry. In the wet with extra cooling winters can easily go into high 20s with no noticeable drop off."
Muz,"I am always very nervous about having tyres changed given how some tyre fitters get the tyres off the rims with that big crowbar, so changing them twice a year does not appeal at all!I spend all year trying not to kerb the wheels. Maybe I am being overly anal and paranoid here I accept, but I don’t get the feeling that mechanics and tyre fitters are that conscientious, given how many times I find things not put back together properly and screws and bolts missing after having work done.Tend to keep my cars for years so I like things done properly not bodged. I have had an undertray come off a car twice on a motorway not long after an oil change by a dealer too. How hard can it be to put them back on properly?"
Deman77,That’s a reasonable concern. I would not go with the cheapest guy or someone who is nearest and I would specifically discuss the point of what they do if they damage the wheel or break the tyre (occasionally happens during fitting) - the right answer is get you a new one - not a repair. I drive 30min to thetyreshop in chingford - they use plastic heads in the machines to avoid damaging the wheels. My main reason though is they do road force balancing on Hunter machines - it’s extra but worth it.Try to find one that gets lots of business and has some fancy cars get done there and is willing to own up any damage. They would not be the cheapest but your risks are minimal then.
Mash1138,"Just had 2 year service and a raft of warranty fixes:Another new fuel flap - hope this is the last timeNew lower rear hatch, to hopefully stop the shower whenever you open after rainNew battery, need to check what they fitted...New radio power/volume button, last one kept stickingSo glad to have her back (loan car was a Panda!!!).Now want to just go for a long drive...but alas...."
Deman77,"With lockdown seems like CTEK needs to go on once a week now. An occasional essential drive even taking longer routes is not long enough to keep battery happy.

Had to use spanner to get them off - they were full of salt. This was never a problem with plastic caps because their thread goes all the way. These only have thread from about half way so the rest is a free to fill up with rubbish. They do have rubber seals and the salt didn’t go past the thread into valves but still, if you get them make sure to take off regularly."
cue2,I was telling the dealer somebody had stolen my shiny chromed AR valve caps a few years back and he told me I was lucky as they’ve had to cut the things off to check the pressures when servicing cars. Never again!
Deman77,"Aluminium valves and steel caps should be quite “happy” to galvanically corrode and seaze - it’s an odd choice of material esp as they don’t match silver alloy wheels nor the black ones. But the plastic imitations I had from amazon at first felt so cheap to use I just couldn’t bear them - I check my tyre pressure too often and it matters.I’ll put some bike oil on the thread next time. May be thicker grease from the hammer drill, should reduce metal contact points. I hope it was just salt and my frequent use should keep them moving."

Muz,I bought some of those in the Mopar Black Friday week. One look when they arrived and I decided that they’d only go on for the summer. I’ll use rubber ones again once the autumn arrives
Deman77,I read up on galvanic corrosion and it seems that it needs highly corrosive (alkaline or acidic) liquid to cause it. So being stuffed with salt in the wet and left like that would be a problem. I’m going to put some silicone grease on mine too so salt doesn’t create an electrolytic connection. Non winter use should also be fine.

Deman77,There is me clicking the email link expecting to see a screenshot of 3.2sec to 60 from performance screen.I didn’t know they could go this far. Well done.How has it been owning one for what looks like well over a year? What wore off?
cue2,Impressive as mine just crossed over the 8500 mile mark in 26 months. Can’t really justify the thing!
Muz,Please tell me that you have a diesel!
Muz,"Small thing but it impressed me, probably more than it should have!Recently had a Williams F1 ceramic coating and today I found some bird poo in a number of places. Hosed it and it just slid off the paintwork with no wiping required at all.little things and little minds I guess"
Deman77,Summer tyres went on. Skippy is back but not terrible. More importantly better turn in. Could probably still run winters - scorpions been excellent in dry low single digits but it’s turning warmer now and hardly any rain so summers are probably marginally better now and more enjoyable when sun shines plus that customary Easter cold snap and snow might never come.
Deman77,Cleaned the wheels today from all the tyre shop muck and leftover wheel weights sticky tape. Also cleaned and dressed tyres.Then had a go at exhaust tips.What a nightmare.The outside has cleaned up easily with some soap then some tar remover and IPA. But where the chrome rolls over the top and goes a tiny bit inside ( essentially the narrowest part of the tip) on the outside pipes where most of my driving happens and where all that fuel gets spat into exhaust for pops and crackles it took me forever and some. It is not paintwork perfect still but you need to get on your knees to see the remaining spots. That’s just after 1.5k miles. I will now be cleaning those to perfection after every wash instead of just cursory rinse.

Deman77,Remember all those things that you think about someone driving around with an open fuel door? I lost that privilege yesterday.I even forgot to put on the fuel cap after fuelling then took on a rather spirited drive back really long way round using calimoto routing. Only found it open this morning. Don’t see any spillage marks or debris so hopefully just evaporated some v power.

When I did it first time a month ago after 3 months run in, it took me 2hrs."
Deman77,"Gave her a scrub.very unsatisfying - 500 miles and three weeks and not even bug splats. Weird weather. Basically washed off some dust and blasted break dust out of the wheels.

I read it in every motor magazine I pick up with a comparison to German cars!You are clearly deluding yourselfI am too, I cannot fault any of the above on my Veloce, in fact I think all the above is bloody fantastic!The German car fan who prepared and ceramic coated my car reluctantly agreed that the paint quality, on a year old car, was very good!"
cue2,"Claus Busse of Alfa Design says “when you look at the car itself, we want to create something than feels good to the hand. I always say to joke, the best way to experience an Alfa Romeo is to hand wash it....”"
cue2,"My first Giulietta had a rubber bump on the A pillar interior trim to stop the noise of the belt buckle hitting it. It was however on the correct side for LHD. The dealer put on one the RHD passenger side for me, which was nice."
Muz,Yay at last I can use it
Abucd4,"Never heard of it but sounds like nice stuff! Take it you’d recommend? Tempted try the black one on my wife’s Tiguan (the Alfa is ceramic coated), which I can never normally be bothered with."
Deman77,It acts as a sacrificial layer on top of ceramic - so definitely with ceramic. Adds extra slickness with water rolling off and has mild marring filling properties.
cue2,how do you reset the TPMS settings?...
Abucd4,If you mean removing the warning after they deflate just drive and it works out they’ve been inflated after a while and resets itself.
cue2,Mine are set for standard 19” tyre pressures but now need higher settings for 20” tyres.
cue2,Very pleased with the new 20”s
cue2,
Deman77,Wow. Those are stunning wheels close up. Lovely shape. The more you look at them the better they look. Should be manageable to wash too.
cue2,They’re actually a full silver finished version of the Veloce Ti machined-face wheel. Goes well with the bright side-window surround. Should be relatively easy to keep clean and were a pleasure to polish!
Deman77,"I can never properly appreciate design on dark wheels. Especially, cool molten metal designs Alfa does."
Deman77,"apple turned on lossless options in settings music a couple of days ago.I listened lossless format over Carplay today (not high res just lossless) and you can really tell the difference.For starters loading is slow (6 times the size) - I’m on the edge of 5G and often in low 4G - it was just acceptable but I had a bit of start delay for 2 out of 4 songs I played - once started they were fine.For quality, where it’s separate instruments or vocals (like Nothing Else matters) there is a ton of extra detail - sounds really clean. But where it’s a big jumble of frequencies comes in (say Unforgiven) I think the HK is not powerful enough to cope and resolve them all so that’s about the same.seeing as I never use more than 5% of my data allowance of I may as well keep it on as some of the songs really shine."
Muz,"Too hot to actually clean the car so I have given the wheels a serious and thorough clean, red calipers too"
GaryMJ,Today new cheapo puddle lights. Quite pleased with these really.
Deman77,Irony?
GaryMJ,Is that TURBO ? That snail is fast ——————
cue2,I replaced the lovely coloured wheel centre caps for the monochrome ones that are recommended for the Alfa accessories 20” alloys. Managed to prise the originals off using a piastic luggage tag.
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
Mazza200sx,"Recommended as in the size, or are the monochrome one's recommended as in better than the colour logo's? I want to go the other way with them. Monos to colour."
cue2,I’ve always liked to stick to the coloured badges but the monochrome ones are specified as being needed when you buy the wheels. They look bigger in a way. There have been black and silver badges in the past though.
Mazza200sx,Can you buy Stelvio wheels on the accessories website?
cue2,"The Alfa Accesories site is run by Partsworld and they have a selection of alloys but I coincidentally got an email from Mopar so I tried them for the wheel badges and they weren’t very prompt then DHL said they hadn’t been able to deliver due to there being no house number. I tried to use their link and it didn’t work so I emailed Mopar. A nice lady phoned from Alfa Romeo in Lombardy to apologise. A couple of hours later the small parcel arrived , complete with house number. I then got an email follow up to apologise and a 10% off on my next Mopar purchase."
Alfie155,Before and After pics would be helpful for the unpersuaded amongst us.
Deman77,Quick wash. Spotted some tar spots. Gave door panels and wheel arches a spray with tar/organic remover and as they started melting I noticed that I had quite a lot. so probably worth doing organic decontamination once in a while rather than waiting till you notice them.
GaryMJ,Xpel PPF today.fantastic job done be Peter at Prestige valeting.
GaryMJ,
GaryMJ,Any photos ?
GaryMJ,What product do you use. I got a few tar spots too. On the non ppf parts.
VeloceRosso,Wow! That’s shiny.Nice work GaryMJ
GaryMJ,LOL ! Yes they did a great job on it. The studio lighting does a fair bit of the work if I’m honest. I had the PPF onto this 3 year old front bumper which might not make sense to some people as the are some small rock chips on it ( now under the PPF) But for me it was about preventing it from getting worse and me living with what’s already there. If I had the money I guess a full strip down of the front bumper n respray would have been the way to go but then again if I had that money I would have just bought a brand new car rather than a 3 year oldI love this car though it make me smile everyday 😁😁😁😁
Deman77,"It rains every other day and ceramic misano blue stays pretty clean so I can’t motivate myself to wash her. Did a little experiment today to see if it is worth washing and decontaminating.First trying to see how washing affects ceramic water performance. Washed 2/3 of the bonnet with soap and then just rinsed with a watering can. No prizes for guessing which part is unwashed. The way it was running off was quite remarkable too. You could see it drag on the unwashed part and just jump off the clean one.Now it will not repel rain the same way because there is not enough water for it to sheet - needs a watering can or a hose. But will be interesting to see if there are fewer beads or if they are smaller size as that means less water and less rubbish staying on the paint.Then decontamination. The surface looks like new standing next to the car - gloss and all but close up from about a foot away at just the right angle I could see there were marks left that ph neutral soap just can’t remove (bug splats or leftover bird poo residue). You can add elbow grease to make it go but that’s a recipe for marring or even scratching if you do it often enough. So did the organic decontamination (melted those marks off so assume did some other good I can’t see). With the iron I thought it would be a waste of product as the surface looked pristine and I couldn’t feel anything running hand over it. But it has some specs of changed colour so it did find some iron.So I have a third of the bonnet decontaminated, a third just washed and a third with about two weeks of road film. Should rain overnight. Will see how it looks tomorrow."
Deman77,Definitely less rain water stays on the washed part on the left 2/3. Also the big beads on horizontal parts are a lot more round and will hopefully roll off more easily when the car is moving - my regular unwashed car does not shed much water when driving up to 60 - will see if this changes. Also note the two water runs on the right - when water rolls off on unwashed part it leaves a wet trail and on washed part it leaves a completely dry trail. The far left 1/3 is also decontaminated. I can’t say I notice any improvement from just mild ph neutral wash in the middle in terms of water performance (this is first decontamination since applying ceramic in nov last year - may be it would be more noticeable after longer gap) - probably just worth doing before applying a sacrificial layer on top a couple of times a year to improve adhesion.Conclusion - definitely worth washing ceramic even when it rains and even when it looks clean.
cue2,You could put this up as a thread on the Detailing section of the site too!
Deman77,"Nah, I’m a Stelvio forum loyalist."
Deman77,"So decided to see if lazy contactless wash would even things up.Mildly acidic citrus prewash on the skirts, wheels and arches. Wait. rinse. Snow foam. Wait. Rinse. Did 2 cars in 40min with prep and tidy so one would be 30min.now common knowledge is that non-aggressive ph neutral (ceramic safe) snow foam is pretty much useless and is just show off thing for mobile detailers.When I tried it in winter I saw pretty much all the road film still showing up on the car. Two things made me try again - near freezing temperature degrades soap performance and winter grime is way tougher.After I rinsed I went with watering can and you can see there is noticeable improvement in water sheeting on what was previously unwashed 1/3. Looks basically the same as mitt washed 2/3 on the left.I was pretty chuffed then it rained heavily so I went to look at the beads when it stopped.At first I thought it looked the same as definitely a lot less water than before on the right plus beads looked pretty similar to the left.But when I tried blowing some beads off they just ran leaving dry trail on the mitt washed side but were very reluctant to start and left wet trail that turned into small beads on the contactless wash side. So definitely an improvement but I am not sure if just pressure washer rinse mechanical impact would have achieved the same and it is definitely inferior to mitt wash.Here are the bead close ups.Really tall and round on the cleaner surfaceAnd below see a lot flatter (and more reluctant to roll off) and more irregular shapes on less clean surface.my conclusion is that whilst snow foam does improve things it is not worth it and the time that takes would be better spent just going round with a wash mitt and two buckets after quick initial rinse with a pressure washer to get rid of the bigger particles. The prep and rinsing of the foam bottle is about the same as filling up and rinsing the buckets and the mitt. I would still do snow foam first on very mucky car so that the rinse is more lubricated and I don’t get grit flying around. I think it will take me a long time to go through my supply though.So after all this experimentation I guess I still have an unwashed car."
Muz,"Would you like to have a go at how the above works and looks like on a ceramic coated Rosso Stelvio?You are obsessed Deman, and why not? It’s fun and therapeutic. Sadly my RA limits my being as obsessive about cleaning my Alfas as I used to be"
Deman77,"Anyone tried a tyre cleaner? nothing stands out like rubbish looking tyres on a clean car.I used to just slap tyre dressing after a regular wash but that yellowing nasty stuff on the tyres always comes back plus tyre dressing makes them look … “dressed”. Magical stuff tyre cleaner - you need to work it in with a stiff brush, leave to dwell then rinse (basically you apply it before washing the car then rinse when rinsing the car) but it leaves very pure and new looking rubber and it does not look fake like after the tyre dressing. It is supposed to keep dressing on for longer or you can just leave a natural look. My Alfa tyres are fairly new so not much improvement but I rotated 2 year old tyres on my other car the other day and inside went on outside (basically never cleaned) and they looked dire. Two washes with this it took and they look like new.I also really recommend organics decontamination (tar remover ). I did on my other car which is uncoated after a wash mainly to remove tar spots but it must have removed a ton of invisible stuff because the clearcoat gloss has really gone up after that wash. Looks like i applied some gloss product even though it was just a wash."
cue2,I bought the FCA Heritage cleaning kit and in the lovely leather case is a tyre dressing. As all the bottles have the ingredients I can tell you the main ingredient for the tyre stuff is glycerin!The tyres have to be cleaned for this and I use the same Muckoff cleaning product as I use for my bicycles.

Deman77,Gave her a wash to get of all the sand splatter from the torrential rain and to help tomorrow rain roll off. Exhaust tips cleaned spotless - she might get confused for an electric.Replaced fancy Alfa steel valve caps with my old £5 ones from Amazon. The Alfa ones never looked right (too bulky and don’t match aluminium wheels for finish) and they need greasing in winter not to seize onto aluminium valves.
Muz,"Washed the bugs off the bonnet and bumper from a 1000 kilometre drive to SW France from West Sussex via Folkestone. No idea what litres per KM means so switched back to Imperial rather the Metric that I changed to on departure from the UK. Just 30 MPG on the drive but much of it in traffic jams and quite a bit of pedal to the metal to leave cars up my arse for dead. The Stelvio Veloce garners so much interest from the French, who love cars without the green eye in the UKI saw a total of one Stelvio and one Giulia on the trip, such a shame that these cars don’t sell well"
nannini,
Deman77,Mine was going to stay on the drive today as I use the electric for short local trips but people doing stuff with theirs and I’m jealous. there is a 2 mile stretch of decent twisty nsp road where I need to go. I hope it’s not too busy. Otherwise I’m coming back the long way round where I know it’s not busy.
VeloceRosso,Not exciting at all but today I took mine in for it’s first service.
W1NST,Where did you buy the new rear diffuser from please?
GaryMJ,Nice rear diffuser ! Where from ? How much ? Did it fit without adjustment ?
MultiDoc,"Finally received my new (used but new to me) Stelvio on Monday. I had already some stuff on order and today I put in new mats, a boot rubber mat, some small side cargo nets in the rear and the front seats rear protective covers from my kids feet.Really happy so far. I’ll be installing the roof cross bars over the weekend probably and will carry over the Thule bike racks I had on my 159."
MultiDoc,"Some more little things today, installed (as per@Deman77recommendations) a Bluetooth battery monitor and a battery charger plug on the battery, updated the maps and the firmware, opted to leave the roof bars uninstalled until I need them, ordered some plastic valve caps to replace the aluminium ones before they seize and also ordered a set of wind deflectors and some parts to mod the exhaust so the valves remain open (depending on how this goes I might revert it back to stock although the soundtrack on race mode is addictive).I had a chance to appreciate the difference and the effect the ceramic coating has on the car by the way, after 3 days of rain and an 80mile drive it looks just if I just washed it! Impressive and well worth the cost."
Deman77,Which wind deflectors did you get?
MultiDoc,"I ordered the Heko ones, have had good experience with Heko on all my previous Alfa’s, so hopefully they’ll be equally good"
Maximus84,I'm also interested in this as my wife scraped the current diffuser against a stone post and it seems expensive for a rather bland OEM one.
GaryMJ,I get it mate !
VeloceRosso,And today if took it in to get the alarm sensor replaced.Still not exciting (but the neighbours will be happier if it stops randomly going off.)
MultiDoc,"After work I installed the wind deflectors and replaced the glove box bulb with one that sheds a bit more light. I was (pleasantly) surprised to see that the bulbs in the glove box, boot lights and the puddle lights on doors, were all LEDs. I am waiting for some aftermarket ones though so these lights will be more bright and useful. The vanity mirrors bulbs though are ordinary halogen and will replace these too."
cue2,LEDs are very visible but don’t really illuminate very well compared to a filament bulb.
GaryMJ,
cue2,In case you forget?
MultiDoc,"That’s correct in general. I replaced however the boot and door puddle lights (which are already LED from factory) with better LEDs so that they are brighter, especially in the boot it’s useful.I tested the wind deflectors on a short drive today and as expected they are fine and infact the wind noise from the mirror pillar is less now (will need to test more next week)."

I’ll hopefully get them back on Monday. Also bought a 2pin EU to UK adapter for the boot power outlet just incase I ever need it."
GVblue,"You may have already mentioned this somewhere but when you say ""roof bars"" are you talking about bars which run front to back or side to side?"
MultiDoc,"No, I mean the ones that run side to side. The car already has black roof rails (the front to back ones)."
GVblue,"Thanks, had they have been front to rear I was just wondering who was fitting them."
Deman77,Can you post photos with deflectors from different angles and give some feedback on them.your door puddle lights must have been aftermarket as mine which shipped nov20 were superhot when on and warm colour so halogen or incadescents. The others are led.

Deman77,Looks like mine had no problem starting after 18 days in Heathrow meet and greet. Will be interesting to see the voltage history.
cue2,"Made the Stelvio jealous by working on the IQ. Clayed and polished plus extra-gloss protectant. A first for me was a change of cabin and air filters, not on the Alfa.Stelvio still beads very well."
Deman77,Does it require replacement? I was under the impression they could just turn down the sensitivity.
RJS463,Standard process is to turn down the sensitivity to 60% on the first fix. Quote from my local AR service people who said that a fly passing at 50 yards will set off the normal setting. Mine was turned down and no issues yet but it’s only been a few weeks.
Deman77,"Mine goes off if I leave the car in the sun and things cool down rapidly at night - sometimes 10pm, sometimes 1am. I have a super shady corner and it never set itself off there. Think big temp difference messes with pressure inside the cabin."
Deman77,"Battery monitor app added ability to compress history in their charts all the way yo 15days on one screen which is nice - mine is 18 days so had to do two screen - you can choose the precise dates too by just poking the date.Here are the 18 days parked across two charts (orange verticals are roughly the drop off and the restart). Seems like it could have done two more weeks easily as voltage was at 12.20 when they were starting it to bring it back to Meet and Greet. just in 5-10min that they took it from business t5 to short term t5 it already refilled pretty well (was 12.44 when I was picking it up 6 hours later) and 40 min cruise around m25 by me put it back to normal as it was 12.88 two hours after I parked it at home. Needless to say the car did not use alternator strategy on either of those drives. So to me the charging logic is not bad, idle drain is not high. As long as there is no parasitic drain (no battery will help) or knackered battery (low capacity) there are no battery issues."
cue2,Typical Alfa. They can’t even control the air inside the car!Mine had a new sensor under warranty.
VeloceRosso,"Well that’s what the dealer said.

If you’ve managed to over tighten roof bars whilst using a torque wrench then they must be faulty.

David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
MultiDoc,"Yes, roof bars (left to right), never had such issue in the past either. The issue is the way the bottom leg is tightened, you tighten a bolt which in turn applies force on a plastic part, I guess doesn’t take too much to brake it off as I found out. I had used a torque wrench exactly because of fear of over tightening that part. I guess either the torque wrench is out of calibration or the bar leg isn’t strong enough.Anyway, I ended tightening them by hand using reason and feel alone."
cue2,I’ve got that set and having difficulty understanding which part you snapped. The cover or the plastic encapsulated clamp bit? And I don’t think they’re cheap. I bought amother bolt-thru adapter barrel for the Thule bike carrier recently and that was extortionately priced.
MultiDoc,"Yes, the bit of plastic that holds the threaded barrel in place so the outside bolt can tighten the leg onto the roof rail.As for cheap or not, to be honest I think the oem bars are overall well made and very well priced, especially in comparison with Thule; Thule although are regarded and rightly so as very good or even top of the range, their pricing is at least ridiculous"

Deman77,Didn’t know you could change the info in the dashboard screen corners. I left top two unch outside temp and time but the bottom right was the utterly useless compass and I changed it to much more handy remaining range. Was buried in infotainment somewhere.You also have two options for what they call a “performance page” on the dash screen in each mode. I changed the G-force for race and dynamic to be some extra gauges. For N and A I changed consumption history chart and the little planet thingies to instant consumption gauge - the line at the bottom is tricky to read.
MultiDoc,I suspect this an MY21 only available option? Couldn’t find a way to change these on mine (my18)
Deman77,You are not missing much. The gauges page is only useful for warming up - two of them are acceleration and braking % which is pointless and the last one is water temp. The big digital speed page is more handy the way this thing gathers speed. I think g force one would have been good if it was leaving the trace of your largest readings for you to look at on the straights. As it stands trying to look at that screen when pulling high g force is not safe.The instant consumption gauge in N is a bit more useful if you will be trying to squeeze more mpg. Reminds me of my hypermiling in Prius.The range instead of the compass I do like though.

Only had one to date. I wonder if magic 5k odometer mark made my car susceptible to more bad luck.

Muz,"Have received a very classy small UK sticker (needs to be classy, it’s going on a Stelvio!) to replace the current GB sticker. Complying with the new law for my return from France later this month. The French already have enough reasons to persecute Brits, not giving them another one"
alfaitalia,That does not comply Im afraid has to be white with black letters and the correct size. The official required size is in fact 18cm wide (that’s just over 7 inches) by 13.3cm tall (just over 5 inches). That size complies with the “Convention on Road Traffic” which came into force in 1968 and has never been changed.Just asking to be stopped for that one as its just so obvious.

Muz,"Had an identical one for years as a GB sticker without problems so a risk worth taking. I am not, by choice, putting a massive tacky white one with black print on there. Unless I have to, maybe I’ll buy one and keep it in the car, just in case!"
cue2,Got a quote for getting the wheel arch mouldings painted Blu Montecarlo to match the bodywork. £360 including vat.
alfaitalia,"I only put them on when going overseas.....peel them off as soon as I get back. The French cops will use anything to stop you (far more so that UK traffic cops).....especially if the car or bike you are on/in is anything other that completely stock (loud pipe, big wheels, lowered etc)....and once they have stopped you its any excuse to find a reason to show you their very efficient ""on the spot"" fine system!. For the £1.50 cost of the sticker Im not prepared to take the risk.Good luck with yours though....it does look nice!"
alfaitalia,Does not sound out of the way....are your arches smooth or textured? Been ages since I saw a Stelvio!
cue2,Don’t get a magnetic badge hoping it will stick to the tailgate!
cue2,That’s for removing the grain by sanding a couple of times and using plastic primer as they’re polypropylene.
alfaitalia,£90 a corner for that seems very reasonable to me....especially with a metallic finish.
cue2,I think he likes the car. He knew about the Quadrifoglio having different bumpers.
Deman77,It’s fair If it goes into the proper paint shop andassuming they are taking them off and refitting too and not just masking as that will show.Avoid any smart-style spray job.
cue2,"It’s a real bodyshop I used before when a neighbour got her parallel parking wrong and the side of the rear bumper got scuffed quite heavily. They did a good job of repainting the bumper , even if their price probably made her wish she hadn’t owned up."

Muz,"Certainly cheaper than buying a Veloce, see my Avatar for how they should look like when done?"
cue2,I drove a Veloce briefly when making my mind up about keeping my Speciale. I thought I’d just driven a Sprint but then the salesman corrected me then showed they cost about the same on a PCP. Having only covered 11000 miles in almost 3 years I couldn’t see the point of starting again.
Muz,Makes sense!
cue2,"I quite liked the look of the Lusso Ti but it was discontinued. The wooden bits made it a bit Lancia‘er than the metal trim bits on the inside and I think it had laminated door glass to make it quieter. Not worth it when I could pay off the bubble and save over £6.5k on the going price on the forecourt for mine. That’s without the upgrade 20” wheels. Interestingly, the arch mouldings on the Lusso Ti we’re painted, gloss black."
Muz,I twiddled all the Alfa logoed tyre dust caps to make sure they weren’t bonding and filled the water washer bottle
cue2,"I got reminded to fill the washer fluid today as well. Booked the car in for the arches to be painted. When I confirmed the price the bodyshop guy tried to ask for double the quote. I corrected his “mistake”. He wanted 2 hours labour to change the skid plate , removing the bumper, but I’ve read people have done it leaving the bumper on."

ban1111,What about those build into number plates? Are the rules different as they are pretty small
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
Muz,I did consider putting the small UK sticker on the number plate for this very reason.
alfaitalia,That never made plates with UK on...only GB.....so no you would still need a UK sticker. And even if you did have a Euro plate with UK it would not count as they don't recognise our Euro plates....what with us having left and all that. I honestly don't see the issue with putting a sticker on.....its not like you can stay there for months like we used to be able to anyway....just peel it off after.
ban1111,"Edited as i am half asleep but the EU does indeed regonise our new UK plates .many of the protocols that were in place prior to our leaving are still in place or have been implemented since and the number plate with the UK bit on it. is one of them as is the not needing a green card as part of our insurance,,"
Muz,"2nd year 18000 mile service (at 11500 miles) and green in every single check column. I bought a 3 year service plan in January so it was great to have a full service, receive a note of everything done on the car, and not have to get my credit card out. Little things please little minds"
Deman77,what are your front and rear pads and discs wear numbers?
Muz,The only measurements I got were the tyres 5.5 to 6 which was pleasing. Brake pads just listed as good
Deman77,Hmmm. I’ll have to reiterate to mine for my coming first service as they told me that will come by default when I broached the subject at booking. I want to see (new/current/replace mm) style readings on my brake pads and discs as I want to monitor wear.Did they give you outside/middle/inside for each tyre or that is special request too?
Muz,Yes three measurements per tyre
alfaitalia,"Not true in afraid....not to mention you can't actual buy number plates with UK in the blue bit instead of GB.....well you you can....in the same way you can buy lots of dodgy stuff online. You have to have the proper 18 cm wide UK sticker....black letters, white background....when you go to mainland Europe."

alfaitalia,Well that goes against the info our number plate suppliers gave us (we have a number plate machine and make/sell plates to our caravan customers) and also against the info on the gov website...which I'm more likely to believe than the Metro paper! Also from the 28 Sept I could not legally supply a plate with the blue UK (or any other nation) section anyway as it's against the new rules....plates just have to be yellow with the reg no on(and suppliers detail/postcode)...nothing else.

alfaitalia,Good colour match? My friends MC Giulia fuel flap looks like it was colour matched by Stevie Wonder......
cue2,Very good match and they filler primer used covers the grain. The painter warned me it wouldn’t be exactly as the alloy and steel panels. It’s a complex paint with a flip to it and the new paint could be a tiny bit different but the surfaces aren’t as continuous/flush as the bumpers are with the rest of the body.
cue2,quite pleased with the integration
MultiDoc,"Just returned from the oil and filter change, all well. Asked the mechanic to have a look for any available software updates, he came back (when he finished with the oil and filter) and said there are 8 updates available, supposedly Alfa only advises for the updates to be carries out only if faults or problems are reported (!) and not routinely.I’ve asked for them to be done and booked it in, hope it won’t cost too much."
Muz,"Was told the sameI when I asked about updates when my car was serviced last week. Updates only free if there’s a fault apparently. Garage said they used to do them routinely, then Alfa started charging them for updates they had done free of charge.I’ll be interested to know what updates are available and the cost. What model year is your car?"
MultiDoc,"That’s what I’ve been told too, that they have to charge as per Alfa. Mine is a 2018 QV, the technician said there are 8 updates available for several modules but didn’t give specifics, I inquired what would the cost be and I was quoted 3 to 4 (maximum) hours of labour but the updates will need 2 days for all of them to be done since some need quite a lot of time and restarts etc.In any case I’ll do them although have no issues with the car at the moment. Due for the 23/11 and will be ready 2 days later"
Deman77,I would check on firmware for the mode selector button as that is supposed to be under proper recall per@epsonix. May be you will get some updates free with that and just pay for the extra work.I will not bother with any updates unless I hear of something properly experience changing.
MultiDoc,"I wasn’t aware of such recall, so you happen to know what it changes or fixes? The only thing regarding the RDNA selector that I don’t like is that it defaults to N after every start regardless of where it was.In any case I’ll let you know what/if I notice any changes after the updates and I’ll ask for a list of the modules that got updated."
pocholin,"I installed black roof rails, easy task really....just laborious."
Deman77,Search by his user name and recall. It was smth to do with corrupt firmware that can brick the selector. Think it’s less than a year old the recall.
epsonix,DNA selector - it wasn't recall but service news.
Deman77,+3 this morning. Garden looked like it was even trying to catch a bit of frost. Tyres are like wood. Skippy was insane and I felt very uneasy stepping on the brakes on the downhill. I’m probably just paranoid but winter tyres going on Thursday.
MultiDoc,"+5 here, have already scheduled winters to go on in two weeks. Skipping is bad at start but when warmed up isn’t bad at all, needs care to get the tyres warmed up though"
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
Deman77,A bit of fishtailing f1 style from cold start or some doughnuts. To me that only works in the dry. when it’s wet even if the tyre is warmed up you probably can’t keep enough heat in it for it to stay really pliable.I have the inverse problem in summer on my all year round winters. When I give it beans in the dry the tyre stays hot forever and it’s starts getting squishy and floaty after it overheats. But when wet it is as good as summer and when I come back from the drive the tyre is almost ambient temp.
Deman77,I probably panicked too soon. They bumped all forecasts by 3-4 degrees over next 10 days and looks mainly dry. Oh well at least there will be no skippy from cold and saves my pz4.The pz4 was very grippy and pliable once warmed up this morning at +5 on the way to the tyre shop. It’s a brilliant tyre the oem.
CABBLACK,"Ist service for the Veloce yesterday done on service plan purchased a couple of months after I got her,£449 for 3 services, Lipscomb advised cost would have been £307.00 for this service alone . As usual found Lipscomb to be very good to deal with efficient and knowledgeable"
cue2,I’m wondering if I should buy a service package for after the 3 years runs out next month or if I can buy it now.
Muz,I was unable to buy a 3 year service plan (years 2-4j on mine until it was a year old (bought at 9 Months and it had just had a service so didn’t need the first service in the original plan I was offered)Be interesting to know if they offer you one before the three years is up. Seems odd to me not to be able to buy in advance.
cue2,I enquired but wasn’t offered it in advanced. Perhaps I could use Lipscomb to do the 3rd service and then buy the plan when I collect the car.
Muz,"Didn’t I see that you bought from Thames in Slough? I bought my Stelvio from them and also the service plan in January, very smooth and easy transaction once it was available. £649 for services 2-4 on a petrol VeloceHad the second service done at Monza last week including a warranty claim on a cracked plastic gear shift top cover. Good, efficient and friendly people."
Deman77,On homologated scorpion winters now and they are not as pliable. Feel slightly harder. I thought it was my suspension settling in in spring that improved the ride but it must have been the tyre swap. I could run pz4 at the top recommended pressure and it felt perfect but scorpions seems a bit stiffer and bumpier - about one damper setting difference (though in tyres you feel it in down move not in rebound) . They are less noisy but I will probably drop pressure towards lower end to see if I can improve the comfort. Pz4 are actually more comfortable at higher pressure - probably better match to spring rates. Luckily qv recommended range is 5psi wide. It could be that they are heavier and higher unsprung weight reduces comfort.did alignment today too. I never checked from factory but at 5.5k now I had both fronts toeing out slightly (effect is tram lining and inner tyre wear) - now toed in. Caster is out of range 10-20’ below the 80’ range but it’s the same on both wheels and not adjustable so I will live with that. Cambers was fine.Rears were perfect.Did roadforce balancing on wheels and all alloys are perfect again but both driver side tyres were a bit out. They couldn’t improve it as alloys are perfectly balanced so no matter how you rotate the tyre against the wheel you can’t get overall balance to improve. They said may be they are a little misshaped from storage (I did turn them quarter turn every couple of months) and that may improve as they get driven a bit. They said it should not affect the actual weights balancing so it can only get better or stay the same.was probably a bit too early to change to winters with forecasts improving but I really hussled them in the way home at 8c and they were not warm when I arrived so will not worry till well into teens. They certainly felt better in crossover temperature dry than cold pz4 did and I did not feel paranoid pushing them or stepping on the brakes - just not as creamy as warmed up pz4 - something to look forward to in spring.

Are you balancing the rims separately and then the rims and tyres together ?"
Deman77,In road force balancing they spin the rim to see how balanced that is then mount the tyre at correct pressure and apply force to squish it like when the car is driven. Then they see how balanced the whole thing is. Then they rotate tyre vs the rim a little to achieve the best overall balance. Sometimes they can’t really get it within tolerances. The weights bit goes in somewhere there but it is sort of independent. That’s how I understand it.
Deman77,Tested kids’ bath mat on suckers as a frost guard last night as I don’t like the conventional idea of shutting a mat in the doors to hold or in any way touching paintwork. There are longer ones if it works.Aside from a fetching OEM look and less scraping I will not bother (my long sponge handled scraper is very effective). The section was completely clear of frost or mist on the inside but the glass must have still been really cold as that section listed up and cleared after 5min idling same way as the scraped section so it does not save time or idling.
Navlet,Are heated windscreens an option on the Stelvio ? Our used Stelvio we got this summer doesnt have one but does have heated seats and steering wheel. I really miss it as the Volvo and Evoque both had heated windscreens which would clear in seconds.Having said that with the OEM battery....
cue2,The 159 had a heated screen at one point. I think it’s patent by Ford has probably finished by now.What Cars Have Heated Windscreens? | Stable BlogAre you interested in knowing what cars have heated windscreens? This article goes into detail on what the technology does and which cars have it available.www.stablevehiclecontracts.co.uk
Deman77,I wouldn’t have one. For an occasional convenience you see the lines if the sun is just right. Really bothers me.You can install an aftermarket fuel fired heater- webasco - that has a benefit of getting the engine to working temp quicker too. I loved that on my Volvo as 4cyl diesel took forever to warm up. It’s battery intensive but the whole battery in Alfa thing is a myth. All that will happen is lower Soc will force full alternator programme - this is what I see on my battery after longish disuse.
alfaitalia,The only thing that I missed on my wife's old1992 Ford Orion Ghia was the heated screen.......got rid of frost in under a minute and misting in about 20 seconds. I'm amazed such a safety giving think was not made mandatory. In the winter you see loads of cars in the morning with only the bottom half of the window demisted.....no one wants to wipe it or it leaves marks....and leaving the car to idle to warm up and clear it should be avoided on all modern cars and wont work on dervs anyway. I needed to look for it to see it....you shouldn't really see it as you are focussed on the distance rather than the screen.
Deman77,are you sure it’s not rose spectacled memory? The rear screen heaters in all the cars I ever had would take good 3min to defrost - probably less than 5 but definitely not 1. Unless windscreen ones are significantly stronger I see it saving me 2min at most on my 5min idling demisting (I can see it being worthwhile with a diesel) but I would still have to sit there idling. So it may be somewhat more convenient depending on the engine but it would not prevent people not willing to wait driving around with obstructed view.
alfaitalia,"Much stronger.....no comparison really.....I'm talking your standard scrape off frost here like I've had the last couple of mornings....not sheet ice! It softens really fast then the wipers take it straight of. There are a lot more elements (smaller of course) packed a lot more tightly together than on a rear screen. If it wasn't fast it would kind of defeat the point and people would still have to scrape. Idling an enginel on a modern petrol car does it no good either....start her up, seat belt on, into gear and drive gently. That way there wont be so much excess fuel washing oil off the bores for so long and the cat etc will get up to temp faster. Warming up cars by idling is a thing of the 80s!In this test with thick frost the Ford was driven away after two minutes.....but it clearly could have been wiped away by the wipers rather earlier than that."
manc350,"i had a heated screen on my 91 Scorpio 24v, it was great.. hundreds of little wiggly lines and it would clear frost / mist in no time... I miss that feature a lot !Space between filaments was about 1cm and covered full height + 95% width of screen... looked like tis -"

The tough bit is not getting rid of the ice but warming the glass enough that it does not mist on contact with cabin air. If it can do this much in 2min without touching then if it was scraped first or have a bath mat on it, it probably could be on its way in under 30sec."
Navlet,"Heated windscreen would clear in seconds in the cars when I've had it fitted, much better than using a scraper you just press a button. As for lines being visible you would only see them if the light was at a certain level / angle and I hardly ever noticed them."

Deman77,"First service done. Rather embarrassingly my brake pads were only 5% worn all around. After 5.8k mainly B roads and in race whenever I can. I do brake mainly with paddles and anticipation but from amount of brake dust I wash out every week I would have thought at least 25%.Ancaster Dartford were brilliant. Very friendly and accommodating - from the people booking taking notes, to service assistance guys on the day, to mechanic.Mechanic (Mike) went out with me for a test drive to demo a low speed rattle I wanted them to fix. He acknowledged but said didn’t sound like suspension and it will be tricky to find - Alfa will only pay them for the work and parts so if they spend ages trying to find smth they are paying for it themselves. I think it’s fair and he managed my expectations. In the end they checked out there was nothing loose in suspension plus my recent alignment was perfect so content. Might go to some audio guys to try and find it.he also wasn’t sure if my misaligned bonnet on right side would be fixed but did it in the end.All the parts, fluids and measurements were listed in paperwork I got - didn’t have to ask.That’s two out of two positive experiences with them. They took out a stone out of brake calliper back in March and assured me the mark in the disc would go away, which it did.Courtesy car was fiat500. Deeply flawed but I loved it. Pedals are offset - I first started it with full throttle thinking I was pressing the brake. I also thought it was diesel until I had to fuel - it hated revving (just wanted to be at 1.5-2.5k). It had carplay so it matched my Alfa for entertainment and lossless appleMusic sounded really good - at least right under the sunroof where my head was. I have pretty good ankle mobility but at max flex to use the clutch I still had to sit so far out I had to lean forward to hold non-extending steering wheel. Because you sit so far back and high sunroof is almost fully in front of you and it feels like a convertible. I really enjoyed driving it on a sunny day. They need to put them together better. Was a year old with 7k on it but it felt like it was 60k miles car. My Stelvio is same age and mileage and I bet it lives a harder life with kids and regular red lining and it feels like brand new car. I’m quite puzzled. I bet abarth is even more enjoyable as it has that farty exhaust and probably can pull."
cue2,I’ve got the Stelvio booked for service no.3 at Ancaster in a couple of weeks. I’ve used them for a few years from my first Giulietta and I think they are pretty good. Maybe I’ll get the Fiat 500. Did they have any Alfas around the place?
Deman77,"Yes. Their showroom always full of Alfas. Rosso Stelvio, green qv giulia inside - pearl white my19 giulia QV outside, mc blue giulia outside."
cue2,That’s good. They had run out of Alfas a while back to make room for the Fiats from what’s now a Renault showroom.
Deman77,Fitted new puddle lights on rear doors. The Alfa script ones I had deteriorated - the led is fine but looks like cut out that was defining the image has started degrading so some letters turned to blobs. What’s interesting is that it happened on both within a few weeks of each other some must be some common design fault.I picked up smth different this time. There is no blue ring around it - it’s an artefact from iPhone night mode.
cue2,That must be why genuine Mopar ones cost £100 or so? And I think they should be facing the other way!
Deman77,EBay jobby too but I spent double (£30) hoping these will last better. I think that is still ok even if it only lasts another year and I will try smth new.

Deman77,What are the numbers you used on the tyres? Can you post some pictures at acute angle just to see how they sit vs arch extensions.did you notice better ride from deeper tyre wall?
pocholin,"These tyres are narrower than the summer ones @ 235-55/19...but they have the same overall OD.Since it has been less than 24 hours since I put these wheels on, I haven't had a chance to test grip and cornering but it feels good thus far; however during very tight turns, there is no ugly noise and overstepping that happens with the wider tyres...much nicer on tight turns!I had taken this picture of the profile to see how much the studs stick out, does this help? or are you looking for a wider look profile of rubber vs wheel?"
Deman77,"I mean like this. From your original angle they look quite a bit in, but with 235 that makes sense. 285 vs 235 must be a good inch in vs stock. You should see a lot less spray on the side panels."

They don't look too far in actually but the wheels are not staggered (all 19x8.5) like the summer tyres.One thing I did notice is better grip coming out of a corner and heavy acceleration with temperatures around -3C. The summer tyres were losing grip while remained composed and with plenty of grip this morning. It makes sense as summer tyres don't grip well at low temps. This is the reason I swapped them now, even though we don't have snow, it is only going to get worse in Chicago (winter-morning temperatures are usually -5C to -15C in December-February)"
Deman77,Yes stock pz4 were all over the place in the wet at +5C for me last 2k of rev range in race. They need dry to maintain heat in low temp. Scorpion winters are solid in cold dry or wet and I didn’t feel much subjective drop off even into low teens dry (I am sure they are worse objectively).You need to change your car washing technique. Look at the scratches you left on the arch extension. is that a blister in the top right corner?
cue2,Those scratches could be the reflection of some lampposts?
pocholin,"Luckily, those are ALL reflections."
Muz,"Ordered some discounted Mopar rubber floor mats for the winter. I am putting so much wet mud and grass on the floor mats from walking the dog and making my mats wet and manky. Bored with drying and hoovering them.Mopar Black Friday deals started today. No idea if these have been discounted today but plenty of other stuff has been.I bought quite a few boot accessories in the last Black Friday promotion by Mopar. Really impressed by the quality, a pleasant surprise."
Deman77,I have put in the Chinese ones that go up the sides. Similar to the ones madness stocks. They are not perfect fit and I am mulling over putting poppers on them and screwing rivets in the carpet. They are holding up ok so far - about 9 months. Easy wipe with interior cleaner after a hoover. The oem mat was just getting destroyed by my right heel and it really holds on to mud. Is there a non destructive way to remove plastic mat holders? They fit better without the mats.I ordered boot liner like that as golf bag keeps shedding mud or sand and that has been in the post for ages.
Muz,"Rubber floor mats arrived today. Once again I am really impressed with the quality of Alfa/Mopar accessories these days. Perfect fit, clipped easily into the floor fixings and really solid and thick. Chuffed, just in time for the Macbeth weather heading our wayThe Stelvio name stamped into them is a bonus, just in case I forget which car I’m driving"
cue2,I think Alfa accessories have always had their high points. The old 147 roof bars were obviously studio designed and those luxury mats back then were amazing.
Deman77,Absentmindedly tried to ram a diesel nozzle into the fuel tank. Luckily it doesn’t fit.
cue2,Drove to get my booster jab.
cue2,Scary. I did the opposite with a pounds worth of petrol in my 147Q2 but it ran perfectly for a further 20k miles. They used to put petrol in diesels to prevent waxing apparently. Vary stressed for a week or two though.
manc350,"i was on a business trip in Spain a few years back and we hired a 147.. on the drive back to the airport the driver was recalling a tale where he killed a hire car in the UK a few weeks previous by putting diesel in it.. then promptly proceeded, at the last petrol station before the airport with marginal time to make the flight, to do exactly the same to the hire car...... I must admit to have PMSL as he pulled off and the car started belching smoke and bunny hopping... and then, for Karma, i missed my flight...."
cue2,We were approaching Bologna airport in our rental car and saw a rental camper van cough and splutter as it left a fuel station where it was attendant serviced furling. It didn’t make it far with the wrong stuff in the tank.

cue2,I bought a two year Mopar service plan to make the 5-3-5 into 5-5-5. Not very easy but got there in the end.
pocholin,"After a couple of weeks of driving on winter tyres I now have a better opinion on the ride:They grip amazingly well! Straight line and corners are very controlled, in fact, it is hard to brake them loose in straight line. Sliding on corners is very predictable and well controlled, so they get a 10 out of 10 in my book...being what they are, winter tyres on dry between -4C and 4C.They do feel more comfortable than the 20s because of the taller sidewall but only slightly on very ugly streets. These are the Pirelli Scorpion Winter tyres."

Zyp,"Where did you buy this from?My next service (3 year) isn’t due until next July, and I also want to get the extended warranty."
Muz,"Any Alfa dealer should be able to do it but some can be reticent. Either way you won’t be able to do it before the 3rd year after the original one expires….in my experience. I bought a January 31 2020 model and couldn’t get a quote from an Alfa dealer for a 3 year service package until Feb 01 2021 as my car had a service in Nov 20, when I bought it, unless I binned the first year of the 3 year service packageIt was a MASSIVE saving of £870 on the yearly service charges though if I paid year by year once I was able to purchase the three year package"
cue2,"I bought it from Lipscomb Maidstone. I drove there , as suggested , to give my details and the system was down so they’d call me the next day. They didn’t , so I phoned , and got an email from Thames apologising for the system being down. Ancaster weren’t prepared to sell Mopar as they have their own plan."

Muz,"If you don’t already have a plan, I’d think soHow old is your car and does it have a main dealer service history?Service Plan and extended warranty are two different things though.I have a three year warranty which expires on 31 Jan 2023. I have only been able to find an RAC extended Gold warranty for about £900 so far. Can’t see anything from Alfa that kicks in prior to the current warranty expiring."
cue2,There was a pdf of the dealer advice on selling the plans on here. It said something about being able to resell the plan to the next owner! At least that’s the way it looked.

Maximus84,Had to jump start the wife's Stelvio in her work car park today after it died and threw up a load of errors. Got it going and it's now on a long charge using a CTEK but I think the battery is toast. Probably going to get a new one in the next few days (my rear heated window may actually work after a year).
cue2,Are you an ex-pat in the US?
Muz,"Am giving the battery a boost with a Ctek, I don’t like seeing battery power at around 50% even when I’ve been driving it (short trips only)."
cue2,"I’ve written to Alfa Customer Services about the pitted rear discs advisory on the car’s first MOT earlier this week at 11,700 miles."
Maximus84,I was - lived in the States for about 4.5 years (had a Giulia for some of that time) but moved back to the UK last year.Put the battery on a full charge last night and all is well so far - all the usual error messages cleared and even the stop-start worked for the first time ever (which I then promptly switched off!).Will keep an eye on the voltage over the coming days to see if it'll hold the charge.
wictod,"The discs I just pulled off the rear were in a right state, large ripply grooves. The fronts could of gone on a lot longer, nothing wrong with them but done the lot anyway. The mechanic asked the question .. why do all these rear discs go funny on these models?"
Zyp,"As I’ve got 4 days left of self isolation and almost run out of stuff to do, I spent all day removing my wheels, clay barred, polished and waxed.Calipers too.Trying to get the old adhesive from old balancing weights was a bit of a git, but managed it.Unfortunately I couldn’t budge the front wheels - totally welded to the hubs so had to do my best gynaecologist impression and clean them through the front…Added some copper slip to the rears before refitting.Theres been a few touch ups on them prior to my ownership, and a few chips here and there so will have a refurb in the spring.Shame the parking brake looks so shite though!"

Zyp,"No didn’t see that…I gave them a good bang but didn’t want to over do the brutality with the car on a jack.The car had had new rear tyres just before I bought it, so assume that’s why they were easy to come of.Certainly don’t fancy loosening the bolts and driving it as per a suggestion in that other thread!"
Mash1138,Got the same... almost exactly (a little less miles)

makaveli144,"I have this problem, at 2700 miles and 7 months old. I will bring it up at the first service."
W1NST,I had the same problem with mine as well 3 years ago - when I questioned it the dealer replaced it at no cost to myself.
Muz,Caught a bollard on the way into my drive and made two three inch long scratches on the lower nearside rear bumper. Gutted and really angry with myself but they MAY T Cut out.
W1NST,Ouch - fingers crossed for you with the T-Cut!
manc350,"Agh, that is bad news. hope TCut does the job.. at least it is on the lower part so not as obvious maybe ?"

cue2,
manc350,now i want one....
Muz,I did until I read that if you have arthritic fingers (which I do) it’s a bit of a mare to unscrew.It’s expensive too for something that only you see

pocholin,"Installed Racechip GTS, don't know how much more power it truly makes but it is immediately noticeable more! It makes the QV even more fun! Also, I can clearly hear the turbos spooling now."
Muz,"Eventually got around to replacing the rear wiper. What a bugger it was to get off, I had to prise it off with force, with a towel between the screwdriver I wedged under it and the window. It did cross my mind that I could break the window whilst doing it. It was it was like it had been super glued.Not happy to see the spline was rusty down the bottom, which stopped it coming off easily,the car is only two years old!Obviously I oiled around the spline before refitting.What I thought would be a two minute job lasted much longer"
cue2,You changed the arm?I replaced the blade and the moulding that carries it.
Muz,"I did as I wasn’t aware I could just change the blade and moulding when I bought itAnyway I now have a spare arm to practice on the next time the blade needs replacing, maybe you should check if you can even get the arm off to see how badly the spline has rusted"

Maximus84,"Thanks. I don’t have the original service book/manual and have had a few issues with my car throwing up misfire fault codes, and an incomplete service history. Changing the plugs as per the service may help, although strangely the car has been behaving since I swapped a knackered battery for a new one..."
cue2,Battery condition seems to be the source of most issues with modern cars and if you’re not the first owner you don’t know if the car has been left unused for enough time to flatten the battery I’d imagine. They never recover and need to be replaced or they’ll discharge again.

We’ll go through Eurotunnel - Colmar - Chamonix - Alfa Romeo museum 😎 - Garda - Bari and Greece for 4 weeks. Still undecided which way back on the return trip.
MultiDoc,"I had a sudden moment of epiphany yesterday evening. Went out to check the tire depth since we’ll be doing about 5k miles in the coming weeks during holiday, to make sure it’s ok.

W1NST,Thanks.
MultiDoc,"I did in part. Had to go through Germany on the way back to get to Sqquadra Tuning (I got the exhaust sound controler installed by Stephan), so managed some quite fast stints on the autobahn but didnt maxed out as there was quite a bit of traffic and also the car was fully loaded to the brim. I had a very enjoyable 30 minute drive in northern Italy though following anothe Stelvio QV (the only QV i saw in all our traveling) and the gent was really good to follow at far from l e g a l speeds close to 200-220km/h for some time. We had a quick chat also when he pulled in for refuelling."
cue2,"The reason for the rarity of Stelvio Quadrifoglia in Italy is the tax;”The price of the stamp of an Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio is about 1,451 euros per year, but this is calculated without the superbollo. In fact, adding the cost of the supertax, the total stamp costs about 5,251 euros.”"
MultiDoc,"Yes I know, i was shocked when i found out what the road tax was in Italy ! The gentleman that was driving the silver QV told me that he's aqtually leasing it so it comes out cheaper and he avoids the exorbitant road tax. His english wasn't perfect but good enough (very raree for Italians) but that's what i could make of his description."
Deman77,"Did you do the ecu tune? If so can you do a thread with feedback on it. If not, why not?"
matty74,"Finally got round to fitting the SGW extension cables from Stuff4Car.Ordered 2 sets of cables so that the bypass can be plugged in behind the sunglasses compartment when required.Managed to remove the existing plugs with the SGW in-situ but it helped moving the infotainment unit out of the way to gain access.Some picsRemove Sunglasses CompartmentUnclip OBD socket from lower trimRemove lower trim and vent tunnelUnplug the footwell lightingLooking from underneath the SGW and plugs can be seenThe plug release tabs are on the topIt helps if you swing the infotainment unit out of the way 2 x T30 Torx. It’s then possible to reach the top tabs by reaching through the sunglasses hole whilst wiggling the plugs out (the smaller plug is the harder of two)Once unplugged, remove this cable holder with a trim tool, this can be reused to secure the new extension cables once plugged inThe existing loom was then rerouted down to the sunglasses compartment. The extension cables were routed from above to the rear of the infotainment unit. There’s a couple of holes in the steering column support bracket that are ideal for cable ties to secure.It was then possible to plug cables back together to make all good again until the SGW bypass is used.Put everything back together, reconnected the battery and cleared the errorsLooking forward to turning off the lock beeps and reducing the volumetric sensor sensitivity tomorrow. Did the same on my previous Giulia, worked a treat"
MultiDoc,"My initial plan was to do the medio tune and the controller, but in the end I chickened out of the exhaust tune to negate any possible implications (should the need arise) with warranty.Stephan is a very nice guy and at some point I’ll definitely go back to have it done.

CABBLACK,"Thks, Yes use the platform for roof makes life much easier"
Deman77,Second service today @10.5k. Engine feels noticeably smoother. I wonder if I should change the oil twice a year.They did some kind of recall software update.Last year brake pad wear was 5% at 5.8k. Now at 20%. I think discs go at roughly the same rate as pads for QV so it’s not bad unless it’s geometric progression and they will show 50% next year.
Deman77,"Swapped to winter tyres earlier this week with road force balancing. Much improved comfort in this weather.Pz4 is like wood sub 10c. Not just full lock skipping, but bumpy and harsh until they warm up. Also not good in the wet in the cold. Lost traction spectacularly in race mode on wet roundabout around 7c last Friday - not progressive, just went. Luckily it’s not a Giulia so she righted herself - but it was not a good look. In summer she would just gently step out, even in the wet and then straightens out."

Navlet,"Took the wife's Stelvio to Beechdale for the recall notice (2.2 Diesel emissions).Took just over an hour to do, not noticed any difference apart from lost phone connectivity ggrrrr"
cue2,I didn’t notice any change either when mine was done. I note Alfa etc are absent from the “did you buy a diesel in the last five years?” legal ads.
Navlet,"Did you loose your phone connection Cue 2 , after all its just a change to the engine map ?"
cue2,No change to the phone.
Isotope,I did the front brake pads today and I've got the rear mudflaps to fit! They are more plastic than rubber but lets see how they go? They look very nice with Stelvio embossed in them!!

matty74,"Eventful couple of days. Year 2 service at TJ Vickers in Shrewsbury and those fatal words “your rear pads are low” and yes the rear offside outer was 2mm.Wow hard to believe on a car not quiet 2 years old that’s only covered 11300 miles.I’ve had 2 previous warranty claims for poor discs and pads on my old Giulia and this was sure to be a warranty claim all day long as 3 other pads are all at an acceptable level for year / mileage.As the discs were all ok, I just ordered some pads while waiting for service to be finished and miraculously they arrived by lunchtime today, so I fitted them.Warranty would’ve just said, you buy the pads and we’ll provide the labour and as I’m miles from any dealer and it needed sorting asap.Anyway it was a doddle, 25 mins each side tops"
VeloceRosso,Had a new Varta AGM battery fitted.Hopefully get some peace of mind now.

W1NST,Had the rear bumper skid plate wrapped in carbon fibre effect by my local car wrapping specialist. Only charged me £40 and covered up the old scuffed silver paint nicely.Then had to drop it off at Riversway Preston for its 5yr major cambelt service - the last of the 3 year MOPAR Service plan I took out which I think was only £599 3 years ago. I’m also paying for a new water pump just to be on the safe side as I think i‘ll be keeping it for another 2-3 years as I only do about 11000 miles a year now instead of the 25000 I used to. Will post some pictures when I pick it back up.
cue2,Fitted a tiny real carbon bit in the lower spoke of the steering wheel.
David P,A thread for Stelvio owners
,
Deman77,I like them. Best part about the car. Very unusual to have wheels with smooth curves these days - they mainly cut - silver shoes it off much better. Like upgrades too.
cue2,But should I upgrade to a Quadrifoglio?
Deman77,Only if you want life without regret.
Muz,"A number of reasons I won’tI am probably too old to use the performance as it should be used, the Giulia is plenty quick enough for my driving skillsI don’t want points on my licenceI don’t want the bills for big servicesI live in an area where the traffic is so heavy I will seldom be able to floor itI don’t like the rear stepping out that I have seen on videos when accelerating in the wet, mostly because there always seems to be traffic around meHave I said I’m too old for a car like this?If I was under 50 I’d have one and to hell with what it cost to run. I’d probably drive it like a boy racer dick too.You may be a spring chicken, if so go for it😐Having said all that I am still plotting to get a French blue Alpine."
AshleyJU,"Replaced front discs and pads. Actually quite a simple process, care needs to be taken due to the fixed brake line but other than that not bad at all.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

MultiDoc,"Have been absent from the forum for the last few months, so i'll list what my Stelvio had done over the last 3 months or so.First off, managed FINALLY after lots of trouble and let downs to source and install a set of oem red seatbelts! I was a few days away from an appointment to go and have aftermarket ones installed when i fnally got word that the oem ones were possible to be had, which i promtly did. So oem red belts all around now (my wife didn't appreciate this but the kids did)Secondly I did the 5th service and the 6th is due next week actually.I also had an issue with the exhaust flaps that stopped working (they didn't open in Race mode) and after diagnostic first appointment at Mangoletsi, they diagnosis was seized exhaust valves and new complete rear exhaust box needed (the valves don't come separate), warranty took care of that (no fuss at all) only to find out after the new exhaust was installed that the valves still didn't work.... Eventually the diagnosis this time was faulty exhaust valve solenoid, again ordered under warranty and installed two weeks ago and yes finally the so greatly missed soundtrack is back !Lastly I've ordered all the bits pieces and parts needed to get the spare tyre kit, i've arranged for it to be shipped to my brother in Greece and will install it while there later this month for our holidays. Happy and extra piece of peace of mind (most probably this is terrible syntax for English)P.S: fogot the brakes, had all pads and discs replaced a few weeks ago at around 45k miles. Went again with oem, the rear discs were still good for another few k miles and so were the rear pads for another maybe 2-3k but thought i'd better do all of them together (brake fluid changed obviously and flushed too, used a couple extar bottles of fluid for the flush)"
MultiDoc,Installed the carbon arch guards today and also had the 6th service done. I ordered the rear anti roll bar drop links which I'll be replacing soon (nearside rear has a very slight play).Also booked in for the first MOT tomorrow and renewed the maps too from Alfa for another 3 years.
MultiDoc,"First MOT passed, as expected no issues and infact the tester was full of praise."
cue2,I drove to the Goodwood FOS yesterday to find Alfa had no official presence. Sad considering a visit there with hospitality from Alfa was the when I got to see the Stelvio and I was a guest of Alfa for the centenary year.
VeloceRosso,In the last week:Passed it’s first MOT 😀Had a stone chipped windscreen repaired.Yesterday she had her third service - all good.
cue2,"Saw three Stelvia in a couple of days in Spain last week, and no Giulias. Looks ok."
,
dcjarvis,"They had a couple of them at the dealers yesterday when my old man picked up his nbew Giulia Veloce (which was pretty special tbh!).It does look like a BIG car from the front, but inside feels more or less like the Giulia. Boot is a decent size (compared to my 3 series touring) but is a little bit narrow. My verdict was ""Steve"" is a good choice if you like that sort of thing..."
cue2,"Car Magazine tested it and it becomes clear why it needs to be competitively priced; the interior is not quite up to the standards of the Audi or Volvo. But it sounds like it drives well, if a little firmly, so if you actually use it rather than sit using the infotainment it could be nice."
JTD_Liam,"Is it officially launched in the UK yet? I can't tell because the offers are onalfaromeo.co.uk, but the configurator only works if you click on 'configurator' from the homepage, not if you go via the Stelvio section, and so far the only road tests have been with left-hand drive versions. And in usual Alfa fashion, next to no advertising, save for the electronic sign above the A38(M) in Birmingham, which has been closed for roadworks loads recently anyway!Despite my criticisms of Alfa as a company, the car itself looks v nice. Good that they've priced it more competitively than the Giulia. From reading the Car review it does seem like it needs to be priced a bit lower, and it'll do Alfa no harm in pricing it a bit lower to tempt people in anyway - as we've covered to death on this Forum, they simply don't have the number of ready customers or dealers to price their cars in-line with Merc, BMW etc just yet, even if they are broadly just as good - which the Giulia is, even if the Stelvio isn't quite.Price something right and you'll sell it - just look at the Nissan Juke. My Parents had one for 2 years and still to this day I dunno why there's so many on the road - it did nothing better than competitors other than it was cheaper and it's made here (which some may view as a positive)."
PapaSmurf,"The official launch is next Saturday but there are cars in (some, probably all) dealerships & orders have been open since 1st Aug."
JTD_Liam,"Ahh right, I'll cut Alfa a bit of slack for now then. But it wouldn't have hurt to give the press RHD versions for UK road testing I think. It's really not nice driving a LHD vehicle in the UK, and Alfa don't want to give journalists any excuse to get the car marked down.I've seen a couple of dealers post online this evening saying they now have their RHD cars in stock, and unlike with the Giulia it looks like Alfa has supplied more eye-catching white & Misano Blue models. Now all they need to do is a launch advert this week. Trouble is they don't have enough dealers to get too many people through the doors at once :idea:"
JTD_Liam,"I thought I'd not seen Misano Blue on the configurator. Having checked, it's not on there, but one of the dealers has a RHD one in Misano. And there was a pretty nice dark green in the brochure but that's not on the configurator either. And when you look at the Stelvio offers it says 'click here for our offer for the Stelvio Milano Edizione' but when you do it redirects to a blank pageIs it just me or does stuff like this really aggrivate!? Have they got anyone in that HQ in Slough that actually wants to be there? :curse:"
cue2,"Alfa build batches of cars to get stocks up for launch. The salesman who handed over my new Giulietta told me about the batch of blue diesel Giulietta autos with red leather the uk got sent for the latest model without asking for them. They sat around for ages, in fact I got one as a loancar recently which must have been in the showroom for a while!"
Biscione1750,At least ARUK has a configurator on its website. There are no configurators on the Australian website :disappointed:
typos1,"I think it looks way better than the awful, derivative Giulia.Luckily they kept only good part of the Giulia's styling - the front bumper, but sadly kept the awful Audi A6esque headlamps. Why is it that since the Mito, Alfa's headlamps have been so horrid ?But the rest is very 147/Giulietta like (a good thing), well apart from that fat rear bumper.If they sorted the headlights and rear bumper, removed all the extra metal in the shell they added to make it unnecessarily higher (lets face it no one takes a fake off roader off road) saving 300 kgs and making it normal car height, we d have a nice looking and driving rear/ four wheel drive hatch.I d even consider one then, well ONLY if the UK was allowed the manual."
JTD_Liam,"I can understand them building a batch of cars for launch. I just think it'd be nicer if they built them in a few different colours rather than only 1 or 2. In the case of the Giulietta facelift I could understand they wanted to show off the newly-offered 1.6 JTDm TCT, but why not do some in the new grey/blue colour and others in something else that they know would sell, like Alfa Red or Cobalto Blue? I would've considered one of those launch models, even the paint colour looked alright, but they all had the same wheels from the 2010 Veloce spec, rather than mixing it up a bit, and they all had red leather which I didn't think went with the paint. Why not use black leather which is less divisive?Same with the Giulia - the dark blue models look nice, but so do several of the other colours. Now AutoTrader's awash with dark blue diesels - the biggest oversight was possibly having only/mostly diesels - it seems on here the petrols are definitely the favoured engines. Alfa might not have foreseen that, fair enough, but they could've at least split it 50/50 petrol & diesel for the demos so there's not a glut of unwanted cars hanging around.The Stelvio approach *seems* better - some white demos & some in Misano Blue, with black leather. At least they shouldn't have a limited appeal with those. They need to get their website sorted though - too many glitches! And advertise the damn thing!"
JTD_Liam,That's shocking. I guess it's down to the Australian importer. Seems poor though

I suppose it was launched a bit before the Stelvio but I saw several on the roads pretty much straight away whereas the Stelvio is nowhere to be seen.

Another Stelvio in Palm Beach, 4 Stelvios in NYC and now just grabbed a pic of one in Boston and I only got here last night.Okay, that’s not many cars, but it’s great to see that the US are daring and probably well chuffed to buy Alfa’s again.Main point being, they look so good, you lucky folk, and I always seem to clock them even if they’re right at the edge of my peripheral vision."

The Giulia stays below £40k if you’re careful but the only good spec Stelvios are over the magic £40k where tax gets more expensive in year 2 for me. As I’ve said, my Italian friend tells me the Giulia has flopped but the Stelvio is doing OK but their tax setup is different."

lussoman,Navy blue one sat in the traffic heading into Harrogate this afternoon.
Sweeney70,Hi allsaw a red QF in Meopham in Kent last week and today saw a white one near Hayes in Kent as well.A little bit more frequent now but still pretty exclusive :rotate:
jparkin486,Passed a red Stelvio near Windermere this morning.Nice no. plate spelling A Romeo!:vs_wave:
dan_vdp,"450 miles today, Surrey to Derby and back. Not a single Stelvio (or Giulia) spotted.I did meet a forum member at Beechdale though. He recognised my number plateSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"

W1NST,Spotted my new Stelvio outside my house tonight after I picked it up from Pentagon Doncaster today. Their ex demo Speciale diesel 210 - 9 months old. Yes I know it has black alloys which most of you don’t like but I do and it would be a boring world if we all liked the same thing.
cue2,"Yeah ! What’s with the black wheels?Looks like a police car where they’ve taken the hub caps off!Seriously , it looks pretty mean like that."
markies,It looks very mean. Enjoy it?
lussoman,I'll look out for your new tank W1NST.What part of Preston are you in? Was it Walton-le-Dale?
W1NST,Yes WLD - you might have seen us around Preston before in Alfa’s with the reg W12 NST. This new one will have my other plate W1 NST on it when the V5 comes through next week. So keep your eye out for it and give me the Alfa wave! Won’t be difficult to spot - there aren’t many Stelvios around are there!
W1NST,Just realised - if your Spider is white I think I saw you going down the hill at London Road last week with the top down going towards the Capitol Centre!
lussoman,"It'll only be a matter of time before I spot you in that car! I've seen a couple in Preston - a silver one and a dark blue one, but only the once for each.Haven't noticed your number plate on Alfas in the area, but it is distinctive.Yes, that was me going down London Road taking advantage of the glorious weather! I was on my way to see a client on Hennel Lane, followed by one in Leyland."
NuovaApe,"Didn't think I'd ever ""me too"" but saw my 1st Stelvio QV in the flesh outside Tonbridge train station a few Sundays ago and I was like a boy seeing his first naked lady in a magazine. My chin was resting on my shoes.It was black and mean with those halo wheels I love and that badge of respect that makes you smile. It was perfect.The gent and I were both buying tickets from the machine and I so wanted to say ""RACE MODE?"", but decided to not waste time and go out for another look.As I walked away I kept looking over my shoulder for one last look.Only an Alfa Romeo makes you do that. Or a naked lady."

W1NST,Red Milano at Birchwood Starbucks this lunchtime. The only other Stelvio I have seen on the road in the 2 weeks I have had mine!
W1NST,Was it a red one with number plate starting S123....?
paultrim,"No, it was a blue one.I have seen a red Stelvio tho outside Starbucks, just off Birchwood, Warrington a couple of months ago, might have been the same chap"
cue2,But an Italian car outside a place serving cr@p coffee?!
W1NST,"Bizarrely, I find the Lavazza coffee at Wetherspoons for a quid is rather good!"

Mash1138,Not seen any apart from the one on my driveway!

wictod,Monte Carlo Blue mirror image of mine South Woodham Ferrers early afternoon.. Nothing for months then two within a few days
cue2,I saw a Stelvio in Kensington last week in a metallic beige which must be Imola and it looked very silky and shiny in its own special way.
jparkin486,"Belated spot, Montecarlo blue Stelvio parked up opposite the Indian restaurant I was in on thursday evening in Tewkesbury.Looked just right in front of the old architecture of the High Street."
cue2,Wasn’t me.
W1NST,Fellow Brit Stelvio today in South Brittany. Red Nero Edizione 19 plate in red - looked tasty!
fangio63,Ok - so who was it in the Red Stelvio heading up Woodbridge Hill in Guildford last night at about ten to nine..If you'd have looked in your mirrors you might have seen me ...
fangio63,And a black one next to the Asda car park Lower Earley... Bit of Alfa parking .. right on the end of the row.. Must be local to me
Oomidamon,"I saw three others over the weekend - on Saturday I was in convoy with a grey one on the M42 and A38, parked next to a red Milano in Castleton in the evening then saw a black one going in the other direction on the M42 yesterday afternoon."

wictod,Saw two down the A127 last week.. One Red West Bound at the Fortune of War roundabout and a Monte Carlo Blue West turning off the 127 for 130 towards Canvey..
cue2,Are the Fiat Tractor plant offering them as company cars?
wictod,Followed a White one off the A127 to Nevendon road.. must be a tractor factory worker finishing the late shift..
Twiss002009,Looked like a Vesuvio grey Stelvio going through Stockton Heath on the A49 about 1030 am today. I was going opposite way in a Vesuvio grey Giulia. We gave each other a little wave!
jparkin486,Saw a Visconti Green Stelvio this afternoon on the M4 eastbound near Theale.Think it needs a bit of sun on it to make it pop. Looked a bit dull under cloudy skies
Sir Baloney,"Just seen five Fiat/Alfa transporters approaching Liestal on the Swiss A2 and later on the A5 near Freiburg. Three of them had six Stelvios each in a mix of colours with some Quadrifoglios, presumably on their way to some lucky continental owners. The other two were loaded with new Pandas from Pomigliano d'Arco. Are the UK bound Giulias and Stelvios still shipped or can they come through Rotterdam I wonder? The Alfas were well protected with white sheets wheras other makes I passed were unprotected."
Nobbybm,Black QF in Sutton at Hone yesterday afternoon - stunning.
lussoman,Misano blue one parked on Cambridge Road in Lytham yesterday evening.It was dark but no mistaking that gorgeous colour.
smarty156,Red Stelvio Quadrifoglio today going past Greenhithe Asda.I was a bit slow to reciprocate the things up!I was in the red Giulia Quadrifoglio.
Mash1138,"WOW, just seen my first on the road, white (was in so much shock, didn't make the model). Traveling towards Tolworth from Surbiton. I was in the red Milano stuck in traffic going the other way"
markies,About 07:10 this morning on the A436 - it was dark but no mistaking the front end of the Stelvio
cue2,Did you see the discussion on here about the Stelvio being “bland”?I thought it was pretty distinctive too!
lussoman,That huge mouth is very distinctive for sure!
Darth Vader,Hi it was me
fangio63,2 in 2 days.. Misano QF in Maidenhead the other day whilst I was on my way to Alfa Aid with the MiTo..then a Comp Red one yesterday near Reading Uni..Thats doubled my count of QF's since I had mine in Feb..

Sweeney70,Black 68 plate on Widmore Road towards Bromley yesterday afternoon.First one I've seen for a couple of months.
Alfie155,I've seen 4 today in Lanzarote - a red and 3 white versions.Turns out you can rent them. I doubt you'd get the Alfa Wave here though.
cue2,I saw at the airport in Italy on our holiday this year we could rent a car just like ours. A week was almost into four figures.
jparkin486,Popped to the nearby garden centre in Aldermaston and there was a silver Stelvio parked up (near a white Giulietta) and then I saw a white Stelvio as I left there towards Tadley.I was in the mini so no waves exchanged with the whie one (Even I don't wave at empty Alfas in car parks)
Alfie155,"Here's one of the white ones. Assume it was a Speciale, Q4 badge and Chrome windows. It didn't move from this spot for 4 days"
Alfie155,Would that be the Aston Martin dealership off Walton Bridge? I thought they dropped the Alfa dealership a couple of years ago. The Alfa logo has disappeared from the frontage.
cue2,They still have the showroom posters judging from a LinkedIn post a while back.
W1NST,Saw a very nice Stelvio Quad as I came off M6 J29 last night. Think it was Vesuvio Grey.
wictod,Got a wave from a Red Stelvio as we passed each other on the A127 I was in the Blue one travelling towards Southend..
cue2,"At Motor Village central London,"
wictod,Cue2 you thinking about a trade in or something?
wictod,system duplicate
wictod,and another can't delete?
W1NST,That is a nice colour Cue - I hope they don’t wrap it in that hideous Jeep green colour!

cue2,"Having dropped my daughter off at school, because she’s got a really bad cold and didn’t want to miss a day, a beige Stelvio turned into the same road where the locals are overrun with girls being dropped for school.Sweeney was this your wife in the Stelvio?"

cue2,I think it’s Vesuvio Grey.
Sweeney70,"Yep, checked with the missus and she said she saw you there."

Sweeney70,"Seen two over the last week.Dark Blue one in Westminster last Tue/Wed at corner of Palace St and Victoria StAnd then a another dark one (no daylight) in Uplands, Beckenham"
markies,Green one at mid stay carpark @luton Airport on Thurs pm. I really do like the green.Then red one KR15 SFX last night again at mid stay. I recognise that plate I think ?.
cue2,I found this picture. Surprising how many have the sunroof.
lussoman,Very dark grey (charcoal) one going along Church Street in Preston City Centre this afternoon.
W1NST,Vesuvio grey I think - have seen it around Preston before.
lussoman,I think you're right.Like this one:Vesuvio Grey Metallic Stelvio Owners Pictures ThreadAlmost black.
lussoman,"Thinking about it, it may well have been black that was filthy, unless they do another really dark grey. The Vesuvio looks 'normal' grey when I do a Google Images search. The pic on the Stelvio forum seems to be the exception. It might be all down to daylight - it was a particularly murky day yesterday."
W1NST,Wasn’t ours - was cleaned on Thursday so nice and shiny at the moment.
cue2,Well it is grim up north!
jparkin486,"A red Stelvio in Hartford near Tescos. No wave from me as I was in the back of a Focus.2nd sort of spot, my mate sent me this picture from his work car park in Newbury. He's not an SUV fan nor an Alfa fan. Time for a new friend!"
Alfie155,"No Stelvios, but in one short run in Walton/Shepperton area today saw 3 Giulias and a Mito. Flashed or waved all of them but nothing back.It must be just me or is the Alfa Wave just a fond memory?"
cue2,The first owners are always less wavy. That explains the Giulias but maybe the Mito owners have different reasons.
jparkin486,Belated post as I spotted a black Steli in Aldermaston on Tuesday evening on my way to the pub. Haven't seen this one before. Teld to see the same cars on the way home/pub.The Misano guilia driver still doesn't acknowledge my wave!!
wictod,"Followed a Vesuvio Grey 18 plate with darkened rear windows round the M25 anti-clockwise near the M40 turn off as we shuffled along in the congestion, did get up next to the driver and had a glance for a wave but he either didn't see me or was not up for waveanyway was good to follow one and closely inspect the rear which I thought looked really good ( i know there's some peeps think it looks a bit ugly) but it looked great.."
Mash1138,"Not off walton bridge - lyon road, is their service location, still service Alfas and Astons."
Alfie155,"Fair enough. Actually the Walton Bridge place have/had a white Stelvio for sale, £29k for an 18 plate."
cue2,Not a “colour” I’d chose.
Mash1138,Just saw a blue 68 plate on the A3 going past Tolworth....

lussoman,"A black Stelvio, going along Pittman Way, Fulwood, Preston, at 2pm this afternoon.Was it you or the missus W1NST?"
W1NST,No it wasn’t us - there must be another black one around then. I look forward to seeing it!
cue2,I seem to recall yours can be distinguished by the black wheels?
W1NST,"Indeed, black wheels and the cherished plate W1 NST on the Stelvio and W12 NST on our Anthracite Grey Mito so us Winstones are fairly easy to spot when out and about."
alfaitalia,Thats the reason I sold my Audi A8 related plate....every bugger knew where I was .....not always what I wanted!!!....that and i had not owned an A8 for about 10 years!!
lussoman,That's quite a distinctive look W1NST - I've definitely not seen either car. I'll let you know if I do.Very few Mitos about too. A friend not far away from me in Fulwood has a metallic blue facelift one with black 5-hole wheels. Looks smart.
Alfie155,"Spotted this one on the web, hiding behind Clarkie."
cue2,I spotted one outside my house.
W1NST,"We have 2 Mitos - both 2015 Twin Air 105 bhp. The grey one is a Junior where we took the white wheels and wing mirror covers off and put on 5 hole anthracite alloys and wing mirror covers. Nice spec with the touch screen radio and factory options of cruise control and rear parking sensors. Got the upgraded sports aluminium footrest and pedals from a breaker and all that is left to do to it now Is we are getting the callipers painted red and rear windows tinted. My son will learn to drive in it from July and then he is buying it from us for £3k - half of what we bought it for last year.We did the same thing tor my daughter last year. She has a nice Progression which is the basic model but with the touchscreen radio. The first owner specced it up really nicely with factory fitted cruise control, rear parking sensors and privacy glass. We are changing the 15 alloys to the 16 old Sprint / Veloce style (got a set from a breakers and had them powder coated) which was a factory upgrade option for this model and she wants the callipers painted black.I think they are a lot of fun and great cars for the money - did 10000 miles over 6 months in the black one in 2018/19 and it was great. When my son buys the grey one from us later this year / early next year I will be getting a facelift Super or Speciale. As tempted as I am to get a 140 or 170 tct I enjoy the sound / gear changes in the Twin Air 105 so much I think will stick with that. They remind me of my of my first car, the Alfasud 1.3 ti but without the better handling or rust!"
W1NST,"Monte Carlo Blue Stelvio on Parbold Hill about 5.45pm today, I was in the Black Stelvio Speciale - sorry I didn’t flash / wave back - we were having a heated family debate!"
jparkin486,A 19 plate black Stelvio in Mortimer village this morning. Not sure of the model though.Was so surprised to see it barely got time to wave 👋
cue2,Saw my first Stelvio Quadrifoglio out of captivity this afternoon. A pearl white one in Anerley Hill.
Alfie155,"This one in Tesco, Brooklands yesterday. Not shown in the pic is the red leather. First example I've seen. Nice."

alfaitalia,"White one, a 20 plate, pulling out of Chichester Marina on Monday....had the replica race Guilia graphics like the Giulia pictured here. I felt it did not suit the Stelvio like it does the Giulia....bit OTT for an SUV!"
cue2,I’d hope it’s a wrap!
cue2,"Saw three Stelvia in a couple of days in Spain last week, and no Giulias. Looks ok."
,
alfaitalia,Looking at Im sure it was a white car with a graphics pack....not a total wrap or a paint job
cue2,I had a look at the Giulia and Giulia showcars at Geneva and they looked like they could be replicated with decals. If you wanted to.
Hamfisti,"Black quad on the Crawley road in Woburn yesterday - sounded great. I was walking rather than in my Giulia, so didn’t risk an Alfa wave."
cue2,We were returning from a weekend in Bath and drove for quite a few miles behind a 2017 Stromboli Speciale on the M4. Would usually have had the same bike rack on ours but not at the moment.
Mash1138,Black Stelvio - Surbiton yesterday early morning (07:30).

JTD_Liam,"Brand new 70 plate Stelvio in Misano Blue with black alloys (think it'd be Veloce) on the A40 between Eynsham and Witney in Oxfordshire this afternoon (26th Sept) around 3:45pm.Was good to see a brand new one as the newest I can recall seeing lately have been 68 plates and possibly a 19 plate, but no 69 or 20 plates."
jparkin486,"2nd spot of same car in 2 days. A Montecarlo blue Stelvio on a private plate with black miliano wheels in the village.Also the estate agent seems to have a black GT now. What with a black Brera in the village too, maybe Alfa is slowly taking over Bramley 😊"
Mash1138,"White 19 plate in basement car park Waitrose, Surbiton. Just now...."
jparkin486,Black Stelvio by Theale station this morning. Lady driver looked a little non-plussed at the headlight flash and wave from me!
cue2,I found that you have to wait a while before drivers of each model think of waving. It was quite a while with the Giulietta. I don’t wave at the other Stelvio round here if I see we are both dropping our daughters at school as I know the lady driving it would think I was trying to make her aware of a flat tyre or something like that. The second owner may well wave.

Mash1138,went past dark grey heading down A3 today.
W1NST,I would go with Stelvii as well I think.
cue2,Where to in these days of lockdown?
W1NST,The end of my driveway and back of course!
cue2,Be careful out there.
Deman77,Saw one in my golf club Saturday. The driver seemed a bit shocked and disappointed- was not responding to my eager waving. Think he was hoping to be the quirky one in the car park - though it is grey - and now it’s a common car with my qv on the other side in bright blue to add insult to injury. Even the Ferrari is grey in my club car park.On the way to testing facility today saw the Aston suv the one with the Mercedes engine coming alongside in my door mirror. Grey of course. It just looks like another Ford suv - I know Ford stole the Aston look but still why would you make new car for 150k that can be mistaken for a Ford.
cue2,You could always get a Rolls Royce Cullinder SUV and be mistaken for a cab driver.
lussoman,Black one on the A6 at Fulwood heading towards Broughton roundabout. 11am-ish yesterday.

alfaitalia,70 plate Stelvio Quad parked in Sainsbury's car park in Chichester....man diving with boy in passenger seat. Looked pretty clean.....gun metal grey....which didn't do much for it IMO....sorry if you are on here...just my opinion!.....nice looking car though and only the second Stelvio Quad I've ever seen!
Muz,I agree re the colour but this does seem to be a very trendy colour these days on high end cars
alfaitalia,....yep......at least it was not the primer grey I see everywhere that makes cars look like an unfinished Airfix kit....I really detest that colour and fail to understand it's popularity!....each to his own I guess.
jparkin486,"I believe that colour is called ""crayon""! Which is odd as crayons come in many colours!!I have a mate who wanted his A4 in that undercoat beige! He saw sense and went for white, although it was still an A**i"
cue2,“man diving with boy in passenger seat.”?sounds worrying.
Deman77,When it just been cleaned and is in the bright sunshine that colour looks good as it picks up whatever other colours are reflecting in it and the flake pops. Quite specific conditions and outside of them it is hard to make it work. Even a light film of dust or grime that is not really visible outside 6ft kills that effect off.On Stelvio it’s even more important because unlike most Suvs it has lots of curves in body panels. Those really benefit from glazed look (which clean grey will give you) or any kind of colour fade (you need light metallics or coloured flake in monochrome for that). I also think it has to have dark wheels and dark callipers with monochromes because any bright colour creates too much contrast and ruins the effect.I washed my sister-in-law’s year or so old q5 in that colour yesterday and it looked like a total binner dirty but once cleaned it was really quite impressive in the sun - totally different car. Cloud covered the sun and it was back to the “unfinished scale model car” look.
cue2,Blu Montecarlo is pretty amazing too when you get the mica flip going on.
lussoman,"Silver one on Cumeragh Lane, Goosnargh, this afternoon."
Muz,"White 20 reg in Ferring this morning, driven by a woman, I was about to flash and wave and then remembered I was in the 159.Brings it to a total of 3 or 4 that I’ve seen since early November. Sad given how many Qashias,, Kias, Hyundais, Macans, Audi, Merc, Peugeot and BMW SUVs I see every day. Great to have an unusual car but not good for Alfa"
dsmithgt2,Spotted a Black 202 QV heading into Maynooth village this afternoon. It's only the second time I've seen a Stelvio QV in Ireland.
alfaitalia,Dont let that stop you!!......I wave at other ALFA owners no matter what model they drive.........I only feel awkward when I forget that I'm not in my 159 and I'm in a company Isuzu/Ranger/Astra/Golf!!!
Muz,"Two yesterday, a White one and a Competizione Red one, both ignored my flash and wave"
lussoman,Black one on Preston Road between Grimsargh and Longridge yesterday morning around 9am.Looked like it'd just been washed.
jparkin486,Not quite spotted but I had an hour alone with this beauty yesterday!! 280 bhp Ti. Me likey 😍
cue2,Nice wheels
cue2,Really not sure about white Stelvios for some reason though.....unless you’ve paid the deposit!
jparkin486,"^^^ deposit hasn't been paid!! ( maybe, maybe!!) I do like the Stelvio in white. They had a white QF in Thames Alfa that looked spot on."
cue2,"Saw three Stelvia in a couple of days in Spain last week, and no Giulias. Looks ok."
,
lussoman,"The contrasting black bits definitely help it, especially that rear. And those black alloys give it a better, meaner look."
Deman77,Qv in white is a super look. The white painted bumper stripe around the exhaust tips really pops and the coloured arch extensions work great. Generally I find Ti is a better shape than QV (qv is too wide and hatchbacky from many angles) but I liked Ti better in other colours. Think white creates too much contrast with non-painted bits and exaggerates them.
lussoman,"An all-black one, including wheels, descending the steep part of Berry Lane, Longridge, as I was ascending it on my push bike. 3pm this afternoon."
cue2,"There , that’s the same scale now"
jparkin486,"A black Stevlio, complete with two bikes on the roof rack, heading south on the M3 towards Winchester this morning."
Deman77,Black QV with black wheels in the usual rush hour queue northbound out of Epping high street. Had to look at the exhaust tips to tell it was a QV. It probably looks more distinct when stationary and you can see the emblem and the bonnet vents but coming the other way all you see is a black Stelvio.
jparkin486,MC blue Stelvio heading south on the M3 this afternoon. Waves from me heading north 😊
Anticlockwise,"A whole generation of lost Trainspotters, now find an outlet for their passion. Which one represents the Flying Scotsman, or indeed the Mallard?Come on guys, get a life - tear an Alfa engine apart to see what’s different from the rest, before it’s too late!"
jparkin486,Well I spotted The Flying Scotsman on Sunday too if that's better for you.
cue2,Did you see any ducks?
jparkin486,Only seen a duck in the Railway Museum 😂
cue2,Mallard?
jparkin486,👍
Muz,"Red QF with no front number plate at a roundabout near Rustington, pulled on behind me and followed for about a mile before turning off. Nice to see another Stelvio in the rear view mirror"
Mash1138,"Blue one passed me near Surbiton health centre, quick flash from me got a nice wave back"
VeloceRosso,Seen three in the last few days.Red one like mine in Matlock Bath on Saturday afternoon.Metallic blue Veloce Ti in Woodhall Services yesterday - nice colour!Another red one M1 northbound near Leicester this afternoon.Maybe these great cars are becoming more popular!
GVblue,"Including ours, there are to my knowledge, three red Stelvios in the Matlock/Matlock Bath area. There are also two MC blues ones, a green one and a white one. Not too surprising as we are only ten miles from Beechdale.We are currently on holiday in Northumberland and yesterday afternoon, just outside Rochester, we got a wave as mad as ours from a couple in a red Milano. A mile further down the road was a middle aged lady in an MC blue Stelvio who clearly wondered what the hell was wrong with us. I guess people in red cars are just a little more extrovert than those in more reserved colours.If ever you pass us, in either our Stelvio or Giulia, I can guarantee you some mad waving."
RJS463,"On the way out of Arlesey Bedfordshire we passed a misano blue stelvio, the driver gave a wave, happy days. Then, later this afternoon driving out of Lincoln, a wave from a very nice grey Giulietta Veloce."

dsmithgt2,"182 (68) reg Red QV currently being driven like it's stolen (probably has been) by a young lad not older than 21 alongside Merlin car auctions in Naas , County Kildare. Second QV I've spotted in Ireland along with a black one in another Kildare town, Maynooth. Probably sent to Merlin's to be auctioned by the big Joe Duffy Group who likely took it in as a trade in."

lussoman,"A dark blue one on Whittingham Road, Longridge this afternoon. Sounded like a tractor; plenty of real tractors around that area as well."
W1NST,Treated yourself to new alloys Cue?
cue2,Yes
W1NST,"Look great, I’m thinking of changing mine as well. Have you noticed much difference on the ride quality going from 19’s to 20’s?"
cue2,The ride quality suffers but the car is even more responsive. Having silver 20” wheels makes the Speciale look great and the wheel size isn’t lost by being the same colour as the tyres.
W1NST,"Nice, I’m thinking of getting the black 20s they put on the Speciale now as they are broken up a bit by the diamond cut edges / borders."
cue2,"I’d never have machined-face wheels again as they deteriorate , sometimes under the lacquer. I don’t like the look of them with the form of the Stelvio either. Too sharp and fiddly looking for my tastes."
W1NST,"FairPlay - each to their own, it would be a pretty boring world if we all liked the same thing. Doing a bit of cycling down in Dorsey at the moment by the way and managed to find a really good Thule A Frame mounted bike rack for the caravan to transport the Titanium Tourer on:"
cue2,Nice bike.
W1NST,"Thanks, Dolan titanium frame with Campag Chorus 12 Speed and 32 hole Campag Record Hubs on H Plus Son Archetype Rims finished off with Deda Super Zero Bars & Stem. Everyone else I ride with is on Shimano or SRAM now but I am still sticking with Italian like the cars.Treated myself last year as a mixture of 50th and redundancy pay off after 20 years then getting a new job straight away, Not as fast as my full carbon bike but way more comfortable and the panniers come in handy. Where did you end up buying your new alloys for the Stelvio from please?"

cue2,I saw a 70 plate black one last week in the traffic in Chelsea. The regional bit of the plate was possibly Portbury so a Fiat U.K. car?
alfaitalia,Black 21 plate one.....being winched onto the back of a rescue truck at about 9.45 this morning on the M27.....sorry if that was you!
cue2,The customer service guy who came to recharge my Stelvio’s battery which was flat due to Covid lack of use told me he’d never been out to a Stelvio to recover it.

Me I’d be fine if the whole town drove misano blue QVs - I’d get to listen to the exhaust when I go for a walk instead of a distant rumble from the boot in mine.
Mauryk,"I have a comp red Stelvio. Pulled up next to a comp red Giulia at a stoplight. From the right comes a comp red 4C and turns down the road ahead of us. Three competizione red Alfas, different models, in the intersection at the same time!I thought I was in an Alfa commercial."

Per1,Not seen another Quadrifoglio (Stelvio or Guilia) in my neck of the woods (Stevenage) and not seen one on my commute down to Borehamwood. I think I've only ever seen 2 Stelvio Quads on the roads in the past couple of years - one was just pre-lockdown in Cheddar Gorge and the other was around Easter this year near Cambridge.Love the uniqueness of them and that they are not common as AMG Mercs or BMW X3/5 M models!

Muz,Black every day for me
Andy1671,I was thinking about getting my wheels powder coated in black I have a 2018 Monte Carlo blue Milano with black roof rails and the black window surroundsthe same wheels as the one above might go down the black tailgate badges road as well
cue2,oh no. Someone’s nicked your wheels!
cue2,"Anthracite is better than black, I feel."
Muz,Some of us like under stated others prefer bling(open goal there for you with the colour of the car though!)
cue2,"Saw three Stelvia in a couple of days in Spain last week, and no Giulias. Looks ok."
,
cue2,Are you saying my “wheel silver“ wheels are bling?perhaps a more understated body colour works better with dark wheels!
Muz,"I was, but I was only joking. Your car looks very classy.I have a black 159 and a black 968 and I have had enough of trying to keep on top of keeping them looking shiny and clean, so I decided my next car would be a bright colour, no blacks or dark blues. Having had loads of Alfas but never a Rosso one it was a no brainer when this Stelvio came up. It is possibly too loud but I love it and it doesn’t show dirt anything like my black cars.Anyway, yes my personal preference on wheels is black, although my other cars all have silver wheels!"
cue2,👍I‘m a big fan of Rosso Alfa too. Both of my Giuliettas were solid red. In fact the first Stelvio I saw parked in the U.K. was that colour so the scale thing confused my eyes a bit. The 147 Q2 I had before the Giuliettas was Nero carbonio and at least the metallic camouflaged the initial dust landing on it!
Andy1671,Trawling around the tinterweb I'm almost sure the wheels will go to gloss black along with the rear badges but then the exhaust tips will need to be gloss black also could be a bit of a rabbit hole but that should be all the modifications done and dusted and they're only slight mods anyway
Alfie155,"Visited a few Italian ports on a cruise last week, expecting multiple Stelvio sightings but they seem to be just as rare as in the UK. However there were 3 on the ferry between Messina (Sicily) and Villa san Giovanni.Oddly I didn't see any in Roma or Genoa.However this Quad looked at home parked by the harbour at Monte Carlo"
lussoman,"^^^That's not a Quadrifoglio, is it? Looks a bit plain, but I'm no expert. Lots add the cloverleaf badge."
Muz,Not an expert either but aren’t all QFs colour coded without that nasty black trim on the wheel arches. Too much chrome around the windows and grille? Maybe European models are different to UK spec?
cue2,Right about the missing window surround brightwork. A good costsave but the grille on the Quadrifoglio had bright finish at launch.

VeloceRosso,A set of genuine Alfa valve caps 😀I’ll probably save them until spring though.
cue2,Careful you grease them to prevent them corroding on. I had some and only noticed they’d been nicked when I mentioned them to the dealer at a service. They said I was probably saved from an unlucky ending as they’d had to saw the things off customers cars when the metal reacted with the valve stem.
Muz,"I bought some of these Alfa valve caps a year ago. Put them on in April, took them off and replaced them with the rubber ones at the end of October.They are the only Alfa accessory I’ve bought for the Stelvio that disappoint me. Two of them were tarnished after 6 months"
VeloceRosso,"Yes - thanks for that. I always put a smear of grease on these things (I have them on the bike and wife’s car). So far, no dramas 🤞"
Muz,"A stupidly expensive key cover at a bargain rate off Ebay, it is OEM too."
Zyp,Just bought a short front number plate plinth.
cue2,I don’t regret buying my Stelvio a Blu Montecarlo ready for the handover three years ago. Much nicer than the std black one.
cue2,I just want one that’s vertical instead further forward at the top. How much was the short one?
Zyp,Was about £30 inc delivery.Will fit my 5 digit reg nicely
cue2,I think I might buy a normal width one to see how it could be made more vertical. The lower edge is set by the cone of the parking sensor.
pocholin,"Cargo dividing system, same as the Jeep. I also got the sliding mounting blocks that do have Alfa's logo in them in monochrome, they look nice."
Muz,Got bored with useless Alfa customer service trying to exchange a black Friday deal on spare bulbs with a non functioning light up box. I am not going to be changing bulbs in the dark so I’ll just accept defeat and keep them. Life’s too short to worry about things that I don’t need over the principal.

Zyp,Ordered some black badges for the rear.Just need to work out how to fit them straight….
cue2,You could make a cardboard jig based on the existing badge before you remove it.
Deman77,Found a break between the spittle to give her a good wash. Wasn’t very dirty from pre Xmas wash with most of the car still beading very well but the boot door and rear bumper always get so much spray and once things dry (think happened once for a day in the last month) will look awful. it looks like things will dry out for a week after today. It’s not fitting to be mucky.I have now given up on contactless wash after trying different foams and pre washes. It may work for uncoated cars with more aggressive foams. For coated car it is possible but it actually takes longer because you need to be very thorough with pressure washer not to miss any bits because if you are at the wrong angle or too far it just does not remove the road film and it uses twice the water. With mitt it’s almost impossible to miss anything and rinsing need not be too thorough. I stills spray mild prewash before I start setting everything up and rinse of muck before touching her but it’s all a lot less involved and quicker too. Plus ceramic definitely beads better after mitt than even the best of my contactless efforts.
Deman77,Wait this is a stuff thread. Sorry. Wrong number.

Deman77,Were they QV specific or generic?
pocholin,Generic. I will have to make a couple of cuts to the front ones to make them fit. The rears will be easier. I'll post pics once done.
Deman77,I tired standard on mine. Was not a good look for QV and functionally was inadequate because was not wide enough. after failed attempts to make my own I decided to just wash more frequently and live with extra stone chips.Hope the ones you got will be better.
pocholin,"The QV ones do look like don't work that well and that's why I decided to make my own. I have been washing often but I also want to get a different look.

Oxford Exile,Hello all… first time post… first time I have owned an Alfa…. Absolutely love my new Stelvio QV. I am looking for a recommendation for a back seat cover..

Muz,"Put the dog in the boot on a boot liner?That’s where my Miniature Pinscher goesWelcome btw, fabulous first Alfa"
pocholin,"LOL, my dog HATES the boot, she always manages to jump to the back seat and sometimes to the front. Oh well, seats clean easily."
Oxford Exile,He hates the boot! He’s a miniature schnauzer … so not a big dog. Thanks for the welcome Muz…. really pleased with the motor… that exhaust sound is totally addictive!
Oxford Exile,Lol… The muddy paw prints aren’t what I really worry about… it’s the claws scratching the leather that’s the issue. My dog sliced through the leather in my Volvo XC90 with his paw before I got a seat protector.
Deman77,The centre of rotation in QV is around where the bum of the driver and front passenger is. So if you drive her as intended the dog’s preferred place would be the front seat.
Muz,"Surely there’s a dog guard for the boot designed for a Stelvio? No way would I put up with that!My dog hated the boot for about three days but jumps in and now waits whilst the boot opens and isn’t allowed out until she has a lead on. It was a bit of a drama for a few days but worth it. A nice soft dog bed helpsI admit to being a bit anal about my car interior though, I don’t even let people/kids eat in it"
pocholin,"LOL, I'm pretty relaxed about eating and the dog. I don't like the interior to get dirty but, if it does, it is okay as well...it can be cleaned.I remember my 6 or 7 y/o throwing up all over the back seat of a 1999 Benz E55 back in 2000 or 2001 and he was all worried because he thought I would be mad...I was disgusted by the vomit and sorry for him but, again, it wasn't a big deal, take the seat out, lots of rags, water and vacuum cleaner...not a big deal cleaning the mess (other than almost throwing up a couple of times because of the smell!).I don't bring the dog too often in this car, so I'm not investing on a net, guard or something similar."

Deman77,"Bought new prewash, shampoo, iron and tar removers.also got a dedicated corded mini drier to replace my battery leaf blower - very awkward and hard plastic nozzleAlso was looking for alternative way to wash - I’m on 2 bucket with a mitt but I keep finding some areas of car do not bead water perfectly, sign of contaminated ceramic. I don’t like the idea of applying more elbow grease with the mitt. found this alternative that I will switch to - seems cleverer - basically use a load of small 40x40 drying mf towels (450gsm) in a bucket of soapy water. You will only use each once and discard. Take out of the bucket, fold in 4 - washing stroke, flip - stroke, refold - stroke, flip - stroke, discard, next towel. Can be done 8 times if it’s fluffy on both sides but most have short pile on one side. I just bought 10 for 30 from bulk supplier. I imagine 6-7 will do the stelvio and and 3 the i3.Though technically when folded it will be the same size as the mitt the contact patch is much larger than with a mitt plus you will be going with clean microfibre every time so it should have more cleaning effect with no extra pressure.My post carwash mf wash cycle is always half empty so now it will be full."

MultiDoc,Was thinking about this for quite a while but finally got a new gear shift lever for my Stelvio. It’s the newer style leather one with red stitching. I’ll be doing the swap in a couple of weeks.
cue2,"I’d check the thread on Stelvioforum. I’m sure somebody said it not just a simple swap. If it is , get me one."
sloef,You can order these in Italy (Facebook group or ENG has them as well) already programmed for about 200 euros. I did and the actual swap takes about 15 minutes (longest bit is prying the centre console cover off its clips). Looks great!
MultiDoc,"It came preprogrammed ready to fit and go. It’s just 4 x 10mm nuts to fit. No programming or any electronic wirzardry required and no faults etc. Haven’t done the swap myself yet (shifter arrived today at my brothers in Greece and will do it when we arrive) but a good friend did it only a few weeks ago with no issues in 10 minutes. I can message you the sellers info if you want, I paid 230€ for it. By the way, if you want you could order it and have it sent to my Greek address and I can bring it back for you mid August to save import tax vat etc if you like."
Deman77,Got the Italian front plate mount. That was the easy bit.now need to convince the missus of the merits of spending 250 quid on the cheapest 5 character plate as 7 is too long.
Deman77,Got the new reg. Ordered new plates.This is how standard vs short one compares. It’s not something you thought you needed until you realise how much the standard mount blocks out.
cue2,"The thing that gets me is the way it’s angled down, moved back at the bottom, to avoid confusing the parking sensors. The thing should be thinner at the top to make it vertical, in my opinion."
Deman77,Just saw a veloce parked. I see what you mean. Looks broken. QV holder is straight whether standard or short.
cue2,I might have to buy a plate frame and try to cut it to be vertical.

,
Navlet,Good things come to those who wait. Welcome to the fold.
Welshrugby,Ordered early august but delivery december :-(Nice review:
Deman77,"+1 late convert. +1 SQf on order. I’m downsizing from a-hem Volvo XC90 - kids are not toddlers any more and I do not need the massive boot. Will just stick a roof box on top of stelvio when needed and save half a ton of weight all the other time. Giulia would have been my choice for better looks, ride quality and dynamics but was vetoed.Noise and performance of the Qf setup aside, absolutely loved the driving ergonomics and understated look of the Stelvio and did not mind the minor shortcomings enough. I felt all the important things were right - not right better than anywhere else.Also ordered early Aug - been told mid Nov but potentially late Oct. It was not an existing slot (the dealer had them but the factory wouldn’t even allow colour change and I wanted to strip all the usual shouty bits too) so will not know exact build time till two weeks before it takes place (been told this is the Alfa way) but they seemed pretty confident with the timings.Perhaps yours is one of those new colours?"
Welshrugby,"I never test drive my cars, just read the reviews and so impressed with my Giulia Veloce I just knew the Stelvio Quad would be awesome. I have four kids but all grown up now so don't the luggage space but i can now keep all my tennis gear in the boot permanently. I have gone for a bog standard spec 2020 model. The dealer tried to tempt me with a 2019 model with had tri coat red and a sunroof, flashy steering wheel and some other bits but to be honest, I wanted the newer model with some of the improvements internally. I have it on a 4 year contract lease, I normally only lease for 2 years as I get bored but how can you get bored with this? so a 4 year lease and have chosen the dark metallic grey, vesuvius I believe. Wife has a red Audi Q3 so had to choose a different colour.I reckon they have said December and then will bring that forward. I may roll the Giulia contract till then or drive a corsa 1.2SRi or a kangoo van and then REALLY notice the difference.I am tempted to fit the little kit that keeps the valves open in all driving modes"
Deman77,"Keep the Giulia and then do like for like write straight after when the memory is fresh.my19 could be had about 5k cheaper unregistered so it was tempting but they do all kinds of undocumented improvements between model years plus there are plenty of unbounded changes. Now to your liking I think you will be able to have exhaust open at all revs in D mode. That is the talk in yank forums. It really is a special sound.I was tempted by the sunroof as it is quite dark inside with small windows and they flat out refuse to untick the tinted rear windows. I didn’t want the extra 200 odd pounds of extra weight at the highest point of the car. If it was just non-opening panorama I would have gone for it as that would be a bit lighter but it is a split opening one which cuts quite a bit of light and one more thing to go wrong. Plus at 6’2” I am uncomfortably close to headlining in the car with a sunroof.The dark wheels are better at hiding the gap in the wheel arches but they also hide how nice looking the wheel design is. Plus silver makes it that little less aggressive looking.I didn’t like the green white stitching and wife hated red so it’s the standard grey for me.Alcantara wheel on demo car felt worn with 10k on the clock so that was not getting ticked.Bucket seats are a no with small grubby feet kicking the back of them.The tricolour red looks a bit dark in cloudy conditions and I didn’t like it enough to argue and it is silly cost especially as they make plastic bits look different shade from metal - it’s the same on white pearl though the car looks stunning in that colour.In the end it’s just the driver assist pack, upgraded stereo, roof bars, boot socket and the clown blue paint for us. Rest standard.I do like how you can make it very aggressive looking with choice of paint, callipers and dark wheels if you wanted to. 9 out of 10 will be specced that way so mine will just look like bog standard stelvio I hope."
Welshrugby,"close now, should be within the next two weeks"
Deman77,Let’s hope we can take delivery before things get locked down again.
markies,Welcome to the fold.I'm insanely jealous but in a nice way
Welshrugby,"It's a massive treat to myself, have loved my existing Veloce. Just looking at the exhaust flaps controller by ALH, tempted"
Deman77,it’s included. They should stay open in D in low revs. Not sure if it’s a menu option but according to US forum it’s been available as a software update for late my19 Qf in the US and is standard in my20.

Deman77,According to discussions on US forums late MY19 onwards software allows for open valves possibility (probably from menu) in D regardless of revs. So unless you are after loud cold starts you should not bother with valve mod.
Welshrugby,I am picking up my Stelvio Quad next mondayso you think I can program that change myself from within the car setup software?

My dealer has lots they were waiting to deliver and I am not in a rush as my detailing is not till 16nov. Naturally I will pick up first chance I get though.Yes I expect there is a setting for it in software.Do 2019 Stelvio QVs allow you to open valves in “D” Mode?I know that the 2020s have the option to open the exhaust valves for louder sound in “D” mode (as well as “Race,” of course). I thought I read somewhere that there was a software update for the 2019s that made this possible as well. Can anyone confirm?www.stelvioforum.com"

Done around 24 miles and average 13.9mpgwill blast off home in the dark and perhaps settle down next week to try and eak out 20mpg, that may take some feathering.Still interested if it can be programmed easily to have valves open in N and D modes, asked the dealer to check"

punkatron1,Yeah cruise at 70 and efficiency mode.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Deman77,"very nice. No sunroof I see. I had to fight my lot to lose sunroof. It’s quite dark in the back without and Alfa would not delete tinted windows but it’s so far back from the driver that all I get is less headroom plus the weight, plus extra road noise, plus a leak or a rattle at some point.My fave colour was trofeo white. That’s what I test drove and it was stunning. That was vetoed. I wanted silver and quite liked the grey but all monochromes were vetoed. Reds were non-metallic and looked dull when not in sunshine and between two metallic blues that were left the light looked happier on overcast day. So wasn’t much of a choice.I think white is the only one that must have dark wheels. Everything else looks great with both. I think dark wheels hide the excessive arch gaps better, but light show off the stunning wheel design better. The only thing with light though I think painted callipers detract from it. So I think dark wheels plus callipers or light wheels and don’t paint callipers and that’s personal taste between those two. I think if they smoked the headlights then dark wheels would have been a must. Think the dark wheels could have been less dark too.Are you going to change the boots over winter?"
Deman77,Don’t think it’s good for that engine to be at working low revs for long periods anyway. I also will never “A” it unless I have to for grip purposes. That cylinder deactivation sounds like a long term problem.
Welshrugby,"You shouldn't buy a car like this for the economy I agree but old habits die hard and part of the enjoyment is enjoying both extremes. I won't be using ""A"" until fully run in and then only really on long motorway runs to try an eke out some extra miles. This is a lease car for 4 years, i normally have them for 2 years but on the basis I won't get bored of this car, i chose the 4 year option. I still like to treat engines nicely whilst cold on start up even if I don't own it.I often take a standard spec car to be honest, I had sunroofs before but rarely used them. Love the pan roofs on some cars but too tight to spec it. I only got the metallic because I drove a hard bargain with the dealer and he threw it in. I may have that open valve mod done sometime but to be honest, if you boot it in N mode, it still makes a special noise.Drove to work this morning on country roads and found myself behind a range rover sport svr. Must have been a lady driver, no acceleration away from junctions, probably no idea of the performance under her bonnet. Let my wife drive my 740d once and slipped it into sport mode. She still took about 12 seconds to get to 60 :-("

Deman77,"I think you get a sub regardless. So the mat “without sub” might be wrong.

Deman77,Opinions are split on whether HK is worth it. So you shouldn’t regret it. Some people prefer the standard which is not cheap by any means in QV - they list it as 11 speaker sound theatre blah blah. I liked the HK in the demo I drove so I ticked it but I don’t think it’s that much of an upgrade.You do need to mess around with settings probably as with HK at least the default is putting too much into front so people fade it to rear a few clicks and increase lows and highs.
Welshrugby,Is that a sub woofer on the side then
Welshrugby,A bit dirty but these are the standard alloys and brake calipers. Just driven to Nottingham and Back from Northampton and would have got 27mpg had I not blasted back the last 10 miles so 26mpg. Not bad considering i never touched the efficiency mode
Deman77,Mine are the same. Picking upMonday. I never washed my previous grey cut wheels - they looked better dirty. These have to be washed but the shape seems super accessible. The only trouble i imagine is break dust - and there will be lots.Having mine coated with some mumbo jumbo high temp blah coating that should repel break dust. Them and the exhaust tips too. Let’s see if they fare any better then yours over time.no cure for kerbing though. But I think these will wear kerb marks better then the dark ones.

,
Welshrugby,My dealer suggested that the Stelvio Quad engine is pre run in. I am not so sure myself so will try to follow some of the guidelines laid out her in the Stelvio owner handbook
Deman77,I like how after 300 miles you do not need to respect speed limits. If you get nicked just show them the manual
punkatron1,Mines on a lease so I completely disregarded the running in period. A bit naughty but I couldn’t resist.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Deman77,I can’t resist. Reading those instructions it seems like it is as much to do with driver getting used to the car and making sure nothing is loose or bad on delivery as running in the the car. I don’t see where you can accelerate repeatedly legally other than on track. This thing goes to legal limits in like 2 seconds when you leave town. I will change oil after winter which will probably be less than 1k miles but other than that just not rev past 3k till warm and no labouring in low revs. Those are the two killers no matter the engine or age.
Deman77,My first problem.Do you guys find the car too quiet inside. I was pleased with low road noise and just a hint of wind noise on the motorway journey after I picked it up but now driving around in D valves open (says so on mode info screen) I can barely hear anything - just a distant hum. Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice change from my tractor of a diesel Volvo which also sounded like it was running inside the car but here it’s nothing and the noise was one of the main reasons I bought this thing. I remember it sounded to die for from outside with open valves and I think the one I test drove did not lack for noise inside though I suppose it was less hushed on the motorway for noise. I didn’t complain just going 50-70 and back down in race mode like an idiot for 20miles. But don’t seem to get any of that in my MY20. But I was hoping to hear open valves all the time. Did they neuter them with their refinement efforts? Could it be in run in mode for exhaust? It definitely farts on high rev gear change but everything sounds very distant and hushed. I didn’t buy it to bother other people - I want to listen to it but I cannot hear much. Do you open windows to hear? Should stereo be on to get the engine noise supplementary noise? I will listen outside tomorrow perhaps my flaps are not open.
Welshrugby,"It's a pussy cat noise wise driving it in N and even D and behaves. Unless you have Alfa Red or some exotic colour, you won't even get many admiring glances or comments in the car parks of various supermarkets. A mate of mine professed to love alfas and loved the look of my veloce. He said, i prefer the sporty look of the last car you had when looking at the Stelvio. I put him right of course.But those that know their cars will know it is an absolute beast. I didn't fancy a porka with a whale fin or a audi r8 or something that stands out too much, or a range rover, toerag, merc amg etc etc, but this machine is so understated but as you well know, a complete riot. Slip it in race when possible and enjoy the chaos, but be damn careful you don't fly through a hedge when all the traction is off.We have done our homework, we have superb motor vehicles, inner enjoyment for us and admiring glances/conversations from the inner circle."
Deman77,So you think it’s lying about open valves in D? Let me check today.
punkatron1,"Maybe it is a colour thing. Mines Alfa red and it gets lots of admiring glances and also a few photos. Amusingly I’m even in one of those YouTube car spotter video things.You could always do the exhaust mod mentioned previously where you take both vacuum hoses off the exhaust and plug them.I’ve done this and I think mine sounds decent in fairness. Although the wind noise is horrendous on the motorway, so the MY20 seals might be blocking out lots of your sound.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Welshrugby,"The noise on mine stays the same in N and D so only Race when it is audibly different. Mind you, it crackles, bangs and makes good noise in all modes when accelerating hard. I was thinking about having the key fob mod done by the alfa tuners for £320 to open the valves in all modes"
Welshrugby,https://www.giuliaforums.com/forum/...qv-exhaust-modification-race-mode-active.htmlbut prefer the option below. I have it on lease for 4 years so well worth the spendhttps://www.ahmotorsports.co.uk/product/alfa-giulia-quadrifoglio-exhaust-flap-control
Deman77,"it has to be an error or some run in thing. If you look in car info page - D says the valves are open. I also would not say that D is particularly keen to shift down - you have to really ram the gas in, I would have thought it would be keener - throttle stab means shift down, not just full throttle. So I suspect it is using N settings for engine and gearbox. I will wait till the 1500mile manual mark before I moan to the dealer but I am hoping 500 is the magic number before it opens up in D. The folk in the colonies did not complain when they upgraded their my19 D mode to MY20 settings to get the valves open so it has to work.I will check Race today to see there is more noise coming into the car."
punkatron1,Mines due a service so I’ve just undone the exhaust mod. Sounds plop now. My neighbour seemed pleased though.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
aspender,My MY20 quad is now just over 1000 miles in and there’s definitely a positive audible difference in D versus N. Even at 10-30mph accelerations. It’s all very subjective though.
Welshrugby,"Interesting. From all the reviews i have read, the valves are only open in the race mode. If you start the engine, scroll the and scroll to the mode settings, A is definately valves closed, as is N mode. But moving the dial to D does say valves open although I cannot hear them. Race of course is the full on experience, but i would and think the valves open sound should be available in D mode"
Deman77,"Please, can you do this test at idle.audio turned off, windows down, from N to D can you hear the difference? turn up to Race can you hear the difference?Pay attention it’s exhaust and not just a bit of extra rev at idle. You can really tell when valves open at idle."
aspender,"Yes, like the man in the orthopedic shoes: I stand corrected.I was likely mistaking higher revs/later shift in D vs N and yes there is a pronounced difference at idle with Race vs D.Having taken delivery in early October I've only used Race once or twice in a straight line for a minute here or there so am not overly familiar with how it sounds in real anger yet. I'm still being highly amused with the sounds and performance that D generates"
Deman77,Lol. I’ve been in D after I drove it back but after I got paranoid about exhaust I tried Race and then just couldn’t bear to stop using it.It’s a bit silly on full throttle - over before it starts - 30-60 in like nothing and so much drama. So I basically drive it in Race but I don’t floor it but try to modulate the throttle even if I take it to high revs. That lets me enjoy the cornering and the feedback and it’s also a lot smoother experience. I prefer the pop on lower rev shift in race too. Still wish I could hear more of the exhaust from inside. Might start driving with rear windows open.
Nathan P,Welshrugby said:Ordered early august but delivery december :-(Nice review:Click to expand...Love this review! 😍The Stelvio is an added bonus.
Welshrugby,"Done around 800 miles now and getting just under 20mpg with mixed driving. Starting to drive it a bit more now in race mode which can get a bit twitchy through town centres as it over revs a bit in automatic mode so the answer is to use the paddles and then it drives more smoothly around town centres but still with the nice growl but without embarrassing over revving. The sound in all modes when booting it is great but in race, its bloody great"
Welshrugby,"yes good review, holy **** she says lol. The car wow review I like also and there are a fair few more.

Deman77,"getting my first fuel scare.it was showing a 35% on Sunday. A bit of light use yesterday - a 20mile round trip, a few short school runs and missus says it went mental at her on school run this morning. I updated the app and it went from 35% to 10%. Luckily my nearest Shell is a mile away. But still a bit uneasy.heard the cold start from outside the car today. I didn’t realise it’s so loud. It went quieter as wife started pulling out but I am definitely not modifying my exhaust now I heard it."
aspender,"I've yet to let my quad go less than half-full but just out of circumstance.My previous 280PS Stelvio (like all of them) had a rather asymmetric fuel guage. The further down it gets the faster it declines, if that makes sense. I used to start getting range anxiety with three bars showing. Pretty soon after hitting two bars the range indicator wouldn't show any remaining mileage."
leraunch,"Mine was similar with the fuel gauge getting to 3 bars and then running out fast, then i got a recall letter from Alfa to take it in to have a software update as a common fault and all been good since."
Welshrugby,"My Giulia Veloce was the same and the new Stelvio. The fuel tank is not that big and as you guys say, get down to 3 bars which looks like quite a lot and suddenly the reserve light comes on. I know I had a recall about the fuel gauge and software on the Veloce several months ago but it seemed to exaggerate the problem. Its ok driving it on low but when it shows 35 miles then suddenly zero, gets a bit hairy."
Deman77,It only fit 54l after two bars turned the warning on. So that must have been 10l warning.
Welshrugby,"So 10 litres is a little over 2 gallons so at 18mpg, you have around 36 miles to go before chugging to a stop. In previous BM's of mine, I occasionally got down to 0 miles range and still managed to find a garage. I wish the Alfa gauge would also go down to 0 but we get use to it I suppose. I will start using the APP once I get the damn alfa connect log in details and the box serviced. I think the guy must be on furlough, I may have to wait"
Welshrugby,"Slight annoying issue. Listening to the radio, you pull up at the supermarket, home or wherever, you don't want to leave the engine on so you press the red start/stop button. The radio immediately finishes right when you may want to spend time listening to the finish. I am sure my previous alfa only cut the power to the radio/medium once the door was opened"

Left side is completely covered.Do you guys see the same ?LeftrightRight a bit deeper in"
Welshrugby,Just checked and have exactly the same as you. You would think those connections have to be vulnerable unless they are resin potted. They could have added a small length of adhesive lined heatshrink to cover but this must be something known to them
Welshrugby,"Now had the stelvio quad for 2 months and about 2300 miles. Love it and look forward to driving it each morning and night, have it for 4 years and boredom will not be an issue I know.Some slight annoyances in no particular order:-1. I am ok with the rear camera clarity but find you constantly have to remember to give it a quick wipe most times before driving it otherwise you can't see much due to condensation, rain or dirt. My merc had a pop out one, so always stayed clean.2. Small fuel tank, same as the Giulias I think think so more trips to the fuel pumps. Chance for another pose I suppose.3. Tyres scrub when turning in car parks, my last alfa did this also.4. Still not figured out how to change easily from radio to media (spotify) via the buttons so verbally ask it to go to audio, which is probably the quickest option anyway to be fair.5. Because I didn't opt for Alfa red, haven't had any admiring comments since purchase like I did with the Giulia. Suppose I should prefer the lack of admiration and enjoy my extra free time not explaining about the car to strangers in car parks.6. The seatbelt buckle keeps falling to the bottom below the seat level and I have to keep scrabbling around for it."
Welshrugby,"Launch ControlI didn't think it had one but then saw a video of someone holding the break, foot on excelerator and release. Tried it in race mode with the drag race performance timers. Slipped it over to manual, foot on brake, rev flat down but it held at 2500 rpm so no crazy wild noise, let go and wham, kicks you back in your seat and achieved 4 seconds at about 2 degC on wet country road up a hill.Will improve on that soon, given some nice flat dry roads but heard today that Alfa may limit the amount of times you can operate this system as i wears out the clutch plates or gearbox and they then may withdraw the warranty?Anyone know about this limit, anyone else tried the launch?"
Deman77,not tried. I don’t imagine it will do that much damage as you’d get bored after 4-5 times plus you are not doing it time after time through the night and most hardware is there to cope with occasional hot lap. You will be fine with middle aged public road fun - just respect the limits. Just make sure you warm up not just oil but transmission too - it shows in performance pages and that usually take a bit longer than oil.I take it you are doing this on pz4 given that you are scrubbing. 4sec is very impressive in the cold.Turn it to torque distribution on performance pages. It is quite telling. I don’t usually floor it from standstill (missus does but I get embarrassed with all the people around you - may be I’ll get used to it) for me it’s more feel the diff on roundabout exit or a nice pick up exiting 30 onto twisty 60. you can’t look at screen in 2nd as that blurs my vision and it is all over in like a second but usually I do it in 3rd as it is still faster than anything but lasts a bit longer. So even flooring from 30 in 3rd on straight I can see it moving torque to the front which in race will only happen after it let rears spin a little. That is shocking power to spin 285 cross section in 3rd. I now understand why Giulia needs so much respect. Ours are like a racing sim in comparison - just point and squirt.
Welshrugby,"Did a 3.8 0-62 last week and not even in raceNew review, the bloke is a bit annoying but the review is not too bad"
Deman77,"was summery warm yesterday, so Pz4 were probably able to grip better but still in the wet, very impressive. Was it downwind perhaps- quite blustery.One of the fastest no-nonsense 0-60 cars full stop. Many would need lots of setting tweaking or launch control messing about to get their top numbers and this just goes. Plus if you consider it does it in the wet you will have to rule out a few rwd super cars too and when you also take into account that it does it over real world surfaces in every day driving mode and you have to do it in comfort suspension setting on most sports or super cars I do not think there will be many stock cars left that will beat you.Are you managing to hit it in second or in third? I think sixty is around the limiter for second so might be able to do with only one gear change. Then your quest for best time will be in both getting off the line and the first gear change."
Deman77,Just noticed last week it was. That was cold. May be they accidentally stuck their GTA gear into your stelvio?
aspender,Only today have I got my first 0-60 figure show up on the performance pages. Only 5.8s...... but it was from a side road doing a right turn onto an A road

Welshrugby,
Welshrugby,"How are you all?Had the Stelvio now since November 2nd 2020 and clocked up 10K miles so I am there or thereabouts hitting my 15K contract hire figure. But who gives a s@!! if i go over, so much fun to drive. Serviced at just under 9K and all four tyres at 3mm tread. Not surprised at the rears but maybe the front wheels turn more than I thought they would. No problem, tyre replacement is in my service package unless there is some nasty small print.I have had no quality issues, no recalls from the garage. On long journeys I can eek out 29-31mpg driving in advanced efficiency mode and generally avoiding rapid acceleration, but still driving most of the motorway journey at close to 80mph. In normal day to day, I get between 20-22mpg driving mostly in natural mode with a mixture of race mode on the country roads home.It is comfortable on long journeys and around cities but an animal when you want it to be.I still wonder if i should have chosen another colour, previous guilia veloce was alfa red, loads of admirers, this one is vesuvious grey, very few admirers except those that love alfas and those that read car reviews. On balance, I am happy with the understated look and know that I can burn most cars off that look faster.If you guys want to bling up your quads"
Welshrugby,"By the way, the dealer confirmed, don't try the unofficial launch control of revs and foot on break and release. It will bugger it up. Have tried a few times and works well but don't want a huge engine/gearbox bill for the sake of a couple of tenths of a second. Sub 4 seconds for a chelsea tractor is pretty impressive"

In normal day to day, I get between 20-22mpg driving mostly in natural mode with a mixture of race mode on the country roads home.I can't get much more than 25mpg from a 2.0 Veloce in N mode, how do you get 31 from a Quad?"
Deman77,Top speed is probably what is killing your mpg. I bet you will get 5-7mpg extra if you drop within the speed limit. You will also halve the bug splatter on your windscreen. The bricky shape suvs get a lot of mpg penalty with speed. I remember my 2l diesel xc90 dropped into mid 20s when I kept it at 120 for about an hour on an autobahn and it was just under 40 at french speeds.Speed or not Qv consumption can vary dramatically by style.Empty B roads in race I see mid teens. On track journos claim single digits.I went school mum on mine once just to try (no crazy hypermiling techniques just light throttle driving like a limo in middle lane) half way round m25 with some local traffic other side I had 34.5. Drove my normal quiet family style on the way back and averaged 31 on the round trip. So it must have been 27odd for the same bit of road coming back just not making an effort with the throttle.Another trip 60-70mph with cruise control on the motorway in the middle lane I got about 30-31. Those are the few times I reset the trip meter just to see and to give me confidence I can get to the nearest shell when the remaining range goes -I guess light throttle styles in all modes other than race would be shutting down 3 cylinders and keeping turbos down which is when you can get serious jump in economy. One could probably get well into 40s going at steady 50 or drafting behind a lorry.
Isotope,"I do not exceed the speed limit m'lud, just very surprised at how much more a petrol car consumes fuel than a diesel. Hopefully I've got back on track with the UK government advice, buy a diesel, get rid of the diesel it's poisoning everyone and my new petrol car is good for the universe!"
cue2,The drag coefficient of the Stelvio is reported to be 0.32 which is pretty good but the frontal area is greater than the Giulia. A brick has a drag coefficient of 1.16.
Deman77,To me any of those journeys with high mpg feel like wasted opportunities to enjoy the car. So the lower your mpg the more fun you are probably having.
Isotope,There does come a point where mpg becomes excessive! I cant get much above 25mpg no matter what I do?
Deman77,That is excessive. Especially if you are trying.I have 24.4 in a qv since last reset over 400mi and I am regularly exercising full rev range.Assuming you don’t have many short trips and tyre pressure is correct there has to be something wrong. Check the pads wear in case there is a sticky one somewhere (has been known to happen). Is she tracking ok when hands are off steering wheel? Is tyre wear roughly even across axles and across the thread?
cue2,Some of the fuel consumption change is down to overcoming inertia more often and it can vary according to roads and conditions?
Isotope,"I'm proper short shifting like 8th gear at 45-50mph, so am a bit worried now. Maybe I have a hole in the fuel tank and I'm only at 1200 miles on the clock?"
Deman77,"N will get you into 8th as early as it can.Post #8 here says you are probably not run in yet.MY2020 280 bhp fuellingHi, Wondering what peoples insights or thoughts are on petrol specification for the MY2020 280 bhp engine. This is a highly strung, high compression ratio engine so it would seem that it would benefit (power and MPG) from a high octane 99 RON fuel. However, the following leads me to question...www.alfaowner.com"
Isotope,That could be a good point but I then think too much fuel would cause piston wash in the early life of the engine? Not a good thing to program into the early life of an engine surely?
Isotope,"So did a 150 mile trip today, went Alpaca trekking and still only got about 25mpg!"
Deman77,I thought that was settled - seems that you won’t get good consumption until after 3k or was it 3k metric. Just make sure to exercise the engine regularly so that it runs in properly.

Loving the car still and 3 years to go, life is good with a car such as this. Because of the grey colour, still not much appreciation than if I went Alfa Red, but know what I have and that's ok with me. Fkng awesome"
Welshrugby,Another good review but keep getting some facts wrong like 503 gee gees and carbon fibre bonnet
Per1,"Deman77 said:My first problem.Do you guys find the car too quiet inside. I was pleased with low road noise and just a hint of wind noise on the motorway journey after I picked it up but now driving around in D valves open (says so on mode info screen) I can barely hear anything - just a distant hum. Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice change from my tractor of a diesel Volvo which also sounded like it was running inside the car but here it’s nothing and the noise was one of the main reasons I bought this thing. I remember it sounded to die for from outside with open valves and I think the one I test drove did not lack for noise inside though I suppose it was less hushed on the motorway for noise. I didn’t complain just going 50-70 and back down in race mode like an idiot for 20miles. But don’t seem to get any of that in my MY20. But I was hoping to hear open valves all the time. Did they neuter them with their refinement efforts? Could it be in run in mode for exhaust? It definitely farts on high rev gear change but everything sounds very distant and hushed. I didn’t buy it to bother other people - I want to listen to it but I cannot hear much. Do you open windows to hear? Should stereo be on to get the engine noise supplementary noise? I will listen outside tomorrow perhaps my flaps are not open.Click to expand...Just reading through this post and I agree - inside the care is quiet - the Quadrifoglio I test drove had more sound inside, and I think that may be down to the 19 onwards models seem to have insulated glass in the doors - look at the top of the glass - it appears to be two thinner sheets with a laminated sheet between where as most other cars have slightly thicker door glass but most clearly just a single sheet. I suspect this is part of their aim for luxury and comfort in the cabin."
Per1,"I had the valve control fitted a few weeks ago. Sounds a whole lot better now of course and nice to know the sound track is there without needing to disconnect all safety systems!The menu option to open valves in all modes that was meant to be there on 20 and 21 models appears to have been excluded in the EU for some reason, but is available in the USA."
Welshrugby,"omg, just had this fitted and what a difference in soundhttps://www.ahmotorsports.co.uk/road-car-parts/alfa-giulia-stelvio-quadrifoglio-exhaust-flap-control"
Deman77,I don’t understand. Wouldn’t it be just Race sound in any mode?Or you like the race noise without the car being on edge with all the other settings? I imagine it could sound a bit unpleasant in 3cyl mode which engages off throttle low revs in lower modes once engine warms up. That sounds a bit cheap and unbalanced with flaps closed. Wonder what it is like with them open.
pocholin,"Wow, you can tell the sound of the quieter exhaust on a moving vehicles when it switches to 3 cylinder?!?!?! I've tried but can't hear it...sometimes I can feel the car's small change in vibration rhythm but that's about it."
Welshrugby,"Once you have pressed the button to open the valves, they stay open next time you start up. Yes it sounds like race mode in N and D mode, I haven't actually tried the other modes yet but will tomorrow and report back. It is louder than race mode on tickover, especially morning start up which can be very loud and had me closing the flaps to avoid the neighbours curtains twitching. It sounds like this is the way the car should sound for such a beast. Because you are not in race mode, the suspension is softer of course and it's less snatchy and you have the benefit of the safety systems. You can get it snarling, popping and farting straight away if you gun it or a good burble if you take it steady.I paid £320 with VAT and then had it fitted by a garage for £45 as it was a 30 min job. I now for the first time have had people look over at the car as I enter car parks, they I guess now realise it is a performance car and not a fiesta or corsa with a huge open system.I should have done it in November 2020 but I still have it until November 2024 so lots of time to enjoy"
Deman77,This is it. It feels like the car is labouring in too high a gear.You can’t hear the exhaust in the car but you can hear the absence of the exhaust note - In 6cyl exhaust sounds very good even with the valves closed. With 3cyl on it’s like the exhaust is completely turned off. I was wondering if that no sound might change with open valves and what that would sound like.
Welshrugby,"This morning i drove the car in N mode and valves open. Warmed it up before I switched in to A mode, the sound from the exhaust hardly changed, if at all. Tried in all modes and sound was pretty much the same whether at standstill or when driving.If you stand at the back of the car whilst it ticks over, switch the valves off and it is almost silent. Do you want silence from your 510hp beast or should it be allowed to breath"
Deman77,"Mine has different (deeper) sound when idling in all modes.The exhaust is always quietest when coasting even in race even though it’s open valves and cylinders do not deactivate - I would slow down towards traffic lights almost no sound, then gear disengages and it turns on this deep rumble.perhaps it burns richer mixture at idle"
Welshrugby,"I had a recall on my stelvio quad radio. Not sure what was involved but the sat nave was definitely updated and now shows the tomtom symbol.Since then and it may have nothing to do with it1. In drag race 0-60 mph i got a 3.2 seconds and the following week a 2.6 seconds2. My tyre pressure monitoring systems keeps warning me of different pressures and not sure if this is linked to the drag race inaccuracy due to this recall updateAnyone else noticed issuesLoving the quas still, valves open all the time, very loud"
Isotope,"I'm 56 and have had a 147 JTD, Giulietta JTDM2, Giulia Speciale and currently sat in a Stelvio Veloce! I am thinking to Mas or not to Mas that is the question!! The Grecale looks like a decent upgrade!!"

,
Deman77,"Grecale is not an upgrade for qv, it may or may not be for veloce depending on what you are after. it does not compete with Stelvio for driving thrills - it will lose out even to macan - heavier and not Ferrari tuned handling.grecale will be competing for looks and uniqueness and will outpace for interior plushness. It is by possible it may beat for exhaust note as Maserati pay attention to how it sounds to the driver.it will cost a lot more like forlike.Youmay be able to get a qv for the price step up to 2l grecale. But it depends what is important to you"
cue2,"The Grecale is a hybrid, using the electricity for a boost and potentially more fuel efficient. The interior is much more indulgent and finished than a Stelvio but I’m not clear what direction the handling has taken. I want to try one to see if it’s slightly less alive than the Stelvio."
Welshrugby,"Hello Stelvio Quad owners. How are things?Mine = loving it still. Glad I fitted the valves open all the time module I mentioned earlier. Unless you have one or have had a demo, you won't appreciate what a noise this thing makes in ALL modes and it rips and snorts with any pressure on the far right pedal. Versuvious grey doesn't attract a lot of attention which I sort of like, but the rumble from the pipes is music most pleasant.Managed to get 30mpg on a trip to Heathrow a month or two back but mostly live around 20mpg.Some drag races produced one or two sub 3 second times, one at 2.5 but that cannot be right, the car or me cannot be that good.Come this November, I have another year to go on my 4 year lease. If they can give me another close to the deal I got means i will renew. If not, could be tempted to extend existing deal by another 2 years. I will be at 60K miles at 4 years and so far at 38K all is excellent"

epsonix,"if you amended correctly locks, then it must work - its now line from pin 3 giving openning pulse to ganged driver/fuel flap (originally connected to pin 18 in US cars) and other doors (originally in US car connected to pin 3). I guess you disconnected original pin 3 cable so no openning of other doors?"
jwq,could it simply be a setting in the infotainment ?
epsonix,"@jwq, I converted >50 US GIulia/Stelvios from US to EU, even one today morning. US cars have that separated, but after reprogramming to EU (to gain language and FM every 0.1MHz and EU maps uploadable to ETM), locks logic changes, and BCM only drives open pulse on pin 3 of the E connector. pin 18 is driven ground all the time. we convert looms to reconnect driver door lock and fuel flap from pin 18 to pin 3, and so no longer this separated functionality have chance to work - all locks are ganged to pin 3."
jwq,"ok, not saying you don't know what you're doing (I was the one who initially refered to you in this thread after all)It's just that people sometimes forget about the settings in the infotainment , apparently not all people read the manual"
epsonix,"after cable conversion this setting does not take effect, as BCM ignores it really when car is set to any Europe country.

Zor,"Epsonix!! You are my guy! I have also bought a Stelvio in US and shipped it to Europe (Netherlands). The door lock has the same issues….just like you have written above. When I try to unlock the doors with the keyfob or even the button on the driver side door, you can hear a click in the driver door, but it will not unlock the driver side door. The other doors do not have this problem. indeed the fuel flap also behaves weird. I can not get that open as well. just like you mentioned above. Can you please give more information in detail how to fix this issue? Since I changed the configuration to Dutch and Netherlands for the country, the navigation does not work.

epsonix,"since you mentioned dealers, then some chance maps for this market also exist. how accurate and updated they will be is other story (australia case where updates go slowly). anyway, you would need to find other giulia/stelvio users who has copy of some maps to try for your size either these 8GB small nav or 11GB bigger nav depends which type of radio you have (display out of factory), see if it will go in. In Europe maps up to 6.2020 went in no matter of VIN mismatch, newer requires VIN match.

dj_splash4004,I would pay for a detailed guide on how to do the wire modifications. I also have a US spec Giulia I want to convert to EU.
epsonix,"all was written there for free - you cut pin 18 wire of left vertical BCM connector (it is marked M001 ""E"" on some pictures if you have schematics, but don't worry, it is left plug with 2x16 pins, pin markings are on housing, thick wires white-orange and green orange in giuli, red-green and red-white in stelvio if I remember correclty on top of my head), and then locks side you gang with pin 3 wire. You reprogram country in proxi to yours, change indicator/stop setting in proxi to separated as in Europe (of course change rear lamps to Europe or modify them with high power yellow LEDs at least). That is base of conversion. then many cases depends on headlamps you have, headlamps you are putting in, if you go for leveling (either manual for 25W EU or automatic for 35W AFLS, and here if your car had looms for such or no free looms so all needs to be added). Then headlamp washers, again may be added with adding lacking looms/system/tank with pumps/adding lacks in fuseboxe on right of bonnet beside windscreen and programming it in. Aside of this navigation maps to write in. On postlifts there may be some issues with TBM which may need to be disconnected before proxi (I do not know other solution, but with postifts US I never dig in - I stopped doing conversions/in car jobs 2+ years ago in the time postlits from USA did not yet started reaching Europe). On some postlifts can't write in easily maps as far as I heard - no solution other than sending it to one guy I know who knows how in his lab put maps in. for prefacelfits there are mid 2020 maps around, sure somebody coudl share you if these are ones you need.Note, I no longer do any jobs with car conversions - stopped bit more than 2 years ago, no time at all. Lost also my laptop with 2020 maps, so can't help here on sharing unfortunatelly."
dj_splash4004,Thanks!@epsonixI'm thinking of doing it myself as I'm not afraid of tinkering .To sum up :1. Left vertical BCM connector is1Cconnector from second picture in this doc :Link2.Pin 18 ( white-orange )wire is cut and joined withPin 3 (green orange )wire.3. Change country and do proxy align.Also I've been reading that people have issues whit Seat and Mirror Memory after Country change.Any idea about that?
epsonix,"1.yes,2.yes3.yes + change indicators/stop setting to EU. depends on lamps you had, lamps you put in and if you add e.g. leveling sensors you may have to or can't change sidemarkers to EU/off4.seat often requires recalibration run - it is procedure in e.g. MES in CSWM. in NAFTA cars on front/back pulling screws of driver seat, there are say 2cm long plastic limiters on front side - you need to remove them and then run calibration. seat will travel a few times front/back so keep space to let it do this. job done.then in menu infotainment in your car you change language, and you are ready to upload EU maps.if car is postlift with TBM, it may be that you need to disconnect it before proxi (forever), as some do not let region change (probably GSM/LTE SIM card prepaid for NAFTA and TBM locked for this market?).On some postlifts people have issues with uploading maps, not sure why. postlifts work on exFAT USB memory sticks for updates/maps, prefecelifts on NTFS format. quick format before copying files to stick required, and safe removal from PC recommended. maps upload when engine is running, must switch off start&stop."

epsonix,"25W USA -> 35W AFLS EU requires:1.for horizontal tracking add looms and AFLS module (located in right side of glove compartement)2.for by EU law required auto levelling :a) you need to add looms for suspension sensors (only some and usually Stelvios not giulias had free looms)b)you need to add sensors/levers for them including mounting holes in wishbones (drilling and making thread)c)need to probably at least proxi it (maybe also modify proxi, don't know, only did 35W ->35W to add auto auto leveling)d)for 35W you should also have headlamp washer system to be legal in EU (25W do not require it)In terms of rear lights, did you at least changed proxi to separate indicator from stop light (EU mandatory)Also did you at least changed LEDs to Yellow or still running on red? (Yellow at least closer to legal, though most are not well visible through red glass of US tailamps in indicator rection)Changing country has nothing to do with remote start - e.g. I have it added in my EU car as tens of other people"
dj_splash4004,That seems like a lot of work for AFLS. I guess I'm gonna leave them as is or make a project out of it when I get bored.Rear lights are US style . The car is registered and is legal in Romania to run Red indicators. I'll see about changing to separate indicators at least.Thank you for the information. You've been truly helpful!
epsonix,"yes, only to add only autolevelling to afls already there is a few hours job due to poor access (would be much easier if dashboard was out). to add afls and other looms another time. find afla also etc - might turn to several hours to find all connectors,order stuff etc. typical job for somebody as hobby and with too much spare time - not for workshops which would need to charge a lot and woudl not be able to predict jobtime/cost at start.Red lights are nowhere legal in EU as far as I know. Yes you have roadtests possible done without too much care for details (e.g. in Poland it is also bit of problem), but you never know when your car will be stopped by police, you may get ticket and loose right to drive until sorted out etc. also accident - may be reason for somebody who even hit you on his fault to claim your wrong lights as confusing factor/illegal and you may become not the victim but pay for other car damages. Also go abroad with the car - don't get surprised when stricter Austrian or German police will get your car towed out in the middle of holiday trip - nothing nice. get at least your rear lights converted (in poland they charge around 130EUR for such conversion), or buy 2nd hand full set of EU lamps (they are not so red glass, more pinky, so you need set of all 4! - cost probably EUR300-350 2nd hand (I sold mine perfect condition for EUR220 2.5 years ago when I bought brand new GTA taillamps and wanted get out old quickly as they took space in my garage))"

cue2,I got mine new two years ago and it has the 5-3-5 deal of a 2 year longer Warranty and 3years servicing. I’m not sure if the service deal is the same one you can buy later on a used car. It’s called something like Easycare. Nice not to have the moment you get the credit card out.

Mash1138,"I have MA1 and BC3 active, what do these cover? Impossible to find details..."
cue2,Didn’t the sales person tell you at handover?
Deman77,I have the same thing and my 5 year bought plan is not showing up there either. I do have paperwork for the plan at least but nothing but dealer emails to confirm I have 5y rather than 3y warranty. Dealer said they are a bit rubbish with communication but the extra 2y will come in as extended warranty once the original expired and car been serviced properly. But again all I have is dealer words for it.
GVblue,"When we bought our Stelvio last August, I purchased a five year service plan (from Beechdale) for £490 and they gave me a folder with all the details contained therein.The car also came with the five year warranty/recovery plan but I had nothing in writing to confirm that, just an email from the dealer. So I emailed Alfa Customer Services and, after a bit of confusion, they posted to me a booklet/certificate confirming the plan was authorised for our car.It is very comforting knowing that maintenance/service costs are covered for the next five years with only the argument of who pays for the inevitable scored rear discs to worry about."
Deman77,I thought the 3y plans went for 490. For 5y it’s a steal. I paid 1250 for 5y but for qv it’s very cheap too for 5as 4th service alone costs more than that and oil changes are are 300 a piece.
GVblue,"You're right, I meant 3 years but was getting confused with my Giulia. The main point I was trying to make was that I actually have documentary confirmation supplied by the dealer."

Deman77,Yes have dealer issued paperwork for service but will pester Alfa for 5y warranty like you did. 5/5/5 was a big deal for me with such an expensive engine plus it was a first step to help me get over the wall of “Alfa will break” disinformation campaign.
Deman77,So I raised an issue with Alfa customer service (online form) and uk guys rang back a week later and said will look into it. Then someone from Italy called asked me some more and said would come back and a week later someone from Italy called and said it is all on the system now and any dealer should see it.I checked on the website and it changed now - showing lots more things.it’s not very clear on the website but you can workout that that 45k 5y is for service and the other must be warranty and roadside. I would ignore km thing. It seems that they are using km and miles interchangeably without conversion.Today I also received a personalised booklet showing the 5y warranty. So to avoid a hassle with the dealers do chase up AR cs.
Muz,"That was a great bonus on a new car purchase Deman!I am taking out a 3 year service plan(2nd,3rd,4th year services) for £649 which I thought was a decent deal"
Deman77,"5-0-5 was a big consideration. By the time the car was built my20 could be had quite a bit cheaper especially from stock but adjusted for the cost of warranty extension and 0% apr that fca finance gave me it was not much difference.I do think that whoever thinks they have it, chase up AR to make sure it’s on the system so not arguing with dealers."
cue2,Mine was put onto the system last January at the first service by the dealer I bought it from. I didn’t use them again for this year‘s service. The same dealer took my money when I bought the service pack on my previous Alfa and the registration was delayed a week or two by which time it was free. It took a few weeks to get a cheque for the £500 back from them.
mrpbailey,"I just booked in for a 1st service to find it was already included, nobody had told me that!I also enquired about the service care packs, and apparently car has to be 1 year old before it can be activated. Was also told that the 3 year plan has now increased to £649 instead of £499."
Deman77,649 for service 2-4 is better value than 499 for service 1-3 because 4th service is very expensive on the petrols.
Muz,My recently acquired car is 11 months old and on 7500 miles. It had it’s 9000 mile service when I bought it.It appears that you get a decent discounted Mopar Dealer rate if you pre purchase up to 5 non wear and tear services. Have any of you done this? The services can be redeemed at a dealer of your choice it seems.Thoughts welcomedThanks
,
mrpbailey,"That is true, I was told the cost of service 4 was four hundred and something alone."
GVblue,"That's not expensive for a fourth service, I paid £480 for the second year service on my petrol Giulia last June.Before the band strikes up, I now have a service plan."
CABBLACK,"Got an email last week from Beechdale offering 3 year service plan on my Veloce for £449 plus a free boot liner worth £84 if I took the offer which was valid until 31 March.I contacted Beechdale to ask if this was the Mopar Easy Care Service plan and could it be used at any uk dealer as although I bought the Veloce from them in Oct 20 I am based in South London, They said that the email although headed up as from Beechdale would have been sent direct from Alfa UK and they would check it out and get back to me, After a couple of days they replied confirming it was the Mopar plan and could be used at any uk dealer so have now bought the plan and boot liner is on order very pleased £449 for 3 services is a great deal"

CABBLACK,"Yes covers services 1,2 & 3, I was quoted £699 for this by another dealer"
cue2,The 4th service is more expensive than the first 3?
Muz,"Yes, includes spark plugs, air filter, trans belt, brake fluid change as well as oil and filterI had the first service included in the price of the purchase, done at 9 months and 6500 miles, hence buying services 2, 3 and 4. Appears to be a bargain (to me) at £649"
GVblue,The dealer will be cutting a few corners on that one then.
Muz,"Whose to say they won’t be cutting corners on a full price service if they were that bent?As this is an Alfa plan valid at any main dealer I assume the dealer bills Alfa for the parts and labour? Could be a loss leader from Alfa themselves?Who knows, but I’m not letting the cynic in me bin an £800 discount on the three servicesThree services now showing on my Mopar account and I have the receipt, so all looking good"
Simon156,"Just to revive this thread because the service plans are still available but if you look on most dealer sites (or MOPAR) they are difficult or impossible to find.

VeloceRosso,"Had anyone ever managed to get a warranty claim on brake discs?Got my first MOT done today (passed!) and the tester put an advisory for the discs being pitted and corroded.He said that’s pretty poor on a car that’s only done 13,000 miles and said I should mention it to the dealer when it’s serviced next week.Just wondering what the chances are or am I looking at a big bill?"
,
MadMotoUK,No experience with a warranty claim but I'd say it's unlikely. Discs and pads are classed as consumable items.
VeloceRosso,"That’s the ‘get out clause’ I suspected they’d use!Just seems like pretty poor quality- my old works Passat had done 67,000 miles before it needed new front discs about 90k before it needed rears."
MadMotoUK,"Shite isn't it?On the same subject, I'm actually impressed with Ford for once. Changed the original front pads on the Transhit a few weeks back, 38.5k and the discs are still good. Changed the rears last week at 44k, discs have a tiny lip but they'll be ok till the next change. Considering it's a 3.5t van and is always pretty much on it's weight limit, I don't think that's bad at all. Fitted Bosch pads as they give much better bite than the OEM ones. Probably won't last as long though but braking performance is notably better now."
VeloceRosso,That’s impressive! 44k on a van and mine are nasty after 13k.Good Old Ford (I miss my Capri!).
MadMotoUK,"Oh, for the record, I hate Ford with a passionI only have a Transhit because there were no Masters available and Alfa don't do vans."
VeloceRosso,"My mate had a fairly new Transit works van and the engine failed big time.Ford fitted a brand new replacement under warranty.A year later, the exact same thing happened and it needed another engine.His company have just bought him a new van - another Transit! Bizarre."
MadMotoUK,"I service mine every 15k, service book says 36k. But I am doing 60k a year."
matty74,"I think you’ll struggle, guess it depends on your dealer. I had 2 rear sets replaced through Beechdale under warranty on my Giulia, a few years back and had a problem with my rears on my Stelvio at 2nd service a while back at TJ VickersI ended up changing the rear pads myself as we were due to go away the day after service, 1 pad was down to about 2mm all others about 7mm as caliper sliders obviously get stuck. Fitted a set of Borg & Beck pads on and my rear discs are now looking like you’d expect discs to look like after 13kSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
VeloceRosso,Cheers guys.I’ll see how I get on next week but I’m expecting it’ll be costly!
matty74,Don’t let them con you if they won’t do it under warranty. Any reputable garage would have the pads done in no time. Took me 25mins per sideSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
paultrim,"I’ve done 35k in my Giulia QV, still original pads and discs. Don’t understand the vast spread in wear?"
Nickhoughton567,Not stelvio but I had pagid disks and pads and they came with 2 year warranty. They warped after a few weeks… swapped out no fuss.
MultiDoc,I replaced discs and pads front and back on mine (Stelvio QV) at 48000m and the rears to be honest were good for another at least 4-5k but thought better to do all of them.
VeloceRosso,Thanks all for the input.Interesting that some seem to have lasted a good while and mine haven’t.48k on a Stelvio QV is impressive! I’d have thought if anything was going to wear it’s brakes out quickly it would be a QV!Would seem to indicate faulty discs on mine but I expect they’ll pull out the wear and tear card.
matty74,Stelvio / Giulia QV have a separate parking brake caliper on the rear.I think the wear problem on the standard set up is related to one caliper for both applications.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
braddersR,"I had my rear disc's and pads replaced on my Giulia veloce after about 16K miles as discs were coroded. Dealer wanted around £500, so I bought the parts myself and a local garage fitted them. Job came in at around £300"
wictod,"my original set pads and discs lasted 35k miles, the replacements are doing ok 10k later but the MOT guy is moaning about signs of corrosion on them although they're functioning properly. I think some MOT places are really tight on things like that.."
symon,"Do those of you who are getting poor life from the brake discs use the adaptive cruise control often?It will likely brake the rear wheels to keep you at the set speed or set distance if it needs to, and you may not even feel it happening."
wictod,I haven't got the adaptive cruise control but spend a lot of time in standard cruise control emulating the adaptive with the toggle switch.. I have to go along a 20 mile stretch of average 50mph quite often and tend to use the cruise control in that mode.

,
sprint_veloce,Can't imagine why adaptive cruise would brake the rear wheels only. Certainly uses the brakes fully when traffic in front stops!
symon,"Braking just the rear wheels won't cause the front of the car to dive as much as braking the fronts, so for gentle braking it is preferred.If if decided you needed to slow quicker or if you were going more slowly it would brake all four."
sprint_veloce,"Under gentle braking there is no noticeable dive, so not sure that makes sense."
VeloceRosso,"Yes I use cruise a lot and the MOT tester did mention that it can have an effect on rear brakes due to the way it works.However, the VW i referred to in the earlier post was always driven on cruise control as it spent a lot of time on motorways and they still lasted until 67k."
Isotope,"I got mine yesterday for my Stelvio and it is so seamless I didn't even know Waze was up and running on the centre screen until I had the ""Railroad"" warning! The only thing that seemed strange was that phone calls are done using SIRI? I can't remember if that is still the case with the wired Carplay, I thought I still used the telephone button on the steering wheel? Can anyone confirm that's right? Also it says firmware updates are OTA but I can't find any so assume it came with the latest version? Any advice would be appreciated but 2 days in and I'm impressed!!"
,
Mash1138,"Does this kit support Android auto in full screen in Stelvio 2019,"
Isotope,Unfortunately I don't know but from what I have read it can make an Android phone emulate an Iphone if your car only has Carplay. Someone on here will know for sure!
bobbybox,to update the carlinkit you need to (once connected to carplay) open up a browser on your phone and enter 192.168.50.2 in the address bar.This will open the Settings screen for the device. from here you can make a number of setting changes and update the running firmware of the device. You can also roll back to older versions if needed.I have the v3.0 of the same device and it works brilliantly on my 2019 Stelvio. I have even used the settings above to add the correct manufacturers icon to carplay so it looks completely stock (see image below).Good luckBB
wictod,"This is a weird one and have searched all over the boards for some other cases of this..Anyway, randomly but getting progressively more frequent I get this strange sound when accelerating, it's only on the acceleration sometimes at the start of the pedal being used but sometimes part way through a long burst, say going up a hill..The sound is very odd like the sort of sound you'd get pinging a steel ruler on the edge of a wooden table and shortening the ruler to change pitch, almost cartoon sound effect like... as soon as you lift it stops. You can't recreate it at will so I can't capture it either. Sounds is very prominent over the engine almost like it's in the dash somewhere but I'm sure it's engine side.Any Ideas? 2018 280 Specialie standard setup"
,
Deman77,Does it replicate when you rev in neutral or just with gear on? Have you tested to see if it’s only in certain gear(s) or all? Is it limited to parts of rev range or all across?
wictod,"I've never managed to get it to do it in neutral although I haven't spent a lot of time testing it because it's not every time you rev it happens.. I'll have to use the paddles to quote gears as I normally drive full auto but more often than not it's when you accelerate hard and very infrequent when your just going on the gas.. so a 85/15 split in favour of hard.. Coming to think about it, it's not happening in the first 3 gears but the box is so close it could be 4 or 5 onwards, never pulling out of junction from stationary. Had it the other day and it sound like a ratchet type noise, short burst whilst on the gas like opening a crock lock if you remember them."
wictod,Update: Ok so I've narrowed this sound down to correspond when the engine is developing maximum boost pulling the car from 1500rpm upto about 2750 - 3000rpm in gears 3 thru to 7. I invested in MES and done the data logging and the rpm and max boost intersect at the point the noise starts. I posted over on the USA forum and got some responses and one of the guys who knows turbos sorted of talked me through taking the intake off etc to check if there was any play on the cold side of the shaft.. There wasn't any play so it's still not obvious what causes this noise. I managed to record what happens from the engine bay and you can hear the rattling very easily and obviously sounds different to what I'm hearing in the cabin. I can get this noise to occur in the N and D modes but can't get it to do it in the A mode.. I might do another data capture in the A mode as I suspect it won't generate the same level of boost.. After spending a few weeks reading about turbos from scratch the only thing I can think it might be is the wastegate clattering but I really don't have a clue.. It sounds like an expensive problem though.. any thoughts appreciated. Cheers
TheCrazyCabbage,"It sounds like a vibration within the turbo impeller shaft - the shaft that joins the two rotating parts of the turbo.Possible causes could be slight damage to one of the blades of the turbine or impeller blades, usually the impeller. Another cause could be some wear in the shaft bearings, causing it to run misaligned.Given the speeds the shaft rotates, any slight imbalance or play could cause it.You said you checked the play in the shaft, was there absolutely no play at all, as this would be bad. There should be a tiny amount of movement."
wictod,I took the intake off and managed to reach the fan.. there was maybe 1.5mm - 2mm play along the shaft push/pull and not really any play side to side.. Once you get through the 3000rpm and max boost it doesn't make any noise at all.. Cheers
TheCrazyCabbage,"1.5-2mm of play does seem a little much. What do the impeller blades look like, is there any damage or bent tips?"
wictod,"On the cold side the impeller looks perfect, the play is difficult to measure, it's not the easiest thing to grab hold of but I can feel a slight movement.."
TheCrazyCabbage,"The blades seem to look fine, there's no evidence i can see of bent tips, or damage, nor any oil, which is indicative of a worn shaft bearing. can you grab it with some long-nose pliers?"
wictod,"I'll try and find some time to take all the intake off again, from what I've been told, there should be a small bit of play along the shaft but none up and down.. at some point in the near future i'm taking to my local specialist to have all the exhaust bolts and fixings checked they're tight.. it has also been suggested that under pressure some of the gaskets could leak causing vibration. There's no smoke or reduced mpg either.. driving around without pushing it the engine is very smooth.."
TheCrazyCabbage,"Correct, a little in and out is good, but nothing up/down or side to side. 1.5-2mm in/out is a bit much though.Its also true a badly fit gasket can cause similar noises - especially metal gaskets! I have had a Zafira with a bolt missing from the intake piping, and 2 vehicles, (t5 transporter and a transit connect) with bolts broken on the exhaust manifold causing a noise akin to a dying rodent, especially at full boost"
wictod,"Thanks for your input... whatever the problem is it's also causing some level of vibration as seen in the video, although not felt in the cabin, the camera was crudely mounted on the inner wing with duct tape and you can see the fluttering of the image at the same time the noise occurs.."
stelviowner,"My Stelvio does something a lot like this. A noise on acceleration like a steel ruler being twanged and moved up in pitch. I never investigated this in any depth. I reckon that it is something vibrating in the back of the dash. Only happens when you put your foot down but I always assumed that the acceleration causes vibration which reflects in the plastics in the back of the dash. Of late I now have a second vibration mirroring the first one. I still think its is a vibration inside the car. If the turbo finally explodes, oh well so be it. I don't reckon the turbo is at fault I feel that it is more superficial than that. Part of Alfa ownership is developing the shrug. I certainly ain't spending a shed load of money investigating a maybe, when I am completely content that there is nothing of consequence to see here."
wictod,"I had exactly the same thoughts about the dash until I strapped a phone onto the inside of the wing to record it.. it sounds much worse from the engine bay.. It could still be vibration but it's related to the boost, I can't get it do it in the A mode at all no matter how hard I try but in N & D it can be recreated at will? It seems to be quite rare, not one of the ""don't worry they all do it type of sounds"""
stelviowner,"If yours does it and mine does it perhaps it is not so rare after all. If however it seems that your turbo is about to self destruct please let us know. Mine started to make the noise at quite a modest mileage therefore suggesting it is not a wear and tear fault. Still, I just hope that it keeps on doing it. Perhaps the turbo blades are going supersonic now that they have worn in, the acceleration remains brisk even with the noise happening."
VeloceRosso,"I am about to replace the battery on my Stelvio.Since it let me down a while back, I’ve never had much confidence in it and the local dealer wasn’t interested in replacing it under warranty (they don’t seem very interested in much though!).As I’ve got some long Europe trips planned soon I am going to bite the bullet and buy a Varta AGM one but am wondering what the wisdom is regarding whether to go for the standard size (80Ah) or the larger capacity one (95Ah I think but still fits in the tray).There’s not too much difference in cost but is it worth doing or not? Thanks."
,
Navlet,I went for 95Ah AGM when I replaced mine.Fits under the spare wheel no problem figured the bigger the better when it comes to battery capacity.
VeloceRosso,That’s very much what I was thinking.It’s only about £18 more for the larger one so seems worthwhile. Cheers.
maxiboy wales,how long do you intend to keep the carfound an agm with a lifetime warranty 096 type but do others. lifetime warranty same car same owner for 190
VeloceRosso,Thanks but I got one fitted last week.Varta AGM - 95Ah version for £135 - ( staff discount)I’ll keep the car for as long as I can get a warranty on it - factory one runs out in July so hoping to extend it. This is my main car now the company car’s gone so it’ll start doing some proper mileage in it now (just clicked over 10k).
AshleyJU,"Quick question, I fitted the Varta 95ah AGM yesterday. Do these batteries have a vent, it appears to have the vent holes on each side however when had a look they either seem blanked off inside or have a one-way filter maybe?If the battery is vented then I didn't get a plug for to block the side not connected to the vent tube."
wictod,"I'd email Varta tech support.. had a quick look around and the general consensus is the AGM batteries need to vent as they'll produce more gas in certain scenarios than the glass mat can absorb. There some datasheets about the battery but it doesn't mention the venting function.From their website glossary:Venting Valve, RecloseableSafety valve in the cell which opens in case of overpressure and closes again automatically when normal pressure has been restored (e.g. gel battery, AGM battery).Cheers"
wictod,"Just went to fill her up and couldn't get the fuel flap open at the garage. After a few start stops / lock unlock of the engine to try and make it release I gave up and had to return home. Anyway was trying to figure out what to do then tried the red string in the boot.. no movement at all and eventually after a hard tug the nylon piece at the actuator end of the red string broke..Back home I managed to slide the painted flap off revealing the black hinge section still locked before my impulsive streak kicked and I hack sawed the section where it locks off Idecided to calm down and read up on the US forum as there's a couple of threads on there before mutilating the hinge to get to the cap..Procedure to sort it out is as follows:1. Get the painted flap off the black hinged section.. (it might be possible to do step 2 without taking the flap off but mines fairly loose anyway) be careful when trying to slide the painted flap off as I nicked the painted flap and will need a touch up on it.. use a plastic piece to wedge it out.2. The fuel flap hinge and whole assembly is popped into the bodywork at the four locations on the photo.. carefully prise out the top section of the assembly towards you.. there's a flimsy seal that surrounds the assembly and you get a suitable spludger in there.. Once the two top latched have come away you can pull the remaining two bottom ones out by hand.3. Carefully pull the assembly out towards the back of the car and rotate slightly to clear the actuator locking swivel T thing or whatever it's called.4. Disconnect the actuator from the cable plug and unscrew the actuator... you can now access the fuel cap.You can put all the bits back without the actuator and it will work like non locking system as there's a bit of spring in the fuel flap door to keep it shut. Don't know how mine has got so rusted up as I still can't move the mechanism to free it up.. It's been a bit flaky since I bought the car so must have been in a bad way around 2018? The actuator is sealed as well, managed to pop the cover of it and it looks like its rusted up?Need to find a replacement ..Cheers"
,
wictod,"Finally got round to replacing this today... 6 months later... anyway, when this failed 6 months ago I rung up the Alfa dealer and explained the part to him ""fuel flap actuator"" and I was quoted £57 + VAT and he wouldn't oblige the part number either.. I ended up getting the same part M670003390 which is for a Maserati Quattroporte from Marenellos for half that price, although they have it marked up for £18.50 before delivery + VAT.. There's also another one, exactly the same (with the exception that it has a square connector and not the oval one for Alfa) for various Audis on amazon for £16..Unfortunately when mine failed I tried the red string emergency release but managed snap the nylon piece at the actuator end so had to reroute this back in again (see diagrams). I'm not surprised it snapped though the string and nylon portion are routed through a 1inch hole in the inner bodywork that doesn't have any grommet on it so when you pull the string the nylon section runs across a 90 degree change in direction across the top of the exposed thin inner body..Access to both the holes (which are not directly connected to each other) are by removing the passenger side plastic cup in the boot.. There's a little cover at the bottom, pop that off then unscrew 10mm nut to remove the plastic cup.. It's a real fiddly job and I need to use a draw cable to complete it.."
manc350,"Good catch, and one to watch, i have noticed mine sometimes won't spring open so will mention at next service.. It needs a right good push then works.Also reminds me.. I tried to open the bonnet on my Stelvio to put screen wash in last week and it would not open so gave up.. methinks I better check that this weekend..."
legacy,"I know it's an old thread but I have just had the same problem. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to release. In the end I managed to get the fuel cover off and then with a chisel I cut through the connector. I have ordered a new one fromEurospares.co.ukPart number: 670003390this is the same one for the Maserrati. I have also read that Audi VW have the same issue. does anyone know if the cheaper ones on Amazon fit the stelvio?I was thinking as the fuel cap shuts ok with the spring would it be better to buy a locking filler cap and do away with the actuator?The joys of owning an Alfa stelvio, but in my opinion they are the best cars on the market. Just love Alfa's on my 5th model now. Must be good as the Italian police use them. 🤣 🤣"
wictod,See the following thread for more info:fuel filler flap stuckSo went to refuel yesterday only to find that I couldn't open the filler flap not the best thing to discover with less than a quarter of a tank managed to slide the cover off to get to the inner bits still no joy ended up having to break the plastic around the actuator to get fuel in to it...www.alfaowner.comThe cheaper ones on amazon that are for Audi are are almost identical except that the connector is rectangular and not oval.. if you prised the top off both and swapped them out it would work.. It seems the general design of both are susceptible to fail. When mine failed I didn't need to cut or chisel anything out although I was at that point panicking because I was low on fuel. I eventually slid the flap off and then removed the whole assembly including the arm from the body then unscrewed the duff actuator.
legacy,"Thanks for your reply. The one from Eurospares is out of stock, this seems to be the problem as lots of suppliers are also out of stock.Think I just buy a locking cap for the time being, seems to be a safer option considering the amount of failures that are being posted in various forums."
wictod,"If you're going to put the flap back I'd carry a small plastic spludger thing to pull the flap open, I ran mine for a long time without a locking cap or actuator.. the flap was nice and flush but difficult for me to get the flap open without a little plastic piece .."
legacy,"Thank for the update, the flap is already back in place. I always have a trim tool in the car."
Anth S.,Hello all.New to the forum after purchasing a 2020 QV back in March.The car came with a carbon fibre rear spoiler already fitted and black Stelvio - Q4 badges so looking at purchasing the front V-Grill cover in carbon fibre or gloss black.I've seen the Koshi V Grill variants but wondered if anyone had come across them from another manufacturer.There are some advertised on e-bay etc but none to fit QV.Any info greatly appreciated.Thanks
,
MultiDoc,"I highly suggest you contact ETuners on FB (for the carbon scudetto), I've sused them a few times myself, good service, honest, geniuine oem parts and good prices."
Anth S.,"HelloThanks for the info, much appreciated.I'll check them out.Cheers"
Holdar,Hello guys!I am based in the UK and require a replacement infotainment screen for my Alfa Romeo stelvio 2020. The chassis/VIN is ZARPAHNN2L7C77493. My previous one was stolen. I’m not too sure about the part number but it may be 156149865. If anyone could suggest where I can get a new screen from then I’d be grateful. I’ve tried ebay etc but the screens are for a left hand drive car i.e. the screen curve is based on where the speed dials are - euro and American.Thank you
,
wictod,Can't help sourcing one but I think the part numbers correct anyway.. number 3 on this diagram for your car..
Holdar,Thank you ever so much! You wouldn’t know where I could locate one from?
wictod,"They seem pretty rare parts at moment, apart from main dealer probably £1400ish I'd try one the ads for breaking car.. I know you've tried Ebay but there's a few Alfa being broken on there, not sure it works as they don't list all the parts.. maybe contact the seller.."
cue2,Those kinds of parts are assigned to each car?Or is it just the screen that needs replacing?
Holdar,It’s just the screen. The current was pulled out!
MultiDoc,"If you're on facebook, search for ETuners, they can source most if not all genuine oem Alfa parts at good prices."
JoeNinety,"My Quad is clicking (rotational) on tight lefts (25k miles), I know from googling around that there is a shim that goes between the hub and the disk, which is supposed to fix it. However, does anyone know the actual underlying root cause?Thanks"
,
MultiDoc,Most probably minimal suspension geometry changes due to ageing that lead to this. I had this fix as per the Alfa service bulletin done on mine and it fixed it.
Deman77,"A couple of months ago missus got shunted sideways on the school run in slow traffic on someone getting mixed up on the roundabout. Hit into front half of the left front wheel and everything above it. Didn’t look like much damage - wheel arch damaged, slight bend to front wing, wheel needs refurb and new tyre. More annoyingly it bent the steering arm.On inspection the ripped out wheel arch damaged a clip hole so bumper had to go (basically no other damage to it could probably be heat repaired but you know can’t guarantee and all that and I don’t want problems come bumper off aux belt service) and steering arm apparently cannot be replaced on its own (!!!) so the whole steering rack needs replacement.Didn’t think much of it. Other side accepted the blame, insurance company are paying for the like for like rental which is boring xc90 but big enough - I thought a month wait. After 5 weeks I got note of bumper coming. But nothing with no ETA on steering rack.So phoned up the repair shop, who ordered through glyn hopkin and gave me their details. Phoned up glyn hopkin they phoned up fca and asked them to up the priority on the order. But two weeks after that still no word and no eta and Europe is about to break for 4-6 weeks.what can I do? It’s been two months. Should I be trying to get hold of fca contact and dig there?"
,
cue2,Sorry to hear this. I did hear on the radio yesterday that car dismantlers are charging almost new prices for parts because of the lack of repair parts.
bazzbazz,"I know it has nothing to do with the topics subject matter, but what makes you think the bumper has to come off to replace the aux belt?"
Deman77,Have a look around - every 4th service is bumper off. Plenty of info even a video for diy on YouTube.
wictod,2.9 v6 Bumper off and about a day of work removing all the other parts... 2.0L No bumper off and about 45 minutes job...

Isotope,If you look into a Stelvio 2.0 engine bay its longditudinal all the belts are on the front and easy to change not like a transverse engine. Transverse usually meant removing an engine mount to change the belts and very tight between the cylinder block and wheel arches.
Isotope,Hi Bazzbazz I was just trying to confirm that the bumper or anything else bodywork wise wouldn't need removing to change the belts on a 2.0 litre Stelvio??
TheCrazyCabbage,"Both the QV and 2.0 have longitudinal mounted engines, but the 2.0 has plenty of access around it, and is relatively easy to work on.The QV is a much tighter fit, and aux belt replacement is compounded by the two water fed inter-coolers, as well and a large brace that sits in front of it, and a myriad of other components."

mdowler8091,"Quick question......So I am installing an inline amp to my door speakers (base system) as well as a powered sub. Of course, I got the ""Stereo System Unavailable"" message. I know that I have to get the resistor inline, and waiting for it to come in, but my question is, when it goes into that mode, does it disable all speakers, or only the ones effected? My issue is I ran all the wires to the luggage compartment, so I hard wired the speakers back up from there, and still getting the issue. There may be another issue, but nothing is working currently.

I don't mind diagnosing, but it isn't giving me any direction on where to start.And on the base system, I know the back door speakers/tweeter are wired together through the door harness, but when I disconnected the front door speakers, the dash tweeters still operated, so one would assume they are separately wired. I am wondering where they split off at since I did my wiring in the door wire boot for the front doors....hmmm."
jwq,which system do you have ? The HK or the base system ?
mdowler8091,Base system. I had added it to my OP because I figured that would be important. lol

mdowler8091,"Thanks for the advice nonetheless. I'm currently stumped. I just ohm'd put all of my connections and they are fine. I have replaced 2 of the 4 door speakers so far, but they 2 I replaced were working. I did a dry run to my amp (still waiting on my load resister) and then hooked them back up to themselves, and still getting the error. The dashboard tweeters are the only things I haven't touched, so guess I may have to look there next. Any diagrams to get to those in the dash?"
jwq,are the speakers you replaced the same resistance (Ohms) as the ones you took out ? Otherwise that's your problem.....
mdowler8091,Yup. Made sure they were 4ohm

I have the base system, so only 2 in the dash and 2 in the back doors."
jwq,"I'll see what I can find, but usually with Alfa there is no crossover as such, but just a capacitor mounted on the tweeter......."

I have a PAC LOC that I ran, but the remote wire on it doesn't turn my amps off for some reason. It has power, but not sure if I am getting some backfeeding going on that doesn't allow it to turn off. I went from replacing some speakers to doing a 100% change out to Cewin Vegas. lol.

Andy1671,I have a slight issue with my air con was wondering if any one has any suggestions (MY2018)The air con has never been icy cold but had it checked at halfrauds and was told its ok pressure wise so can live with thatThe issue I have now is that in the rear of the car the driver side vent only blows warm air where the rest of the vents are blowing coldnow I'm not an expert but I don't think that's how its meant to functionif any one has had anything similar and a fix for it I would be gratefulThanksAndy
,
wictod,Are you talking about the two vents on the back of the arm rest ? Or the under the seats vents.. I think 3 & 4 are the vents under the seats for air in the rear and 6 is the two vents on the rear of the console.. where the problem lies I don't know ? I assume the fans draw air in rather than push it through but it looks like the fans are in the main body of the A/C rather than individual ..
jwq,there is only one fan.... The outlets are controlled by flaps.... (as is the hot/cold mix)
wictod,I'm guessing one of the flaps must be stuck?
jwq,"possibly. Or a problem with a temp sensor.Following doc gives an overview of the workings for giulia, probably almost the same for the stelvio..... :"
Andy1671,It was the vent in to the rear seats in the back of the arm restseems to have sorted itself at the minute so probably a sticky flapnot a massive issue as i never sit in the back seats but i do like stuff to work as it shouldthanks for the reply's
brisc,After 18 (nearly) continuous years servicing of my Alfas by Keith at Monza Sports (highly recommended BTW)- I've emigrated to Inverness and hope for someone who can apply the same standards to my Stelvio near Inverness.Any recommendations please?
,
stelviowner,Following this with interest because we recently bought a holiday home in Embo which is 45 miles north of Inverness. Before coming this far north we bought an Astra because it is much more likely to be familiar to garages in the wilds rather than my Stelvio. The idea is to have a car where you can get the bits from the local paper shop rather than exotic parts that are unobtainable. There is a Fiat dealer in Inverness but no idea how good they are. My Stelvio is staying near the dealership where we mainly live.
brisc,"Thanks for your reply.I had a fabulous 156 GTA previously and found out to my great cost what a risk it is to step away from a trusted Alfa mechanic. In fact Monza did such a good job on that car, they bought it back from me.You don't see too may Stelvios up here (a shame because the roads are fabulous where not potholed).I'm sure there must be a great Alfa mechanic somewhere within a couple of hours drive- Ashington, W Sussex is just too far!"
stelviowner,"There is a Fiat dealer in Inverness called Donald Mackenzie. No idea how good they are, maybe fantastic, maybe awful. If you ask Google for an Alfa dealer in Inverness that is where you end up. They seem to do Fiat and associated brands, the feedback is decent but in reality, no idea. Perhaps you could take one for the team, try Donald Mackenzie out then report back. If you come up with a convincing solution to this issue perhaps let us know. I decided to buy the Astra simply to have a car for Scotland, leave it up here when we go back to our English home and have it serviced and repaired in the local area, hence the decision to buy an often encountered car. Unless the Alfa dealership offer a loan car I am stuffed anyway because I am 45 miles North of you and I can't be asked with the buggeration of public transport which is sparse and/or expensive. If we were to move up here permanently I would probably sell the Stelvio with huge regret but accept that in this area support is scant. Better to own somthing more commonplace."

SickStu,I've used Donald Mackenzie for years and found their service dept. to be pretty good. Light years better than the Mazda dealership my partner has to endure.
stelviowner,Do Donald Mackenzie have a loan car arrangement for customers who don't live around the corner??
SickStu,They've lent me a Fiat Panda a couple of times but a couple of other times there's been nothing available so best to book well in advance.
JTD_Liam,"Donald Mackenzie have been a Fiat dealer (possibly other Italian brands) for decades & have upgraded to the latest Alfa/Jeep dealer design, so I'd say they're at least committed to the brand. I've seen some pics online of them as a Fiat dealer back in the 1970s so I'd be amazed if they weren't any good."
stelvio18,"I've owned this since new and it only has about 10K miles on it. Wifes car and it mostly lives in the garage, for the last couple of years it rarely sees light.My wife took it out yesterday and the dash lit up like a Christmas tree, started running rough, shaking and won't go above about 40, which it takes a long time to get to. Sometimes the shaking is so much you would think you were driving with a flat.I checked battery voltage and it was at 12.25v, which seemed a little low so I changed the battery and cleaned the connectors. This does not seem to have fixed the issue, though some of the warning lights have gone out, it still has heavy vibration/pulsing and shaking.What is the easiest way to read and clear codes? I'm thinking AlfaODB? What do I need to go along with that?Should this come out of limp home mode on its own when the issue is fixed or will it need codes to be cleared first?"
,
AshleyJU,"MES (Multiecuscan - Diagnostics software for Italian cars) is the best option in my opinion for reading and clearing codes.. That being said, if your car is MY18 or newer, you'll likely have a SGW blocking you from clearing the stored codes. If this is the case, you'll either need to purchase and install a SGW Bypass or take it to a dealer with the correct tools. Alternatively, you can hook any OBD scanner to the car to check for DTCs, the majority of readers will provide a decent level of diagnostic.Batteries on these are a bit finicky, I would keep it charged as best you can if the car is used infrequently, a battery tender will help keep this in check.Regarding your issue, I had a similar experience with my Stelvio back in March. After changing my spark plugs and testing the coil packs it turned out to be an issue with the MultiAir unit, fortunately, my car was still under warranty so this was replaced by the dealer. In any case, it would be advantageous to check for errors, hopefully shedding more light on your issue.I've linked my original post below.Misfire, CEL & Errors found: P0303-00, P0300-00...Had my first CEL experience this morning, on cold start I noticed my engine running rough and misfiring. shortly after the dash decided to throw a flashing CEL after a short (slow) drive and a quick engine restart the misfiring stopped and the car drove okay (didn't push it) CEL remained and I...www.alfaowner.com"

cue2,I’m sure some makes of car would be more expensive to fix.
wictod,Alfa Ancaster quoted me £57 just for the actuator a while back and wouldn't give me the part number
cue2,As a customer of theirs I’m sure I could’ve popped in and sorted that out.
Andy1671,I was told the actuator wasn't available as a separate part but at the cost not really a massive hitI did think it would be more but overall not too bad
wictod,Yes that looks to be the case after looking on eper.. maybe that's what they were quoting me for.. the Maserati Part number for just the actuator is670003390
wictod,Are they still an Alfa dealer? .. just browsing around their website and there's only 2 used Alfas on it..
Imoan2,"No they're notAnother thread on here, (I think the battrey one) says they are not"
cue2,They’ve got no mention of Alfa when I just looked.Just Fiat and Abarth aftersales.
GVblue,Does the emergency pull cord in the boot not work then?
wictod,"In my case and probably the rest of failed ones I've seen (rusted up completely internally) the red cord broke when I was pulling it, that's how badly it was jammed up. I think if you have an electrical problem then the red cord will probably work... What I was scratching my head about was.. the elapsed time between the last fill was probably a couple of weeks before I couldn't open mine.. in that time it had rusted solid.."
cue2,"Is there any access to the bit that corrodes, to lubricate it ?"
wictod,"You'd have to pull it out from the fuel flap assembly and check inside it to see if it already started rusting, my guess is the seal between the two section lets in water or it getting in through the rotating lock piece... the top section of the actuator with the electrical connection can detach from the main body (some careful prising off where it pops together) ... oddly enough the actuator is almost identical to the Audi A3 A7 one on amazon for £15.. with the only exception the Audi Amazon version has a square 2 pin connector, the Alfa has an oval 2 pin connection so some it may be possible to use the top off the original and fit it to the amazon version and then seal it properly with some silicon sealer.."
cue2,Not part of the service schedule when locks etc are checked though?
wictod,"I doubt it, it's a supposed sealed unit although mine was playing up for a long time before it totally seized.. the tell tale signs something's not right is the rotating lock piece is sticky in its rotating motion and doesn't close properly, having to repeatedly push the flap shut.. I tried silicon spray on the shaft but it didn't really help."
TheCrazyCabbage,"Correct, they're not part of a schedule, as Wictod said, they're supposed to be sealed for life. We ran into this fairly regularly. The other issue we have, although more prevelant on the Guilias, was the coloured cover warping and jamming the mechanism"
GVblue,"Bit off topic but interesting. Had my Giulia five years now and half way through every winter I have to take the aforementioned cover off and reform it over a hot ch radiator.On the other hand, our Stelvio, which we have now had for three years has never suffered from any self remodelling whatsoever.Guess we're bucking the trend."

The best way to describe them is they look like finger dents.They are on both sides in varying degrees. This has occurred now on both cars and now I take the opportunity to look at other Stelvio's and these too have in varying degrees the same dents in exactly the same place.Anybody else noticed or asked about how these have occurred?Spoken to the dealer and they say they were unaware of the issue until I pointed it out on 2 of the 4 used cars they had.Any one else?"

The guy at Autoshades is a perfectionist and picked up other slight defects, but not these. I wonder whether they have developed, maybe due to heat from the sun. Spoilt my day.

alfa1959,"Hi All,As per title.Today I notice the temperature creeping up and felt a vibration coming from engine bay, I managed to reach destination and investigated the problem.I noticed that the fan is touching the housing and it does not turn freely, it sticks in a certain point and needs some pressure to free.I don't know what to make of it.Anyone came across this before?Any input much appreciated.N.S."

Boca Mark,"Anyone having issues getting a fuel pump for a 2018 ti Stelvio Sport? Car’s been at the shop in So Fla for a month and being told there are no fuel pumps anywhere in the U. S. And, none in Europe for shipment to the U.S. Being told I’ll have to wait for Alfa to manufacture the part and send it with zero ETA.Is this par for the course with Alfa? This is my first.

jack_par,"Hey guys, nice to meet you all! I’ve already posted this in other forums but I thought to register myself on here too to compare an issue that I’m experiencing with other Stelvio owners.I’ll explain the problem below:I’m a music producer and an artist so sound system and speaker setup in the car is very important to me. Since I got my 2021 Stelvio in February, with H&K speaker setup, I had a weird ongoing issue that I thought Alfa technician solved yesterday but another problem came up. Basically what is happening is that the balance/fade in the audio settings is working incorrectly. When I got on the top left corner balance, the right tweeter is sounding but all the other speakers are on the left, when I move then to the top right corner, the left tweeeter is sounding and all the others sounds on the right side, so they’re basically inverted and, according to my experience, this is not how a balance is supposed to work. The balance on the rear speakers only though works fine when I move from left to right. Also, I never had a car doing this type of issue and others brands I checked they’re not behaving in this way, it’s a simple left/right balance.Yesterday I picked up the car that was in an Alfa garage for 2 days and they told me that, after a long inspection on the car and comparing that with other 2021 models, they realise that they were all doing the same thing and the technician discovered that the tweeter wiring is inverted on the amplifier in the car from factory, so he switched them and the balance was fixed and the speaker system was sounding amazing finally. It was all perfect and sounding great until I had to make a phone call and a very loud electrical noise is coming out from every speaker when I do or receive calls. I called the garage and they will need to check the car again to open a ticket with Alfa to understand why this is happening and if the tweeter are supposed to be inverted for some weird reasons. For that I’ll have to wait other two weeks unfortunately. The technician also told me that a 2020 model was doing the same issue with the balance so now they’re going to dig deeper to understand if that’s the way it’s supposed to work and, if that’s the case, I would love to understand why from the engineers. In my opinion the balance should not work like that. I did a song on purpose with lots of movement from left to right and it was always sounding inverted in the tweeter creating phase issues on the sound.I would very much appreciate if any of you guys on here could let me know your experiences with the sound system, H&K and factory ones, and if the balance is behaving in the same way in your cars, 2021 and newer or older model.Thank you so much all and looking forward to hearing from you. Hopefully we’ll get to the bottom of this and escalate it to Alfa."

Deman77,Wow. What a mess. That is probably why it sounds so bad with surround sound option ticked. Keep us posted. When they fix yours they will probably have an advisory ticket so we can all fix ours.I haven’t noticed on mine as I never felt the need to move left to right just back a bit. But now that you mentioned I will probably notice it.
jack_par,"Yeah I know, right? Absolutely incredible… we’ve checked other 3 Stelvio and it’s doing the same issue. I have an appointment back on the 10th May, I’ll know more by then.I’m from Italy so I posted the same issue in the Italian forum and it looks like Giulia and Stelvio with H&K works fine on the left/right balance and no issues with the phone, so it’s a great piece of information to give to the techinician.I’ll keep you guys updated on here."

,
Deman77,"Welcome, newbie. Giorgio platform cars (Stelvio/giulia) are fairly reliable - no worse than other cars which are packed full of tech. They are not quite to the standard of Toyota/Lexus but those are different league of reliability to anything else. Mechanically, they are solid. Most issues tend to come from wiring problems. There were some iffy brakes batches for some cars. In 19 car those would have been sorted by now.what is important is dealers. You want a good one somewhere nearby. It is not a given that there will be one nearby depending on part of the country you are in.I would not worry about keyless entry (this can be disabled) as much as radar vulnerability which allows to steal these cars in two minutes with a a couple of hundred quid worth of equipment. There is a solution for this now by a member here (@metalgod23) which will cost you 250 plus 50 to install. You can also add additional immobiliser in case your key is cloned.with my19 car be aware that this is pre mid life update (my20 onwards) which saw introduction of touch screen and new software. You might want to test drive one for comparison. No mechanical changes. Some cosmetics."
matty74,"If the car has a little button on each of the front doors then yes it has keyless entry. As stated It can be disabled via infotainment system. They’re great cars, we love oursGood LuckSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
supermario3,"Many thanks for the comprehensive update.So the 2019 model has infotainment with the wheel and physical buttons I assume?I used to have a mercedes 2016 c clas coupe and I could disable keyless by double pressing the lock bottom. For even extra security, I used to put my keys in the fob thing to block the signal.How does radar vulnerability work in terms of it being susceptible to theft?Thanks"
supermario3,Thanks for this!Never owned an Alfa before but heard various things about reliability. Assume this is for older models though.
cue2,"They are quite reliable. The Nero Edition was a Super model with bigger wheels and black trim parts. I don’t think it had keyless. I bought my Speciale new and it’s been great. You just need to look at the usual used car things and make sure it’s not been in stock long enough for the battery to go flat, from which any batteries often don’t recover. Stelvios were named by Auto Trader as the fastest selling used car a while back so that shouldn’t be a problem."
supermario3,Thanks- I've been told a few different things by dealers as to whether it's keyless or not! Can't find any nearby for me to actually check

cue2,All Stelvios have a start button. It works as long as you have the key. You have to push the button on the key to unlock the car unless you have passive entry.
cue2,"The thing you don’t get on the Super, and thus the Nero, unless fitted as an option, is Gear shift paddles on steering column. I think they were £270 extra but it’s much better to have them."

,
cue2,"Anyway, back to the Nero spec. It’s worth trying to stretch to a Speciale or Milano edition for the added features such as paddles and full leather electric seats. Also heated seats and steering wheel."
Isotope,"I think so, back in the days when Lancia sold cars in the UK most italian cars were made of recycled bean cans! I have had Alfa's since 2004 and they have been brilliant cars, I started with a 147JTD, Giulietta 2.0jtdm2, Giulia Speciale 2.2 and am currently on a 2.0 Stelvio Veloce. Reliability is not a problem on these cars anymore. I love the petrol Stelvio, but ironically it was the 147 that converted me to diesel. That car showcased what a turbo diesel car can do and the torque on all of the diesels was/is awesome. My Giulia didn't have the paddles, my Stelvio does, I didn't know them in the Giulia and if I'm honest I only ever use them to select D from P at traffic lights etc to avoid sitting on the brake pedal for prolonged periods. I wouldn't be put off a car without the paddles because most people will use it in automatic for most of the time!"
Isotope,"I think Milano spec became Veloce spec? Same power engine, but they offered LSD in 2022 models?"
cue2,"Having had a Giulia loaner I’d say it’s a different car without the paddles. I only use them to go into D or Neutral but it makes it much nicer. Also, the diesel in the Stelvio and Giulia has balancer shafts which make it much smoother than the one in the 147."
Alfie155,"Thinking about my use of the paddles, I probably only use them from R to D or P to D on a regular basis.They are also useful to force downshifts on steep descents to aid braking."
matty74,"Having lived with flappy paddles since 2017 I think the brilliance of the ZF gearbox has made us all a bit lazy. I regularly use the paddles in the same way as stated above but find that the hill descent change can be a bit too severe at times (some big hills near me) so blip up on the + to keep the revs lower on a descent.Drove back from St David’s earlier on the year in full manual and it was great fun, need to do that more really.To the OP, go for the best spec’d one you can afford.

supermario3,"Hey all,just purchased a Nero model and will pick up at the weekend - thanks for your feedback!I'm a bit nervous about the keyless start, I will buy a steering lock but can anyone suggest any other defence for the car?I think it was mentioned for something around £300 that can also help, but not sure what this isThanks"
Deman77,"Search for@metalgod23topics. He has radar vulnerability solution. Also you can get a CAN bus immobiliser - ghost , scorpion etc. That protects against hijack or the key being stolen from you.I would drop the steering wheel lock - massively reduces quality of ownership experience, can be cut off with enough will, just delays things. What’s worse unsuccessful attempt to cut it off often results in horrid damage to interior. Just accept that sophisticated and determined thief will take it. Put enough protection to deter less sophisticated ones but not so much that you swear each time you enter and exit."

Isotope,"If it's any consolation my 2021 Veloce had an update to the infotainment system at the last service and I now get black screens, no radio or reversing camera sometimes for as long as 10 minutes when I switch the car on. Its back at the dealers at the moment getting another update apparently. We had a 2017 Giulia before the Stelvio and the only thing problem we had in 2 years was a broken wire on the electric handbrake switch. It's my 4th Alfa and on the whole they all have been good reliable cars, I kept the Giulietta for 10 years and only sold it because I couldn't justify having 3 cars on the drive, don't let this put you off what I'm sure will be a great overall experience and I hope you enjoy how it drives??"
Isotope,"Picked my car up this afternoon, interesting that it had a DTC for the radio power button that needs replacing. I have had 2 occaisions when I've been out to the car on a morning and the battery was flat, I thought something had stopped the tailgate from closing properly(keeping the internal lights on) so this could be the cause of the flat battery's, so a new switch is on order. I also reported that during the cold weather my number plate lights worked intermittently turns out they have seen this before and they have fitted new connectors and lamp units as there was evidence of water ingress. My connect box was also in need of an update so we will see if we have got everything back to how it should be. My car is only 2 years old this month, so might be a heads up for anyone looking at buying an older car?"

metalgod23,"Yes. The only thing I need to verify/confirm is whether Alfa have fixed it with the latest face-lift cars being built. Hopefully I can get my hands on one to check soon. Otherwise all models and years up until now are affected,as long there is a radar up front."
supermario3,Is it more of an issue on the Quad models over the more standard spec such as Nero?
rjc147,The Quads are more desirable to thieves but being easy to steal via the radar all the models are vulnerable.
supermario3,"ThanksI can't believe Alfa haven't fixed this! I wish I knew before I purchased the stelvio, might have thought twice."
metalgod23,Thieves are targeting all desirable makes and models not just Alfa. Every manufacturer has some vulnerability. The unfortunate reality is we owners need to implement multiple layers of protection. This is one of them.

frustin,Any ideas if there's a way of redirecting the washer jet on the rear window? Mine sort of piddles straight down and washes only the top half of the window.
,
wictod,"I've got the same issue, I don't think you can change the direction of the jet externally, I'm planning on trying to remove spoiler on top of the tailgate to inspect inside. I'm not even sure how to remove it? compared with the 500x we've got the Stelvio rear jet is really weak for some reason, the fronts work ok but the rears seem to have a lack of power. Wondering whether it has a separate pump for the rear or there's a split in the line?"
frustin,I watched a YouTube of someone cleaning it out by squirting wd40 into the hole. I might try that
wictod,I've just bought this... can't go wrong for 6 quid unless is screws the nozzle up..Amazon.co.uk
frustin,please make sure you test and report
cue2,That’s a very sophisticated pin!
wictod,The sophisticated pin didn't work unfortunately.. the gadget itself is pretty good as the pin size is bigger than a needle but smaller than a paperclip in diameter and fits in the hole good.. I going to have to take the spoiler section off once I work out how to do it and inspect closely...
frustin,Any updates or tips for fixing this?
wictod,"No it's still frustrating me... I've bought a trim removal kit so I don't destroy the insides getting to the spoiler.. unfortunately there's no decent repair manual which explains the routing of the washer jets with blowup diagrams on the net etc (haven't bought the mopar tech subscription either) so have been relying on pictures of spoiler for sale on ebay to try and ID how to remove the spoiler. From these images it appears that once all the trim is off there's 3 bolt holding the spoiler to the tailgate section (not even sure if there's a seal to stop water getting in)... Plan is to wait until I have a dry fair day to inspect and I have a full day to myself to attempt it. The rear washer jet assembly can only be accessed with spoiler off... I'm hoping once I guess access to it the problem is obvious.. either split in the pipe joining the assembly, or some crud blocking the assembly making the jet useless.. If it's not local the rear jet assembly then I'll have to look elsewhere.. Oddly enough over the winter, my Mrs 500x was losing fluid and the back washer was weak.. refilled the washer bottle several times and saw some fluid leaking out from beneath the engine area... eventually found the whole passenger rear foot well swimming in fluid.. The leak was actually a split pipe that was routed through the internal trim on the passenger side at the sill level behind the plastic trim.. how it split I don't know but caused a right mess.. So in summary still a work in progress for me but will update when I get round to it.."
wictod,"I now have this fixed but it's a bit of a pain and need to call in reinforcements to help me.. took it down my local Alfa Specialist to get the tailgate spoiler removed. Basically, there's 5 10mm hex nuts that secure the spoiler to the tailgate. These are supplemented by a number of plastic pop fit studs an retainers. The 10mm nuts are accessible by removing the tailgate inner trim. It all has to come off I'm afraid.You then need some force to separate the spoiler from the tailgate once the 10mm nuts have been removed. Luckily none of the plastic pop fasteners broke off in the process.Once the spoiler is removed you need to replace the washer jet which part number ""Alfa 50547315 SPRINKLE"" cost me £20With regard to the fault in the first place ""slow dribbling jet"" what we found was the original part had lost the ball which is part of the assembly (see attached pic). Apparently the ball is some kind of safety pressure relief valve.. one can only assume that because I didn't have the -10c / -20c screen wash in at some point the water froze / expanded and popped the ball out. The ball was rattling around in the spoiler and dropped out and lost in the garage forever.Tip for fitting: 1. Snapping the assembly into position is difficult unless you warm the replacement in hot water beforehand. 2. Check the orientation of the nozzle eye relative to fitting.. the replacement was180 degrees outwith the eye facing towards the sky and not the screen (probably some cruel joke from Alfa parts).. lucky we checked before bolting it back together.Cheers"

Without the Apple Carplay etc., the infotainment option is pretty useless. Are there any upgrade paths via Alfa Romeo or 3rd party solutions that could bring it out of the dark ages? Current firmware is 002.007.036. Thanks in advance"

matty74,"You’ll probably want to upgrade to the final release of Gen 1, think it gives a slightly larger reverse screen.I had Gen 1 for 4 years on my Giulia, I wouldn’t say it was useless, I did however fit a unit similar to the Eng Custom to facilitate CarPlay at a later date, so I get your point.Welcome to the forum"
Alfie155,"I quite like the N, E, S, W compass direction in top right of centre display.Stuck in traffic the other day so had a play with some of the menu options and found the actual compass.Left it running as we moved away and got to wondering what the marked icon means. The distance in yards kept fluctuating up or down and we never reached whatever it is that thatView attachment 987710icon denotes. Any ideas?"
,
Virginijus-VJ,Could it be the elevation?
armoore,"Elevation for Hersham is given as 66 feet above sea level but that could be at a certain position within Hersham so accounting for where the vehicle actually is that could be correct.However the lat long on an aviation chart gives a position between a glider field (Rivar Hill), some way away, and Tidcombe I think. The elevation for the glider field is given as 730’."
Alfie155,"Interesting. Heights on maps are usually given in feet or metres rather than yards so I'd ruled that out.The pic was taken reasonably near Hersham on a dead straight N/S Road (Seven Hiils Rd) hence the 179°S reading. Some way from the other places you mention, though."
Virginijus-VJ,"Ive read some stuff on Google after your post, and few mentioned, that newer SatNavs use yards instead or feet or meters. For some reason."
MultiDoc,It's elevation indeed and you can change units via the infotainment settings (i have it in meters myself)
Alfie155,Altimeter it is then. I went to a couple of places where I knew the spot height from Ordnance Survey maps and it seems to be reasonably accurate.Mental multiplication ✖ 3 to convert to feet us fine by me. Strange theres nothing in the manual about it as its a neat little feature.
armoore,You never know when you may need to go onto oxygen!

GVblue,"After two and a half years of happy and glorious motoring our 2020 Veloce has thrown the inevitable major wobbly.My wife set off for work this morning and on the way there the dashboard did the well known Christmas tree impression. Fortunately, she was only a couple miles away from home so she managed to return safely, albeit a little stressed.The car is now on charge but I doubt the battery is at fault as I regularly use a Ctek. The car has also been doing silly little things since its last service when some sort of software update was carried out. The parking sensors and camera stopped working for a short period, the motor didn't respond to the stop button on a couple of occasions and the USB ports are all dead.Just about to ring the dealer now to see how long I need to wait for an appointment."
,
Deman77,Sounds like a mouse moved into your wiring and slowly feeding on it. Hope they sort it out quick.a couple of things to do whilst you wait.a cheap OBD tool per@metalgod23suggestion was a life saver for me when a one off engine check light repeated itself a month after it happened first time shortly after my second service (which included software update) and the car went into stuck check engine light and the limp mode. It allowed me to check it was nothing major (some abs unit communication codes) whilst I was waiting for an appointment and clear the codes so the car would drive normally. As expected there was nothing found by the dealer and they just sent me home. It’s worth having on you in case you get codes somewhere in a long trip.Do you run a Bluetooth battery monitor? It is not a given that your battery is fine because you regularly charge it as it is not a given it is knackered when you don’t. I found stock management of the battery worked fine for me and my CTEK ha been gathering dust - I will do a shock programme once in spring for prophylactic reasons.
GVblue,"Can't see any teeth marks under the bonnet but we do have lots of squirrels in the area.I do have a ""cheap OBD tool"" but, as is always the case, the faults have now cleared themselves, no doubt waiting to re-emerge the next time my wife is driving the car, thus causing maximum panic.I don't have a Bluetooth battery monitor, maybe Alfas should have them as standard. I'll probably just fit a new battery instead.I've never done and don't know what a ""shock programme"" entails and I'm not sure what I do with the prophylactic. Do I wear it or do I put it on the gear knob., but thanks for your thoughts."
Deman77,10-20quid gadget from eBay or Amazon and a standard app. 10min to fit it in stelvio. You will get to know your battery a lot better. You can rule out battery problems. Just changing the battery is an expensive way to rule it out not to mention that battery should not go in two years so it means it could be smth else that is doing this. But you can tell if that something is draining your battery and then causing codes or just causing codes.ctek (at least my model) has a programme that improves battery health (some sort of detox)- you are supposed to run it once a year.
GVblue,"Ah right, my five year old Ctek doesn't doesn't have that facility.Will have a look for a monitor, hopefully find one not through Amazon, and check just what the battery is doing.I know you shouldn't need to change a battery after two years, but then neither should you have to fit a gizmo to check how 5hit that battery is."
GVblue,"I've just had a proper look at my Ctek 5 and you are correct Deman. It has what is described in the instructions as a 'Recond' step and it is advised that this programme is used, as you do, once a year.The four year old battery on my Giulia is currently on charge on this programme.Thanks for bringing this to my attention."
SickStu,Did the 'Recond' cure your Veloce ?I too am having intermittent Christmas tree dashboard issues on my '69 Milano.

Has the problem been fixed? Thanks"
gogsygtv,"I have this same issue - thought it was the battery as there were other electrical issues but I have just replaced it yesterday and no joy!I have tried both fobs / new batteries in each - same issue, new AGM 12V 800aH battery - same issue.So what happens is if the car has been sat for any length of time the doors the central locking will not work. Repeated pressing of the button it will eventually function, once its gone once it will then function fine (unlock/lock as normal). Boot release works every time no problem so I think its probably a sticky lock / faulty solenoid in one of the doors.This morning I tried the physical key in the drivers door lock and it was stiff so this does seem the likely cause .Couple of questions:Is there anywhere I can apply lube / scoosh some WD40 that might have a positive effect?Has anyone done this job on the Stelvio and is it possible to get the lock / solenoid out without having to take the door card off?This is driving me mad as the car is going to be sold with a new company car coming and its cost me a fortune this last 12 months even doing a lot of jobs DIY! Its going to be like trigger's broom (UK reference!) by the time someone gets it."
wictod,"I have had this situation a few times where the car won't unlock for about 30 mins or so with good fob batteries and repeated pressing of the button.. I was doing a job in London once and had to return to the car outside the job frequently, opening and closing to get stuff out the boot. I noticed a Tesla park up as I was approaching and he locked his doors and I couldn't get mine to open for about half hour. I assumed there was some interference in the 433mhz range that was blocking the signal of the fob.. Apparently this is not uncommon, only way to find out is to use a spectrum analyser to check if it's the signal being blocked."
gogsygtv,"That does seem possible although I do experience it irrespective of location and quite consistently after a period of inactivity. Usually 4-5 presses of the button does the trick and once its gone once it will unlock and relock quite happily. I can't help but think mechanically it is sticking after a period of rest and then once its overcome the initial resistance it is free again. Either because its dry of lube / suffered water ingress and corrosion or the solenoid is on its way out and lacking ""oomf""!"
wictod,"Yeah, it's a tricky one.. trying to think it through.. is the solenoid you mentioned local to each door or is it a master solenoid / relay that activates all of them? If one of the doors was sticky would it cancel the rest of them opening because it didn't get a positive signal back to the control unit. I know people will shudder but have you given the door a slap when it doesn't open... a little bit of vibration on the affected area if it's a mechanical issue might free it up?"
gogsygtv,"Thanks for the feedback, I did my best to fault find it, no single relay in the black box as far as I could see only a fuse.In the end I persevered with a few PTFE spray doses to the locks and latches. It seems to have sorted it now, might of been the lubrication, who knows!"
nenadh,I’ve had a similar problem on my 2019 Stelvio from almost day one(key fob not working properly). I have eventually convinced Alfa service department there is a fault. A new central control unit has been ordered and soon to be replaced under warranty. Wish me luck. Cheers
Isotope,I just noticed an option in the SatNav accessible from the recent menu. It has an option for SD2V destinations? Does anyone know what this might be I can't find anything SatNav related about SD2V?
,
manc350,Funny i noticed this tonight sending a route to the car from the app... SD2v is micro SD card.. maybe when you send a route it stores it ??
Isotope,Also is it possible to input co-ordinates into the Satnav instead of postcodes??
VeloceRosso,Sorry no idea what SD2v means but does anyone know if you can input favourite addresses that it will save please? I can’t seem to find it at all so maybe it isn’t possible.My old works Passat had a favourites function and I had about a hundred destinations saved in it - really useful.
SteveeGee,I've had the engine management light going on and off for a while now. Been to dealer yesterday and they've condemned the particulate matter sensor as faulty and cause of the EML. They've ordered one from Italy (no idea when it will arrive!) and said it is a common and current issue across many FCA cars for this sensor to fail apparently. Anyone else had same/similar or know of a tech note?
,
ianrm,Not personally but I work in a Garage and it is very common for the DPF pressure sensor to fail on any brand of car.
SteveeGee,"Is the DPF pressure sensor, the same as Particulate matter sensor? I thought the PMS was post DPF to check particulate in exhaust, basically soot sensor?"
cue2,I think the main point was that these parts are generic and if Alfa cars are suffering issues they are not alone.
Jetronic77,"Been diagnosing and changing these sensors left right and centre, and they are hard to get delivered. Wasn't on FCA cars though. but besides an annoying light, they dont do anything to engine performance or cause damage to the exhaust so it isnt the end of the world."
Bernard002,Looks like my car has it again its a Guilia though 70 plate that is twice in a year... should I be expecting this every year
MrSporty,Can anyone help in pointing out exactly where the Particulate Matter Sensor is located ?I've had a P24D100 error occur on and off for a short time now. The usual CEL and DNA disable occur and the local dealership just moan at me about not doing enough motorway miles to trigger sucessful DPF regens.I know it isnt either of the top 2 sensors visible on top of the DPF as when disconnected they trigger pressure and NOX sensor errors. I'm assuming its post DPF ?
JShakeriAlfa,"Did this fix your issue? I’m having similar on my Giulietta, and wondering if it’s as simple as a faulty sensor"
MrSporty,"I fixed it on my 19 Stelvio.The Particulate matter sensor is located at the very rear of the exhaust and fits in a boss like a NOX sensor.Initially I really struggled to find the exact part but realised that the sensor comes in 2 distinct parts. The sensor itself which bolts into the exhaust pipe and the sensor to CAN bus module.I acquired a used but very low mileage sensor from a 20 plate Fiat Doblo. Swapped just the sensor cable part over, leaving the existing CAN module in place, cleared the code and havent had it reappear since. Not a bad fix for 60 quid and 10 minutes rolling round on the floor."
Dabbersmate,Anyone know what this sticker on the door pillar of a 2019 Stelvio QV is?

alfaitalia,Im guessing type approval numbers.....?
shpuncik,it's some kind of homologation numbers. also if I remember right it describes different materials used to make car.
Muton,"Quick questions to see if this has happened to anyone else. I have a 2020 (facelift model) Stelvio Veloce. I have a Samsung S22 and for the last month, been plugging it into the car via a USB lead to get Android Auto working. It's been fine, all working properly.A couple of days ago, Android Auto stopped coming up when I plugged the phone in but ONLY on the USB port in the central console (where the wireless charging area is). It previously worked in this socket and the front main socket.I've done the basic checks, it's the socket and not anything else. It still charges the phone but won't start Android Auto on the car's main screen like it should when you plug in a phone. I've checked it's not the lead (the same lead works in the other socket), I've checked it's not my phone (the phone gives Android Auto when plugged into the main front socket). I've even plugged in my old phone and it fires up Android Auto from the main front USB socket but not the one in the central console. The conclusion is it's the car's socket, not my wires or phones.I've reset the car's settings but no joy, I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas on this one before I take it in and get it looked at.Thanks."

cue2,Axel Deep. Is he in a heavy metal band?
TheGrimJeeper,"No, that's Axel Depe."
cue2,It’s interesting that the hybrid stuff adds 200kg and this is noticeable. It makes it weigh almost the same as a Macan.
TheGrimJeeper,Yeah. I'm not convinced by MHEV. Unless there's a 48V electric-powered supercharger involved.
cue2,That’s the Grecale installation. MHEV.
Deman77,when it came out (a year or so ago) the reviews pretty much described it as softer edged Macan competition - more luxury than stelvio and less driver focus. But I don’t get how you can put 4cyl engine and call it luxury. 4cyl Macans are the ones to keep away from. Then the only grecale worth having is the trofeo. But you are paying for a performance engine with a plush but still small car. The ideal one would have been a 350bhp 6cyl - some downtuned nettuno with still great soundtrack. The other 200bhp is just not necessary in that car. Then it’s a bit hard to swallow 50% premium over QV for something will not be as keen as qv. So trofeo is purely a poser car. But then again if you don’t know any of this then it should be fine. It’s just I reckon if you were to go for maser image and luxury you may as well get the trofeo levante which would have the actual Ferrari v8. That is very special. It will still not handle great and is an old platform but it looks better than grecale and it has the room that a plush suv should have.
symon,It looks like a Large Ford Puma with a VW Golf steering wheel.Car designers running out of ideas?

alfaitalia,That wont be an issue for 99% of SUV owners where the most off roading they do will be bumping up on the kerb outside the school or cash point machine. People who really want to off road wont be looking at these sort of cars anyway. They will buy proper off roaders like old shape Defenders or solid axle Jeeps.

cue2,The private estates round here have unmade roads which would be driven at walking pace with a saloon car but a bit faster in an SUV.
Deman77,"Aside from being able to go over more than superficial kerb, and not scraping the bumper when parking, non-hardcore Suv can keep you on the road when things flood. Stelvio qv wading depth is 48cm. You run much higher risk with saloons of getting waterlocked engine or flooding the car. I recognise it’s not an every day thing. But in the last 3 winters I can think of 4-5 journeys I would have cancelled if I had a saloon. Not a game changer but it’s not all negatives."
alfaitalia,"That pretty impressive.....my old Grand Cherokee WJ (with, I'm sure you will agree , much more off road ability than a Stelvio) only has 51cm wade depth.....at least until I lifted it!"
LiamBates,Flooding seems to be a far more regular occurrence these days so I can see why a decent wade depth would be useful. I can think of quite a few occasions where I’ve had to turn round in the Brera!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

Fleagel,"Hi allThanks for letting me join the forum. I wondered if I could get a bit of advice on the following issue please.I have a 2018 Alfa Romeo Stevlio with about 28000 miles on the clock. This was a second hand purchase and came with a 3 warranty.I noticed that the steering wheel wasn't heating so through the warranty company, I booked this in at my local dealership that specialises in Hyundai and Alfa for a battery charge and diagnostic inspection. No problems with this at all.However, when collecting the car the next day from the dealership, their free 'vehicle health check' picked up an Engine Management Light (A in a circle with an exclamation mark and the message ""Start & Stop unavailable"") They stated this was due to a fault in the bonnet catch switch. The replacement would cost £143.88.I questioned this as there had been no issues prior to dropping it off and I'd checked under the bonnet at the weekend and everything was fine. Driving after that at the weekend and to the garage with no problem warning lights at all. Their response was that the warning light was on when their technician got in the car to drive it into the garage. They said it was a frequent issue they encountered on Stelvios. They didn't call me to notify me at that time, only when I questioned it the next day.Is it likely that the warning light would suddenly appear after I've left the car perfectly fine and someone else has driven it but without even doing anything to the bonnet?If unlikely, any ideas on the best course of action?I've not had the repair done as I feel this all seems a bit too convenient.Don't know if this helps but I work from home so I don't use the car a great deal - school runs a few times a week and out for trips at the weekend.Many thanks guys."
,
Deman77,If it does not keep reoccurring there is no pressing need to fix it. Why wasn’t covered by warranty? Or was 3y from 2018?Did they sort out your main issue?
TheGrimJeeper,Did they have the bonnet open when testing? 🤭
VeloceRosso,Was this “local dealership that specialises in Hyundai and Alfa” in Derbyshire by any chance?
MadMotoUK,A bonnet switch makes stop/start unavailable? I'd say it's more battery voltage related.
cue2,The bonnet has latches on two sides and perhaps it’s unsafe to drive with one unlatched. It will probably set off the break-in-attempted warning.
sprint_veloce,If you've got the bonnet open checking something do you really want the engine to start unexpectedly? I'm pretty sure Alfa will not want that to happen.
TheGrimJeeper,My bonnet switch starts the engine.
Tickets,"If the dealer is using main dealer diagnostics there is a good chance the “fault” if there is one, will be time stamped. It might be worth asking for the information and see if it correlates."
Fleagel,Hi allMany thanks for the replied.Waiting on the garage to call me back as although they said the heated steering wheel wasn't working due to low battery and kept the car over night to charge the battery up - it's still not working.Will ask about the diagnostics as I do want to get to the bottom of why there's suddenly now an error requiring a new bonnet latch for £150+ which appeared before they'd opened the bonnet.@VeloceRosso- yep the very same. I take it you've previous experience of this garage? What happened?
VeloceRosso,"Only used them for servicing - first time it was fine (apart from not being at all interested in swapping out the battery which died a death at 6mths old unless I “left it with them for a few days” which I wasn’t prepared to do.Second time (after the takeover) was just a joke - total lack of contact, reception had no clue what the workshop were doing (not much it seems!), didn’t return phone calls and the car wasn’t even ready until the next day despite assurance it would be ready to collect by 4pm.No paperwork given and very rude staff when I went in a couple of days later to ask for an invoice.Very disappointed- I think I’ll try Stoneacre at Chesterfield for it’s next service.I hope you get a resolve on yours Fleagel"
cue2,They quote the lowest new sales prices but hopeless once you have taken delivery?
bobbybox,"A closed bonnet signal from both bonnet catches is required to enable Stop/Start (S/S). This is to prevent a car that is stopped because S/S stopped the engine from suddenly restarting automatically if the engine bay is open, an unlikely but mandatory safety condition that must be accounted for in the S/S system design. It is one of a number of conditions that must be met for the S/S to work. e.g. drivers door closed, drivers seatbelt fastened, engine to temp etc. And battery must be above 70% charged.Catches can fail. The failure can throw a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) message which can be read via diagnostics (all without opening the bonnet). If the warranty was started when the car was purchased (used as OP mentioned) then I'd have thought a claim for the catch could be made, unless of course such items are not covered (you'd need to see the warranty documents to be sure).The S/S unavailable message would prompt the technician to read any stored DTC's in the vehicle which is when they would have seen the faulty bonnet catch error code. I'd be surprised if it were foul play, It doesn't really matter how or when it happened, just that it did.Good luck.BB"

Deman77,"Started getting intermittent ticking from front outside wheel. Sounds like something in the calliper or a stone or screw in a tyre. Level car it happens on full lock (more left, less right) or with straight wheels when weight transfers forward during braking, or sweeping left turn when weight transfer into front outside wheel.First I thought stones stuck in sipes in winter tyres but having taken them all out that is not it.The sound is metallic and intermittent.I expect the usual three week diagnostic wait at the dealer, so would be good to have some ideas."
,
MultiDoc,No great ideas from me but keep us posted please if/when you find the culprit
Deman77,There is an advisory to deal with it from Alfa. I think they fit a spacer. Meant to be fitting one soon. I realised my tyres were nearly 2psi over spec max just before going on a long trip. I wonder if that was causing the issue. I’ve done all the way to Scotland on correct spec pressure and not heard the tick but I need to try in a quiet car park on full lock to make sure. I prefer not to fit the spacer of I can help it.
Isotope,"When you say outside do you mean the wheel on the outside of a corner or is it just on one side? I would be very interested in the Alfa Advisory or is this just the Ackerman affect again, noticed by a new owner?? You will get it at low speeds on tight corners but over 20mph and I would be surprised? If that sounds familiar it is one of the reasons why the cars go so well around corners and is not a problem."
Deman77,You’d think after over two years of owning the car I would know what Ackerman effect feels like.Besides you never get that on soft winter tyres.
Isotope,You will also get a more marked sound on colder tyres!
Isotope,"Just trying to be helpful, as I said cold summer tyres do it all the time on my car1"
Isotope,It literally goes bang bang every metre or so on full lock.
Deman77,"Some info hereBang like a broken suspension. Not ticking like a stone in a tread.Here is more info on thisClicking noise when turning wheel sharpI started to hear this a couple weeks ago. It seems to be getting a bit worse now. When I'm making a hard turn to the right mostly, sometimes to the left, there's a clicking noise that I hear. Has anyone else ever experienced this? I'm going to take it to the dealership next week.www.stelvioforum.com"
Isotope,So its a noise in high speed corners? My bad! I'm talking about noises at around 5-15mph and colder weather really does amplify the effect on summer tyres. Which we only have in the UK unless you ask for something different.
Isotope,If you really are fitting different tyres for the season a soft winter tyre won't make as much noise as a hard cold summer tyre at the same low temperature!
Deman77,"Full lock slow speed, slowing down straight wheels and sweeping corners at high speed."
Isotope,You shouldn't get any noise in a straight line at any speed?
Isotope,"I wouldn't expect a 3 year old car to need new wheel bearings but I am running out of options from what you have described, might be a heavily corroded/scored disk, thinking back to my 2017 Giulia and the rear disks were scored like many others on here??"
MultiDoc,"Deman77 said:Some info hereBang like a broken suspension. Not ticking like a stone in a tread.Here is more info on thisClicking noise when turning wheel sharpI started to hear this a couple weeks ago. It seems to be getting a bit worse now. When I'm making a hard turn to the right mostly, sometimes to the left, there's a clicking noise that I hear. Has anyone else ever experienced this? I'm going to take it to the dealership next week.www.stelvioforum.comClick to expand...Had that last summer myself. It wasonly present/audible in warm weather at slow speeds and while turning only. Eventualy they did fix it by applying the service bulletin as per Alfa at the dealership."
wictod,What was in the service bulletin that they fixed?
Deman77,Seems to have gone post the SB.See the link I posted earlier. Some sort of spacer goes on to stop brake callipers catching.
Jambo,"I generally always run a little over pressure (i just prefer the wear on the tyres, and i think it feels better even if a little bumpy) but i've no ticking noise to note in 19 months.I do also remember something about a spacer for a similar reported issue."
bazza,"This is a daft possibility, but you never know.Have you just had the wheel rebalanced (had a new tyre fitted)? Could be that a balance weight has been fitted such that it's getting tapped by the caliper?"
Deman77,"It’s definitely that advisory. The spacer fixed it completely.The ticking noise was something catching. Trying to locate the exact point on the tyre when I thought it was a stone, just advancing a fraction of a turn super slow you could feel it was something building up tension then popping. At speed it sounds like ticking.Why I did not have it from new for two years is the question. I can only think it was suspension properly settling in. The car would typically only be used with a couple of kids or max all four of us and rarely with luggage - even then just an airport trip or an hour or two trip. It was at 10k before. Then I drove the fully loaded car at autobahn speeds to Italy. Things must have settled a bit and geometry changed fractionally."
GaryMJ,Hi alljust reaching out to see if anyone knows if it’s possible to replace the exhaust tips without completely removing the rear bumper section ?Looking to replace mine for the black ones.Thank youGJ
,
GaryMJ,Decided to paint mine as trial. If that doesn’t work out then I guess I’ll stump up the cash and buy the OEM ones and start pulling the car apart to fit them. I’ll put some photos for anyone that’s interested.
GaryMJ,Well i almost got it finished.
GaryMJ,£7.50 ! Job done lets see how they wear !
Deman77,I was going to reply hammeride for fire places but thought you would find it insulting.I would try and get little metal cones to smoothly join the actual pipe to the outside pipe (frustrum rather - I know I have an 8 year old so I know obscure shape names and useless parts of plants).Real pipe showing up inside a fake fat tip or worse still double tip (like amg43) always looks cheap. You can see them driving behind the cars. I didn’t know Stelvio one was a fake until I parked behind one.If you join the inside pipe to outside you can have a better look. You can probably just cut a thin stainless sheet with metal cutters and bend it Over a cardboard shape then paint it inside and put it in with a cut at the top so it can’t be seen.
GaryMJ,Hi DemanI get your point but joining the exhaust to a solid point could cause a problem. Besides I have seen far worse fakery on other vehicles some even have tips when there’s not even a pipe there😲. The weirdest of all for me is the all electric Porcher Taycan Turbo ! TURBO Huh ?? 🤣
Deman77,They were beginning to grow on me. I will not be able to take them seriously now.
Muz,"Turbo electric with exhaust pipes, laughablei am not a fan of the real exhaust being so obvious within the exhaust on the Stelvio but it looks good from a distance."
Isotope,"@GaryMJI have the factory dark exhaust tips and I think you've managed to do an excellent job with yours, I don't think you could tell them apart! Good job fella!"
GaryMJ,That’s the best compliment you could have given me ! Thank you Isotope.Although it took me a while to find the right colour ( BMW black from Halfords would you believe )3 coats etch primer3 coats BMW black3 coats of clear coat.I tested the heat after a run and the tips don’t get hotter than the sun on your hood on a hot day so heat shouldn’t be a problem to the normal paint and clear coat. I hopeafter your comment I’m even more pleased with the result. Thank you !!
GaryMJ,I think that now completes the look I wantedStelvio Milano Edizone (Nero)
GaryMJ,I agree although i found the black tips blend with the sooty exhaust much better you can barely see them tucked away in there.
GaryMJ,
VeloceRosso,Looks great - nice job!
Deman77,"I was behind an oldish 911 today and it had the end of the narrower inside pipe joined up to the outside fat tip. It looked good. I’d give that a try. If it’s not getting that hot, may be even aluminium sheet will do. It’s more pliable and will soot up in a month so no need to paint."

GaryMJ,Your right ! Wow. Im well happy with that. Amazing considering i used a rattle can in my garage LOL. Thanks for adding the photo.Anyone that wants a similar result and not brave enough (like me) to pull the rear bumper off (Halfords BMW black) over etch primer And 3 coats of clear lacquer.Love the colour keyed bumper too Isotope. I may not attempt to re-spray mine though

,
Top Down,"There is problem you might create there. The Porker's tip will be part of the exhaust, the Giulia and Stelvio tip is fixed to the bumper, as the exhaust is on rubber mounts it can move a little, not much its true, but you could get a rattle."
Isotope,"The MY21 cars have no black trim around the bumpers and wheel arches its all body coloured is smooth as well. I wouldn't recommend trying to paint yours as it would look like orange peel, which every painter tries to avoid!!"
GaryMJ,Agreed ! I’m content with the result I got now. I do like the look yours gets though with the coded plastics 👊. I just noticed tonight how dark and deep the Rosso red goes around twilight wow it was like a deep burgundy. So cool.
cue2,I’ve replaced my Stelvio exhaust tips for OEM black parts so have the chrome originals if anybody wants to buy them. (You could paint them black then switch them over. If anybody is interested I can get them painted.)
stelviowner,"I am going to be leaving my Stelvio for a short to medium time on my drive at home but not in use. Not possible to run it periodically so I am considering taking the battery off it to save the battery. I did this once before with the battery left on the car for a shorter time and it was real touch and go getting the car livened up again.Looking for guidance concerning the shut down and restart.By disconnecting the battery to remove it, I am unable to power close/lock the tailgate therefore my plan is to open the bonnet and jump lead the battery to the under bonnet engine jump lead points in order to power the tailgate shut, and to lock the doors. Disconnecting the battery from the jump point and dropping the bonnet closed should leave the car secure and not killing the battery.To restart the car at a later date my plan is to open the drivers door with the physical key from the fob, open the bonnet, attach the battery to the jump lead point to hopefully get the tailgate to unlock and open then re-attatch the battery and hopefully start the car.Does this sound feasible or am I making a huge mistake. It is not practical to leave the car on a maintainer instead.Helpful advice welcomed."

matty74,"Faced with the same dilemma I’d take the boot floor mat out and leave the rear seats unlatched so it could be folded down to reconnect quick release (-) on battery.This is assuming you can open the rear door from the inside once you’ve opened the driver door with the key, can’t see why not.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
stelviowner,"Hi there.Good idea. I went to considerable expense when I bought the car to obtain a spare wheel which sits over the battery, but, no reason I can't lift it out and put it aside thereby allowing acces to the battery in situ.I don't know nearly enough about the car to say whether the rear doors will open from the inside handle with the battery off. Whether they are operated by physical wire or powered release actuator from inside I have no idea. If I lay the rear seats down also, I would have pretty decent access by following what you suggest.Leaving the battery in the car will save a good deal of bother and the result will be essentially the same as removing it and if the bad guys come calling once they are in the car with the battery it is game over anyway. Although with the battery disconnected I imagine the more high tec methods of accessing the Stelvio will be non-starters leaving the only recourse of the low tec house brick.So, thank you for this response, you have made an insightful and helpful suggestion, I will in all probability do as you suggest. Thank You again.Just a late afterthought. I assume you can lock the drivers door with the key as well as open it with the car unpowered. Logic and common sense says yes, of course, why not, but we are dealing with Alfa here."
mikesalfa,Sometimes scenarios like this are outlined in the owners manual. You could have a look there as well.
stelviowner,Thank you for the advice.
pocholin,"Yes, you can lock and unlock the driver's door manually. There's a little cover on the rear door, you need to remove that in order to access the release cable.I suggest doing this in the following order:Lower the left side seatRemove the cover from the doorClose all doors and lock themOpen your trunkDisconnect the batteryClose the trunkWhen you're back, you will need to open the driver door with the key, then open the rear door from the inside to access the rear are, get in and pull that release cable.Good luck."

I looked in the back of my car and on the inside of the tailgate there is indeed a small plastic access panel which when removed reveals a wire loop to trigger the lock.One small question..When I close the tailgate normally it closes on its motor, then once closed another motor runs and the tailgate pulls down more firmly into place and is secured. If I disconnect the battery before closing the tailgate, will it lock or will it be waiting for power in order to run the lock motor. Sorry to be thick.Many thanks for your advice it is much appreciated and helpful."
pocholin,The latch will still lock it when you pull the door down.
stelviowner,That is fab information. One thing I was factoring into my original plan was to leave the car powered via jump leads to the jump start buss bar under the bonnet in order to close and lock the tailgate. If as you say it will lock mechanically without power available I can alter what I need to do a lot. As far as you know does the car come back to life ok after being disconnected for a while or does it give you grief ?
pocholin,"It will lock for sure. All kinds of lights will lit up when you turn the car back on. Turn the string wheel all the way to the left, then to the right, drive it to 20 MPH, switch it off then back on...all light should be off by then."
stelviowner,You have been very helpful. Thank you. I now have a plan 👍👍
Isotope,I quite often connect my CTEK charger to the jump start connectors to keep the battery topped up. If you can't connect the car to a maintainer have you considered a solar charger??
stelviowner,Hi there.In all honesty no I haven't but thank you for the suggestion. And if the car is left for a couple of months I'm not sure leaving it on a semi constant charge would be the greatest.
Isotope,I've no experience of the solar chargers that are available but might be a good option?
stelviowner,👍👍
stelviowner,"Nobody mentioned that once you have locked the car with the remote and you then remove the battery connector before slamming the tailgate down the bloody alarm goes off FOR AGES. although it eventually stops itself, by which time none of your neighbours are talking to you. Did start to wonder if my ignore it bluff was going to work but thankfully it did."
legacy,"Hi I have searched various threads for info but wanted information on my specific problem.Whilst driving in the wind snd rain the car just came to a stop. All the engine check lights came on like a Christmas tree. I tried to restart the car but no joy. I carry a OBD and checked for errors there were three, sorry can't remember what they were, I think fuel rail, canbus, low voltage. I tried to clear the errors but they kept coming back. Called rescue and they managed to get the car started using battery pack.Got to the garage and they checked evrything but couldn't pinpoint the exact fault. As a last resort they checked the battery condition and it was down to approx 15%. The battery was only 3 years old and was an Alfa one. They changed the battery and off I went. The stop start and rear screen still doesn't work, which I'm not bothered about the SS.Why would a low battery cause the car to die? Also why had't the alternator kept the battery at a healthy charge. Never remembering it happening in the old days with just an altenator and lead acid battery.Would love for someone to put some light on the problem."
,
wictod,"The battery failing is not uncommon, although to such a drastic degree without noticing it was going downhill is unusual. Typical symptoms of the battery failing are the stop / start doesn't work as the battery charge on full gets below 12.3 volts. I think there are also other symptoms. If you didn't notice anything before it totally failed I can only assume the battery went bad relatively quickly? Mine had one dead cell and they replaced under warranty. Since that I have a battery monitor added and carry a jump pack under the front seat just in case. Far too many reports of battery issues and the next battery I get will be an AGM version as these appear to hold up for longer. There's a lot of technical talk about the intelligent battery module being a problem but I can't comment personally as it's all too technical.. Hopefully the garage diagnosed that the battery was only able to hold 15% of its potential (dead cells and totally duff) and not just 15% charged as that may imply the problem could be the alternator or battery intelligent system.. Regards the stop / start not working now... this usually takes about 3 to 5 switch off and restarts before something resets after a battery change and after that it should continue to work normally.. Hope the battery solves the problem.. hate reading posts like this the motors just randomly fail .. ..."

,
Deman77,If you enjoy your music in decent quality then you can note a reasonable step up in quality by connecting with a wire vs the BT. If you are happy with BT quality it’s only fair that you cannot adjust the equaliser settings - Alfa must think: this guy will take it as is.I am testing carlinkit wireless CarPlay dongle today which should give the convenience of wireless without the quality drop. Will feedback after a long trip this weekend.
manc350,"Thanks Deman77, look forward to feedback.The only reason it irks is that using BT on my wife's Merc or on my old 2016 Jeep GC Overland both allowed a decent amount of adjustment and not too much difference from line in TBH. .. .only seems to be the Stelvio that doesn't... i use high bit rate on Spotify so only download the better quality tracks..."
sprint_veloce,You've tried various phones via Bluetooth and they all have the same issue?

Got my big uk sticker, all the bits i need to have for police check.Now I didn’t see a setting to switch the light patter to left hand drive like I had in my Volvo. So I picked up some eurolites. But driving the other day in the dark I paid attention to the pattern and it looks identical left and right. Should I bother with the eurolites?I assume all stelvio lights are the same xenon units (at least eurolites chart does not differentiate). Can someone confirm or correct this in case I need to think QV specifically."
,
shpuncik,Stelvio was equipped with either halogen or xenon headlights. some markets didn't get halogen. nevertheless beam pattern differs on UK/EU headlights whether they are halogen or xenon.
TheGrimJeeper,Did you check the manual?
Deman77,For a split second there I thought they actually had a hidden setting somewhere.
shpuncik,all Stelvios with xenon headlights are 35W and don't have manual height adjuster
alfaitalia,It wont correct the beam pattern with the height adjuster anyway....thats just for when you have a heavy load in the boot and need to bring the lights down.. You need beam benders/correctors.

AshleyJU,"Had my first CEL experience this morning, on cold start I noticed my engine running rough and misfiring. shortly after the dash decided to throw a flashing CEL after a short (slow) drive and a quick engine restart the misfiring stopped and the car drove okay (didn't push it) CEL remained and I continued on my journey.After leaving my car for a period of a few hours I returned, started the engine and again experienced the same issue, misfiring and a strong petrol smell. Quick engine restart again allowed me to continue my journey slowly without issue. Once I got home I connected MES and logged the following error codes..P0303-00 - Cylinder 3 ignition failuresP0300-00 - Ignition failures (generic)P0363-00 - Ignition failures (generic)My Stelvio has done just under 40k, and only last week I had my local Alfa dealer change the serpentine belt. I will be planning a trip back to the dealer to have them investigate this issue, however in the meantime if anyone has experience of this any advice would be greatly appreciated."
,
AshleyJU,"UPDATE:Booked in with the main dealer, Sparkplugs are on order and will be changed anyway as they are due. After reading various posts on the Giulia and Stelvio forums the guys in the US have had similar issues related to the Aux belt tension, although the tension looks okay the inbuilt guide would suggest otherwise. As highlighted within the original post, my Aux belt was changed by this dealer less than 100 miles ago, so potentially something's not right.There's always the possibility this is just a coincidence, and not related to the Aux belt change. My thinking would be either Spark Plugs, Coil Packs or the MultiAir unit. I'll keep you all updated on this, as it may assist other people in the future.Please see the image, you can see the guide on my Aux belt tensioner is pointing towards the left, this is what you would typically see with a stretched belt as far as I understand."
AshleyJU,"UPDATE #2:Spark Plugs have been changed, but she's still not running perfectly or maybe my senses are just more heightened to the issue. Anyway, booked in to visit the main dealer as planned on Monday; will post any updates in due course.I've been assured it's unlikely to be related to the Aux belt tension so hopefully just a coincidence.I've added a picture of the old spark plugs for reference."
Isotope,"Your spark plugs look okay to me, if a spark plug wasn't working it would stand out as wet or oily, however a faulty coil pack only has to misfire every couple of revs to cause rough running. I don't know enough about the newer engines but it could also be a camshaft (TDC) sensor on it's way out The tensioner and or the serpentine belt has no influence whatsoever on the engine timing so I can't imagine your issues are related to that unless they disturbed the wiring of a sensor related to engine timing. The engine in the Stelvio is longitudinal so it should be very easy to see/find and work on, most things on a transverse engine layout eg Giulietta are much harder to get to and work on because there's engine mounts in the way and or clutch bellhousings and very little clearance between the pulleys and wheel arch bulkheads so again this would be a very rare issue given the work that you have had done? I haven't seen any reported issues with Stelvio Multiair units but oil quality/brand has been an issue on the Giuliettas and Fiats with Multiair units. Hopefully that won't be your issue?"

Service-wise, it's always been done at the main dealer, Selenia Digitek PE for the first two then Fuchs Titan GT1 Pro for the last one which meets the FIAT 955535-GS1 standard. The car still has the Manufacturer's warranty so hopefully, anything outside the service schedule will be covered. Suppose I'll have to wait for the dealer to do some diagnostics and report further, I'm just concerned they'll scan the ECU tell me what I already know, reset and send me on my way.... I'll try to be optimistic!"

Fortunately, it was covered and replaced under warranty.Hopefully, this isn't a common fault and I don't experience it again within another 40k miles.

I'll still be taking it to my local specialist for servicing, but so far, so good."
solaris998,"Well I know of one other Stelvio diagnosed with a Multiair issue, he had the same issue as you with misfiring. He is one of the guys in the Gloucester Alfa Group, it was diagnosed this week."
cue2,This MA issue is also relevant to the Giulia using the same engine?
AshleyJU,"I presume so, I've seen posts similar to this on the US forums but not too many in the UK/EU. It has been suggested the most likely culprit is incorrect spec oil and/or infrequent changes outside the service schedule.However in my case oil changes have all been on time and correct spec oils have been used, mostly Selinia Digitek; with the one before the MA replacement being Fuchs Titan GT1 Pro which also meets the required ACEA C2 and FIAT 9.55535-DS1/GS1 specifications along with all servicing being completed by the main dealer.Going forward I'll be using my local specialist which always uses Selinia oils so I'll keep an eye out for further issues. That being said, based on the information above I'm truly hoping I won't see this issue again... after all my MA unit was replaced at under 40k miles, and I don't fancy having to deal with this again when I'm outside my warranty period. Quick question.. does anyone know if I can purchase an extended warranty from Alfa, Mine is due to end in 2025, if possible I would like to extend it a little longer for obvious reasons."

gunduz,"I got the CarlinKit CarPlay Adapter (89 onautokitcarplay) to enable wireless CarPlay in my 2019 Giulia.TLDR:It has worked excellently, it’s fast to boot up, and I haven’t had any failure or glitches yet. For the few drives I’ve done my music is playing by the time I’ve backed out of my parking spot and started to pull forward. I will likely continue using this until Giulia enables native wireless CarPlay.Pros:Fast bootup ~40secsAutomatically connects to your phoneNo glitches in audio on highest qualityEasy to change settingsWorks just like it shouldWIRELESS CHARGER IS ACTUALLY USEFUL NOWCons:Slight input lagSlight audio lagSlow to disconnect when leaving car (seems to be due to the car)Flashing green light when connectedMounting:I mounted it between the two USB ports using a Command picture hanging strip (sort of like velcro but better). The unit is nice and small, and the provided short usb cable works well for this location, though an even shorter cable might be better. The cable is long enough for the box to sit in the bucket under the center console but I prefer the mounted solution. However in this location the light on the unit is annoying. The red when disconnected isn’t bad but the flashing green light is distracting, especially at night. You could mount it reversed from how I did it, or put a bit of electrical tape over the light.Connection:Connection to the phone works automatically, as long as your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are enabled. Connection is initiated via Bluetooth and then Wi-Fi details are shared to make the full data connection. At this point the phone’s Wi-Fi switch in control center will go white and you will be disconnected from any network you were previously on. Clicking the Wi-Fi switch will cause your phone to ask you if you would like to disconnect from CarPlay.You can set up multiple phones and the device will have them listed in a simple interface when it boots up. This interface can be disabled in the device settings and it will just show a black screen while it auto connects. Auto connection can also be turned off.Performance:I’ve only ever used wired CarPlay in the past so I can only compare to that - I’m not sure how much of what I describe here also applies to native wireless CarPlay. Input lag is slight, but manageable. Pressing buttons is responsive enough but when swiping on the Home Screen or panning the map the screen lags behind the finger a bit. I find this to be a reasonable compromise to be able to use CarPlay wirelessly.There is audio lag, the default is 1 sec. This seems to be so that the car can hold a buffer of audio so you don’t get glitches. You can adjust it in the device’s settings and it seems to work fine at the minimum of 300ms.Bootup:16 seconds until the light on the unit comes on.8 seconds later the head unit on the car says “Usb Connected”16 seconds later music is playingThis adds up to a total bootup time of 40 secs which I’ve found to be plenty fast enough in real life usage (it feels slower when you’re timing it). Unplugging/replugging the unit brings CarPlay back in 24 seconds so I think the fist 16 seconds are due to the car booting up. Plugging in wired car play takes about 4 seconds so it seems that this unit only adds about 20 seconds of delay total.Shutdown:It takes just over 3 minutes from when you open the car to when the device powers off and your phone reconnects to home Wi-Fi. This seems to be a limitation of the car cutting power to the socket. At about the 3 minute mark you get the notification that you left doors unlocked, then you hear the motor closing the air vent in the front grill, then it cuts power to the CarPlay USB port. I’ve found that walking into my house can be far enough to break the connection (I park right outside my door) otherwise you can hit the Wi-Fi switch in control center and disconnect manually. I personally don’t find this to be a huge deal, but I think native CarPlay from Giulia should probably disconnect instantly.Conclusion:Overall I find this product to be amazing and well worth the money to be able to use the wireless charger or leave your phone in your pocket. There are minor compromises but none of them are deal breakers for me. I hope that Giulia enables this natively (it definitely has the hardware), but for now I’m perfectly happy with this solution.I also have another unit that runs a full Android OS (full google play store available) that I will give a try, but I think I’ll probably stick with the CarlinKit."

OperationAlfa,"I thought i'd give you a run down of my thoughts of the Stelvio.I run a Cayenne Turbo as a daily driver and have had a good few hours behind the wheel of a Macan S, and I have also driven a Macan Turbo. I have a Giulia QV and also a 4C Spider. So a good range of different cars.I had the pleasure of driving the 280BHP petrol model at Millbrook on Saturday. No photos unfortunately as Millbrook is a closed site. There were a few events on the same day, some Aston Martin DB11's bombing around and a Mercedes van event.I enquired about the car at Geneva and I'm assuming this put me on the list for invites for this event.I'm actually after the QV model but this will not be released until 2018.So on to Millbrook. Alfa UK had to beg borrow and steal cars from Europe for the day, there were 5-6 Stelvios in total. We were given a 45 minute presentation from Naz and one of the guys from Centro Stile. He was originally at SRT in the US and came over to work in Italy. Really nice guy and a good presentation on the history of the brand and how they have tried to replicate the history and styling as best as possible into the Giulia and Stelvio. There are some really nice subtle changes to the Stelvio which he pointed out. Things you wouldn't really notice but do make a good difference. For example, the dash binnacles are more pronounced in the Stelvio and the entire dash is angle more towards the entire cabin than just the driver like it is in the Giulia.On to the 45 minute drive with the cars.The 2.2 Diesel and the 2.0 Petrol. Both look identical but the petrol had red callipers. The Ferrari esque 20"" alloys look really nice on the car. The diesels came with 19""s which also looked good. All sat on high profile tyres giving that very rugged off road look.I opted to drive the Petrol as the diesel is the devil in my opinion. (obviously for some the diesel will be the one to go for). First impressions, it feels just like a Giulia but somehow a little less composed presumably due to the ride height. You can definitely feel the difference in weight. The engine is pretty good from the off, albeit very quiet. So to start, we take the car on an off road course. Very bumpy terrain and high climbs and steep drops. The car behaves impeccably well over this terrain.Next we moved on to some loose gravel and it was good to throw the car around a little bit. The car is naturally rear wheel drive but when slip is detected up to 50% of the power is sent to the front wheels. It grips really well.Then we tried out the HDC (hill descent control). There are a number of settings here for the speed at which the vehicle can descend. Setting to 3-5 gives a very assured feel and foot off the brake down a very steep muddy drop was very impressive. This is on normal road tyres too not the nobbly off road type.After this off road course I was quite impressed. Next up was the Alpine Hill track where there are many dips and curves, off camber corners and climbs. The car is dynamically very capable with hardly any roll, although at times I felt it didn't feel as planted as it could be. The rear suspension feels a little tight and as a result the rear would step out marginally only to be corrected instantly by the front wheels coming into play. It was a little unnerving at first but you learn to trust the car and its quite good fun.The engine although very torquey and quick to spin up. It moves the Stelvio pretty quickly and with 3 up I wasn't complaining for power. The engine does sound very flat and its probably the most boring sounding engine I've ever heard in anAlfa.Thismakes me a little sad. The 2.0 twin spark was a really nice sounding engine, and even the JTS engines sounded pretty good. This just sounds dull and quite frankly a bit droney a high revs. It makes my 4C sounds like a Ferrari in comparison, not to mention the 2.9 V6 in the Giulia which sounds like Thor the god of thunder.Brakes are good and strong and again there would be no point in speccing the CCB's in the QV. Although I would need to drive it to be sure. Handling is good, the cabin noise is also better than the Giulia. It is a relatively swift car and pulls well even at motorway speed speed. I topped out at around 110 on the flat out straight and it was still pulling.So, what do I think. I'm waiting for the QV model. I believe the Macan is a very capable car and is better than the Base Stelvios but also a lot more expensive. The Stelvio is a really good car and I believe it will appeal to a lot of people. It's practical with folding down seats and a decent size boot. Perfect for a family. It's also not that high so doesn't feel too dissimilar to the Giulia.Stelvios are due for Launch in the UK around July time for Orders and deliveries in the last 3/4 months of the year. Dealer demos are due in August/September.Highlight of the day was being fired around the handling circuit by a BTCC driver in the Giulia in Race Mode. Going tandem around the track playing with the other Giulia was fantastic.Apologies if there are any spelling or grammar areas, I thought I'd put something together and correct it later on.Happy to answer any questions."

Keithy,"Thanks Joe, sounds like you had a great outing :thumbs:"
TheGrimJeeper,"Cool. Just saw one driving past my place on the road too. :thumbs:What tyres are they fitted with, Pirelli Scorpion Verdes?Also, how deep a water obstacle did you wade it through ...?"
trashbat,"Good review, but I have to ask: are you intending to end up with two Quads, a Giulia and a Stelvio? If so, why?I mean, they're surely both good and all, but if I was granted two wishes by the magic car genie, I wouldn't have two of effectively the same thing, unless I expected one to blow up and have to break it for parts..."
OperationAlfa,"Stelvio will replace the Giulia and the Cayenne will be going too. Downsizing to just the 4C, Stelvio and 500.TheGrimJeeper said:Cool. Just saw one driving past my place on the road too. :thumbs:What tyres are they fitted with, Pirelli Scorpion Verdes?Also, how deep a water obstacle did you wade it through ...?Click to expand...They were pirelli but I didn't check the exact model.Weren't allowed in the water so no idea. Which is sad as that's a fun part.What makes me a little sad is the DRL's are pretty much the same as one of the Renualt Crossovers. I think its the Kadjur."
TheGrimJeeper,"Oh the humanity!!!!:lol:Wading is a running joke between myself and GTLeigh.Scorpion Verde 4 season M&S, I bet."
Biscione1750,To the OP:Do you now if adaptive suspension and/or air suspension would be an option on Stelvio? I don't see it on AR Italy's configurator.Also would you say the ride height is about the same as the Macan?
OperationAlfa,"TheGrimJeeper said:Cool. Just saw one driving past my place on the road too. :thumbs:What tyres are they fitted with, Pirelli Scorpion Verdes?Also, how deep a water obstacle did you wade it through ...?Click to expand...Yes the ride height is pretty much the same as the Macan in my opinion.I was told by Alfa that the Adaptive suspension was going to be an option on the Stelvio. But as the car is still not officially released in the UK that could be subject to change."
smarty156,I was there on Saturday too and the hot laps in the Giulia were amazing. Did you notice if the car you were in was on Pirelli or Michelin tyres? The one I was in had Michelins on but I didn't see which ones (stupidly!). The grip was phenomenal. Sounds like you may have had the same driver as me too. He left the gearbox in auto (which was actually spot on) even though he was in Race mode. Did he do that with you?
OperationAlfa,I had Paul O'Neil. Full race mode with manual shifts. Michelin tyres. Progressive slip unlike the crap pirellis.
smarty156,"Yep, I had Paul O'Neil too. Maybe he was trying out Auto mode with me.Re the Stelvio, I was I'm the 280 hp petrol too. I think it would be ok if it allowed more engine noise into the cabin. Maybe louder middle exhaust box?"
Vipera,Very nice review.I was wondering if you could elaborate on Macan vs. Stelvio and why you believe the Macan to be better.
Isotope,I have a Stelvio Veloce and must admit that I have been thinking of getting a Macan next? I love Alfa's but there needs to be a model between the Veloce and the QV with about 360bhp!
cue2,You love Alfa’s what?
cue2,I’m considering a Grecale. I’d Never be seen driving an overweight Porsche..
Isotope,"The way they go around a corner, the way they look, the history, Enzo Ferrari worked for Alfa before he started up his spaceship company!! Now the Grecale Trofeo is a very nice car but you are looking at the thick end of £100k!"
Muton,"Hi, I'm selling my Giulia and I've found a great second-hand Stelvio Veloce to move into, it's a 2020 model (the newer version with the touch screen), 4-wheel drive and I wanted to know if it comes with a limited-slip differential?I know it doesn't have the performance pack but I'm seeing info that tells me that all Stelvio Veloce's come with an LSD, some places tell me they don't and it's an option to upgrade it. Does anyone know if they come as standard? Can anyone help? Thanks."
,
manc350,"HiI have a 2021 Veloce and had to add LSD as an option as it was not standard on that model year. Is it an Alfa dealer selling it, if not maybe the original order paperwork will show it if still with the car.."
Muton,"Thanks, I think that means if mines is from 2020, then it didn't come as standard and would have to be an optional extra. It's from a second-hand car dealer rather than a main dealership so their knowledge of the car is limited. I was just curious, (I don't think it's going to be a must-have for the family car)"
manc350,Hmmm... did not realise how much i used auto high beam on the Jeep.. really miss it on my Stelvio.Anyone had that enabled post sale ? is it possible to have it enabled for $$$
,
joephoto,"What year is your Stelvio? My 2021 (US model) has auto high beams, and it took a bit of effort when I first got the vehicle to figure out how they actually worked. (Different from other vehicles I have had)."
manc350,"Hi Joe, mine is also 2021 my veloce. But UK .."
joephoto,"Have you looked in the Setup menu to see if it is an option that you can enable? It was a 3-step process: 1. set the light switch to Auto, 2. enable auto high beam in the Setup menu, and 3. when the regular lights are on, push the high beam stalk forward."
pocholin,"When the lights are on your beam indicator lits green, that means the Auto high beam is engaged. Does yours turn green?"
joephoto,"Engaged, but not actually enabled. You have to push the light stalk forward (and turn the beam indicator to white) to actually have the auto high beams turn on (based on what the sensor behind the mirror is seeing)."
Muz,My 2020 Veloce has auto high beam.I thought it was standard but maybe it only comes with the DAP ?
manc350,hmm.. i think per Muz it comes with the DAP... damnit.. wonder if it can be added by AR dealer ?? (likely not !!)
Mash1138,"Didn't realise I had auto high beam, getting warning that windscreen is not clean enough to allow auto high beam :0"
Mash1138,"Did a teat last night, even though I get the message, I don't appear to have auto high beam. No setting in 'settings'. When I put the lights on auto, they con and the indicator goes green, push the stalk forward, and the indicator goes blue (Main Beam) not white auto main beam? Any ideas anyone?"
manc350,"I had the same message on mine last night.. FCW and Auto high beam inactive popped up as 2 separate messages each with clean windscreen blah blah blah. I do have auto headlights on my 2021 Veloce and that is a standard feaature, however as Muz says, the auto high beam only comes with DAP and the message is lazy coding / generic warnings only ..."
Mash1138,damn...what is DAP exactly? Have lane departure warning?
Valdemar Soares,"meu farol automático tem mania.many times it turns on and when another car appears in front it turns off by itself, but only one headlight turns off, the other is on maximum, so I take it with other people's light signals because the headlight is blocked and doesn't go down even if I turn off the car"
manc350,"DAP is the Driver Assistance Package - comes with quite a few bits like auto high beam, speed sign recognition, blind spot warning, some auto driving bits etc.. manual seems to have plenty of refrernces like this ""where provided"" being optional type bits...-"
Mash1138,Cheers manc350
MadMotoUK,Wow! There must be loads of drivers who need to visit Specsavers. Can't remember the last time I used high beam.
Dave Brand,Maybe some of us occasionally have the opportunity to drive after dark on twisty country roads & like to see where we're going!
MadMotoUK,"I ride/drive twisty roads in Wales all the time and I've never needed high beam. Although I do have unusually good night vision, probably making up for less than ideal daylight vision due to UV intolerance. Driving glasses for daytime use cost me a fortune haha.One thing I've noticed in recent years though with the trend towards LED, the night time light projection and visual clarity of LED is **** compared to decent quality halogen."
Muz,Did you used to work for Alfa? This could have been the Alfa rationale for the candles I had for lights on my old Alfas and still have on the GTV
jacekpr,"Multiecuscan allows to turn on auto high been effortlessly (and many more features). You just need software, good elm327 cable, blue and gray extension. Cable extensions are super important."
manc350,Hmmm... did not realise how much i used auto high beam on the Jeep.. really miss it on my Stelvio.Anyone had that enabled post sale ? is it possible to have it enabled for $$$
,
Isotope,Unless you have a car with the SGW (security gateway)? started in 2019 on most Fiat and Alfa models
jacekpr,"I'm sorry, somehow I assumed that everybody have SGW bypass. That was the first thing i bought for my car. Don't know if it's worth to buy all of this just for auto high beam, but for sure there are more modifications which you could do with it."
Isotope,How easy is it to install in a Stelvio?
jacekpr,"Everyone complains but eventually do it. You need to remove glasses compartment (with your fingers only or plastik tool). SGW is deep inside. Difficult part is to disconnect cables from SGW, so check on internet how it looks like before. I did it myself and I'm ordinary guy with big hands (which was huge disadvantage)Microsoft Word - UIM0001.docx (stuff4car.com)."

TheGrimJeeper,Have you got a weak wrist or something? Can't flick the stalk?Deactivated on my Jeep. Rubbish feature.
manc350,Haha. way too much effort... I had it on my last few cars before the Stelvio and got used to it.. but.. it has been a year since i posted that and with the little mileage I now do i barely miss it.. although i reckon blinded oncoming motorists may miss it

matty74,Yes it’s easily activated once inside MultiecuscanSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Muz,"Just how can auto high beam that works well be a rubbish feature? It’s bloody brilliant imo, not quite up to blind spot assistance brilliant but I really don’t get what there is to dislike about it, unless you get off on flicking a stalk regularly.The only negative is that it isn’t as quick at spotting the lights of a car approaching a corner as I am, when I’d probably go to dips before the other car comes around the corner, but it dips instantly once the other car appears. As most drivers are even slower at going to dip I just accept it, as I am blinded by fulls dipped late regularly.Edit, maybe they are also all on auto high beam"
TheGrimJeeper,I get dazzled all the time by Auto beamers around here. They're schiiite.
fridaysniper,"Funny one this. The wife took the dog out for a walk. Came back to the car, popped the boot open using the key and put the dog inside his little dog crate. Inadvertently left the key on top of the crate and pushed the button on the tailgate to close - not lock - the tailgate.As it clicked shut she reached for the key in her pocket and realised it is on top of the crate inside the car. No problem, right? The car shouldn't be able to lock the key inside itself.Wrong, I'm afraid. The car was now firmly locked with the key (and the dog) inside and she standing outside.Luckily I was at home and could jump in my 147 to take the spare key to her and unlock for her.So, it seems if you just pop the tailgate without unlocking the car then it is possible to lock the key inside. This was news to me. Maybe because this is the first car I have ever had with a proximity keyfob rather than an actual key in the ignition I have always been super careful to ensure I have the key on my person whenever I leave the car - I don't trust the story that the car won't lock with the key inside and I've been proven right"
,
cue2,There I was worried about the people who’re breaking into them!
chichibabin,"I have left the key in the car and boot a few times and luckily the car always refused to lock, at least not when using the exterior lock buttons on the handles. I don’t think I have ever opened the boot with the key as I have keyless entry and hands free tailgate. will do some tests and try my best to lock the key in. will let you know how I get on."
matty74,"@fridaysniper ;I’ll test that too as we often do the same. Blip the boot, put dog in crate, then close boot with close button (key in pocket). We’ve got convenience switched off so would be completely snookered if it happened to us.Thanks for bringing this to our attentionSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
matty74,"Just tested this.Yes it’s possible to lock a key inside the car using the above mentioned method.You can’t lock the key inside if passive entry is on, but then the car is more vulnerable.Oh the ironySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
manc350,Shakes head and admits same..
GVblue,""" Matty 74You can’t lock the key inside if passive entry is on, but then the car is more vulnerable.""Yet another reason to stop being a worry wuss and use the keyless function as intended. After all, what's the most inconvenient, having to drop your keys into a Faraday box rather than a bowl on the hall table or being locked out of your car in the middle of nowhere."
fridaysniper,"My key lives in a Faraday box in the hallway. Since buying the car I have never messed around with the keyless entry settings etc. Just left it as I got it. Besides, I like the fact that the car beeps to tell me it's locked and beeps to tell me it's unlocked."
GVblue,"So do you have keyless enabled or not? If it is enabled and the car still locked you out, something is wrong. If you don't have keyless enabled then you don't need a Faraday box.Does your car actually have the keyless entry function?Just to confuse matters further, my Giulia doesn't have the keyless function but it still won't let me lock the keys in the boot."
fridaysniper,I doubt I have keyless entry enabled. I have to unlock the car when I approach (hence the beeps) but that's the way I prefer it.
GVblue,"If you can see a small rectangular button in the middle of the driver's door handle, you have keyless entry. No button, no keyless."
stevemacqueen,HiMy late 2018 Stelvio Milano has the followingversionsMap version1066.10768 EUROPESoftware MV 081.999.004Are these current please ? Should I get them updated?Thanks
,
jwq,"There is a later software version, seeinfotainment softwareNew maps are published every 3 monthsup to you whether you want to update"
Isotope,just a thought can we share the files of the latest map update or is there some VIN related encryption? I'd like to be helpful but don't want to brick your Satnav!!?
stevemacqueen,"Thanks, yes I believe access depends on the VIN and has to be within the first three year warranty.I gave up trying to do it myself within the warranty period. Using my Mac I was unable to format NTFS.Tried to download on my son in law's Windows machine to achieve that and access was denied. I gave up and my dealer did it for free: nice people."
ReginaldS,"It's best to update the map. I didn't update the map before, causing me to go to the wrong place"

Alfie155,I purchased in 2019 and got the 5yr warranty deal. Would I still be able to get the free updates i wonder? I tend to use Android Auto for the live traffic/Google Maps these days. The 30% of wasted screen space for the logo is annoying though.
stevemacqueen,"I'm in the last year of a five year warranty and will check it out. I suspect it will be limited to first 3 yearsWhen I tried for a battery upgrade that was the official answer, though in the end I got a goodwill upgrade to a 95 Ah AGM."
jwq,"Standard for European maps is a 3 year period for map updates, irrespective of warrantyAfter 3 years you need to buy a new 3 year subscription, if wanted"

Isotope,"I have just got the same error today on a MY21 veloce, but one minute they work and the next they don't, did you get to the root cause??"
stelviowner,Hi there. The dealer who sorted mine blamed a dodgy connector. Had to take trim and bits of the tailgate off.
Isotope,Thats kind of what's happening to me. The error clears and then comes back usually going around corners!
Isotope,"Error has completely disappeared now, it was the day it snowed so was a bit colder than normal??"
MadMotoUK,"Sounds like a broken wire. Cold weather caused the conductor to contract inside the sheath, breaking the circuit."
Isotope,"I hope it's not that but thanks for the suggestion, the car is just coming up to 2 years old and I did all that stuff with the Giulietta rear tailgate looms about 3 years ago!!"
stelviowner,Never had all this trouble with a Ford Cortina.
Gig,Does anyone know how to remove the interior roof assist handles on 2019 stelvio?Please and thank you.I'm removing the roof rack and installing regular trim.
,
shpuncik,"you have to remove two plastic retainers on each side of handle. use something like flat screwdriver.UPDATE: forgot. when you remove plastic piece you'll have to use pliers or something similar to press on two metal tabs on each side of angle. you'll figure it out, don't rush."
cue2,it’s always worth looking on eBay to understand parts
Gig,Thank you.I got the trim clips off.I'll try pushing on the inner clips.
Imoan2,Yep ....I did that when I wanted to remove inteior trim to get my sat nav parking mode wires into the boot of my giulia.

TheGrimJeeper,Use CS gas instead of air!
alfaitalia,Trespass has not been a criminal offence in the UK for years...at best it's a civil wrongdoing. Letting air out of tyres does not constitute criminal damage in the eyes of the law either.....that's how they get away when it.
Isotope,I hope to god that beating some woke lefty to death is a valid defense when they have wilfully endangered your safety and damaged your property! We might have TPMS but as others have said I'd drive on the rims to get a family member to medical help!! And that would include getting a pet to the Vets!
Isotope,"Surely letting air out of a car tyre will result in damage to the tyre if driven on? The person who does that knows it is at the very least inconvenient, I always thought ignorance was no defence in the eyes of the law? So letting down tyres on cars and trucks or even aeroplanes is a misdemeanour?? They are jeopardizing road safety and need prosecuting end of!!"
alfaitalia,How is it damaged ? Not defending it.....but it's not damaged. How is is jeopardizing road safety?...if you can drive more than 3 feet without noticing you have a completely flat tyre...TPMS or not....perhaps you should not be driving. It's nothing more than annoying. Sure the hospital dash issue could be serious......but for a real emergency it would be ambulance anyway.

TheGrimJeeper,"""Woke lefty"" 🤭"
Isotope,"Johnny really feel for you! Hope you got it sorted, I don't have a spare wheel but do have a compressor so you just need to plug it in and rev the car up to 4000 rpm whilst you refill the tyre! Lots of unnecessary exhaust gases produced to get you back up and running!! Maybe Putin is the new climate crusader behind the tyre extinguishers?? All that extra fuel burned to blow back up our tyres will fuel his war and must make sense to some tree hugger?"
alfaitalia,My pump just plugs into the ciggie lighter.....no need to start the engine. I always have the pump and digital gauge in the boot....along with a rope type tubeless tyre repair kit (much easier than changing the wheel just for a screw through the tread.....About 3 mins to fill a tyre from empty.
Isotope,I knew this would become contentious but have you ever called an Ambulance? On the two occasions that I have we have had to transport the patients to hospital in private vehicles because they didn't come. The last instance I had was with a young lad who could have been permanently blinded at just 27 years old. We had to take him to hospital in a private car because the ambulance service did not see this as a priority. A flat tyre could have resulted in him being blind for life!!
alfaitalia,That's pretty exceptional though. Do you people not have pumps in your cars? Never been without one. Would not have helped my wife a while ago though.....some cockwomble knifed all four tyres!
Isotope,the world is full of the blood sucking fuckers at the moment!!
Isotope,OSo whilst that acid is burning out your eyeball can you just wait while we pump up the tyre because someone let our tyres down? The ambulance service don't think it's life threatening and they don't car if you end up blind! Aint Britain Great??
alfaitalia,"Really?....What are the chances of your car being the one chosen by these idiots and them letting your tyres down on the one day in 10,000 that you might need to use your car as an emergency ambulance? Those are not the sort of odds I'd be losing any sleep over......."
Isotope,"You're probably right but sometimes you also need every option available when under pressure!, I had someone's future in my hands!! BUT I can't see why anyone else has the right to mess with mine or anyone else's car when the government has approved the sale of it in this country? Surely the argument is with the legislators and not the owners?"
im.not.modifying.this.one,Welp
johnnyroper,"Whilst I understand the arguments for and against SUV’s and personally I am not a fan of them,however for some people they serve a purpose.but this thread isn’t about people’s personal opinion of big cars/SUV’s it’s about people thinking it’s ok to mess with someone else’s property.Be it a smart car or a G wagon the same applies in my opinion, the scrotes shouldn’t be messing with the tyres regardless.as implied above the decision on them being on the road and their impact lies with the governments and regulators not the owner who has spent their hard earned on whatever car they want."
Pud237,This is it. I'm sure half of it is just jealousy about what other people have. Unfortunately there is a lot of it around.
TheGrimJeeper,"Jealousy. Self-righteousness. Hypocrisy. Brass Neck.Remember this hypocritical boomer SUV driving ****? Who no longer needs an SUV, so shíts on everyone else. Probably to make up for her sad life since her kids left ...Mother, 62, deflates tyres on 100 SUVs - and wants 'army of middle-aged women' to join her protestThe member of controversial climate activist group The Tyre Extinguishers tells Sky News she feels ""exasperated"" with drivers of the ""destructive"" vehicles. She says she targets SUVs as she cycles home from work - and once deflated tyres on 16 vehicles in one evening.news.sky.comFcuk-off Anna. If your sad life is so boring, go fcuking volunteer for the Red Cross or something. You vindictive boomer.On one today. Soz."
MadMotoUK,"I'm not a fan of SUVs by any means and I'd never own one, but I can't see the logic behind this campaign. None of theseterroristsactivists seem to realise that there are much worse candidates for environmental impact.The Tyre Extinguishers are as bad as a religious cult, they're all being brainwashed by a few misinformed salesman-type-scum idiots."
Isotope,How many Tyre Extinguishers have targeted police BMW X5's X7's or Ford Kuga's and what happened to them? They probably don't target police vehicles! Can't wait for the weight related car tax when all the EV milk float owners get taxed by the new legislation! Your cars weigh so much they cause more particulate pollution via tyre wear than a diesel engine!! I read today that Poland and Italy think the move to EV's is not achievable any more by 2035!!
Pud237,"It's achievable, but the question is how much are we will to sacrifice to achieve it? The way I see it, building out EV infrastructure, renewable electricity infrastructure, upgrading the national grid, replacing ICE cars with EV or hybrids - all that is going to take a lot of energy, skilled manpower and physical resources. So in order for the living standards of normal people to remain as they are, we need to have an abundance of energy, manpower and physical resources to begin with. And we don't have any of those things in abundance. We're already a net energy importer, a net importer of physical resources and an importer of skilled manpower. So in order to pay for all this, we will have to have less of everything else. Politicians have never put it across to the public in such a way - if they did they would be voted out in a heartbeat."
WantAGTA,"If they put half of the effort they put into being irritating into actually trying to reverse climate change, the UK would be a glacier by now"
symon,"Just for arguement's sake let's say that the campaign was sucessful in getting SUV's off the road. They would then move onto other types of cars. Probably those larger than a Honda Jazz, and with more than a 1.0 engine.As anything larger isn't really needed to do 70mph or take the sprogs to school."
cue2,SUVs “off the road”?Not that likely.
alfaitalia,Nope....and many of them have better mpg than some saloon cars.....but I suppose that their argument there would be how much extra carbon and raw materials they cost to build.I'm generally a mild mannered sort of bloke......but I'm not sure of my reaction if I caught someone letting down my tyres on my planet and lung destroying diesel.....it didn't end up great (for either of us to be honest...him physically and me legally....no charges in either case though) when I caught a man stealing motorcycle parts from my shed years ago!.....but I was in my 30s then.....I might not be so lucky at 56!
Johnny Smithson,"My new Stelvio looked rather forlorn this morning with a deflated tyre and complimentary activist message on the windscreen. I was not happy. A lot of other cars were done in the neighbourhood last night, the usual SUV suspects. I don't want to get into the climate argument here, just hoping for a PM from anyone who has a link to a supplier for tamper proof valve caps (they managed to remove the one I had bought from Halfords, so they must have had the little key tool with them)."
,
TheGrimJeeper,Not yours anyway. 🤭
trecksta,"I was wondering if anyone can help me with this issue as the Alfa dealer I bought the car from tells me it's normal, and after 2 visits to a different local Alfa dealer they say suspension checked wheel bearings ok no issues found.The problem with my car which is a 2020 Stelvio Veloce 280 with 8000 miles on it is when I drive the car into long sweeping bends at between 38mph and 42mph I hear a noise which can only be described as an off beat noise similar to driving over rumble strips on a motorway but without the vibration. The dealer swapped the front tyres for the back so I know it isn't that but typically the noise is more apparent in dry conditions and it was raining when the dealer test drove it.My warranty is out in 6 months so I'm getting a bit concerned, has anyone else here experienced the same issue, and no it isn't the steering juddering at slow speeds I know that is normal.Many thanks"
,
wictod,I do get a slight noise running the Michelin Sports 4 SUV tyres when turning in to long corners at speed but not noticeable enough to be concerned.. Is it happening in both the left and right hand bends?
trecksta,"Thank you for your message both turning left and right, I should add the dealer I bought the car from didn't actually check the car as I bought it long distance, they said it's normal after checking a stock car?It only happens driving 38 to 42mph on medium long bends. Straight roads no problem at all, it sounds almost like a flat tyre without vibration or steering wheel feedback definitely from the front of the car.I don't know what it could possibly be, and to be honest it's spoiling the ownership experience for me.From the lack of response I guess it's not normal, has anyone an idea what could be making such a noise it is subtle but definitely there.Many thanks"
wictod,"It definitely doesn't sound normal (as the garage have mentioned ?), there's a lot of owners on here and someone would of mentioned it by now. I would have to say it sounds like a wheel balance, wheel bearing, possibly incorrect tyre pressure problem although balancing issue would also be evident in a straight line. If it's just a noise a not a vibration being fedback through the steering I would check the belly pan cover or whatever it's called.. had mine up on the ramp at my local specialist for a service and two of the fasteners were missing.. techie was saying most of Stelvios and I think the Giulias he see have fasteners missing, maybe not put back from previous service or they drop out... depending on what ones get missed off he's seen the belly pan cover start breaking away and flapping.. maybe an outside chance yours is doing that when cornering although it's a long shot.. and I doubt the rain would suppress this noise.. hope it gets sorted.."
trecksta,Thank you for your response I appreciate it and will book my car back in to be checked
Isotope,"I can't think of anything obvious off the top of my head, but if the noise is lower in the wet I would be thinking rubber bushes on the antiroll bar or drop links? Wet roads might, just might mean that the car is running more on the front axle than the rear, but unless something is mechanically/electronically wrong you would be really asking a lot of the car to transfer all the power to front axle on an entire journey??Only other thing, I wonder if there is a specific gearbox mode that you are in when this happens, Full auto with the paddles or in manual with the paddles/ gear knob (get ready for the jokers!!). My car has 3 times the mileage in 18 months of ownership from new and the only thing I notice is a hesitation when asking for full throttle in a bend, as you straighten the wheel full power becomes available. I wonder if you ought to get the car diagnosed on a fault code reader to see if there is anything amiss? Has the dealer/supplier not offered that as an option even if at your cost?"
Isotope,Just had a thought!! What tyres are you using? I used to be able to pick out a land rover from the strange rumble they made in the late eighties due to the off road tyres they were on. Could it be a combination of a particular tread at a particular speed?
trecksta,"Thank you for your thoughts on what the problem might be, I'm going to take the car to the dealer again and insist they take it out on a dry day"
trecksta,"That's worth considering they swapped the back ones for the front but then I guess they are still the same tyres, I'm going to try and record the noise thanks again for your input it's appreciated"
dzienj,"Yet again I'm facing an issue with my Stelvio.Out of the blue, this morning it has thrown a sequence of errors upon startup, ABS,HillHolder, ESP, Steering, Radar, Brake System. Car restart and they were gone, but all came back up and on permanently now. All very similar to a battery charging issue I faced before, but voltage and charging all healthy.I hooked it up to MES and performed the scanning:Engine- no problemsBody- U1711-2f, (Brake System Module ESC communication issues) and U1712-2f (Brake System Module DST, driving steering torque communication issues), can't clearABS- the below list, all but the Wheel Sensor clearsTVM- Can't connectWould this seem the speed sensor have given up? Would this account for such a multitude of issues the ECU's are reporting?Wonder your thoughts?"
,
cue2,How’s your battery charge level? Is their enough for the S/S to work. Modern cars get confused when the battery is low.
dzienj,"Battery is around 12.7V, 80% charge according to IBS.I had my battery charging saga a year ago, the dash and errors all looked very similarStelvo 2.2 - Died - Battery not charging at allI'll set it on conditioning overnight, see if this changes a thing."
cue2,My Stelvio went nearly flat through lack of use during lockdown with just enough power to open and close the tailgate then it wouldn’t start. Should’ve just got in and started the car but I had to call the Alfa number. A mechanic came pretty rapidly and sorted it out. No light show from the dash or repercussions.
dzienj,"Charged the battery, no change.I spend some time googling, came accros a story of a gentlemen in US who drove his stelvio into a puddle and his car developed same issue. Some sort of connector got soaked.That made me think and connect few facts, round about december i noticed my washer liquid went low shortly after filling. Didn't bother to much back then, but I also noticed shortly after, my rear window washer is not getting the liquid. Left it and thought to address when it get's warmer outside.I traced the leak!! it's in the front left corner of the enginebay, where the pipe gets into the bulkhead. There is some sort of a connection which popped. There is plenty of wiring there, especially in the lower part, all completeley soaked in washer liquidI took a heatgun, set to 80degC and trying to dry it, fingers crossed that will be it and nothing beyond."
GVblue,"Ten days ago, when my wife was driving to work ( see my ""well it finally happened"" thread) she got the Christmas tree dashboard effect.I assumed it was the battery and a recharge seems to have sorted it but it is at the dealers tomorrow to check.Strangely though, during this current dry spell, I noticed stains on the drive. They didn't look or feel like oil or water but when I looked under the car the front left suspension looked to be coated in some sort of liquid.I have left a sheet of cardboard under the car overnight to gather any evidence and will check it shortly, but cannot ignore the possibility that I might have a similar problem to yours.I will be checking the pipe in your photo which I guess maybe a connection to the headlamp washers.."
dzienj,"It turned to be the abs sensor in the end.Lifted the car up today and found the cable near the sensor split. Not sure how this might have occured, cable is not moving nor touching anything really. Judging by the cooper oxidation, it’s been a while i was driving like this and it eventually gave up. Soldered this back and heat shrink wrapped, all errors are gone, but will need to change this sensor shortly as i don’t think the cable heatshrink isolation will hold for long in these conditions."
GVblue,"I took our car into the dealers today as all three USB ports had stopped working several months ago.Dealer phoned this afternoon to say I could collect the car but that they had only managed a partial repair and fix one of the ports as a new part, on back order of course, was needed.When this working USB is selected it comes up on the infotainment screen as ""Ultra Fit"" which I guess is some sort of workaround.Anyone any idea what ""Ultra Fit"" actually is?"
,
wictod,Ultra Fit is a Sandisk brand name for one of their USB storage drives... unless they've use one of these to make it work or that's what you've got plugged into the working USB?
GVblue,"Thanks wictod, you're spot on. I just imagined they had breathed some black magic on it, never thought of something as obvious as that."
Maximus84,Went to move the Stelvio today and I noticed the outside air temp at -44C!!Threw up a code of P0071 Ambient Air Temperature Sensor Range/Performance.Reset the code but still bizarrely wrong. It hovered around that figure until I went for a drive where it started at -36C then went to -2C!The actual temp was around 7C.Anyone else had this? New sensor? Battery reset?Any shared experiences or advice welcome!Thanks.
,
johnnyroper,"Sounds like sensor is playing up, my previous 159 and Giulietta suffered similar fate. Is it still in door mirror on a stelvio that either requires new mirror or a sensor soldering in? Or have Alfa opted for a stand alone sensor on later models?"
cue2,"Still on mirrorExternal thermometer - checkThe external thermometer is a little bit slow, crazy and not precise, could you please check your ???www.stelvioforum.com"
johnnyroper,Unless it’s still under warranty then it’s going to be similar repair to the giulietta if you have the skills then.£1 10k ntc thermistor required.
Maximus84,5 years old so no longer under warranty. Is it a difficult job to fix yourself? Would rather not have to replace the wing mirror!Weirdly it showed -8C this morning (when it was actually around -2)
johnnyroper,"If you search in the giulietta section I suspect it’s very similar type of repair to that in terms of fitting the sensor. Taking mirror apart probably different though.If you want a thermistor that I know works fine pm me your address and I will post one, when I did mine I got a pack of 5 so have some spares."
shpuncik,"you can order new sensor, will have just to connect wires:Ambient Temperature Sensor Failure = Solution?Hi, I know this has been discussed int he past, but I have not found a solution to the problem, so maybe someone knows the answer or can steer me in the right direction.

Anyone got a colour code for the grey skid plate on a Monte Carlo Blue Stelvio..Regards ****head from Essex"
,
wictod,"Scouring the internet for that part and the colour code it appears the silver one I have isn't available or only comes primed but there are some new ones that possibly match the latest trim.. two versions of Black, matt and gloss Miron finish in either standard or tow bar version... Might just get the Matt Black one and get the silver colour matched and repaired ...."
DaleC1964,"My Milan is Vulcano Black and I had the skid plate colour-matched to the bodywork from new. In my opinion, is looks much better than the original satin silver."
wictod,"DaleC1964.. yeah I agree, absolutely 100% on the black car, figure I'll need the black grill as well if I go down that road.. I'll probably keep the silver bits for resale.. didn't want to start blinging up the car really but these items do make the car look better, especially from the rear.."
cue2,"The silver part always strikes me as being too narrow as a feature. I’m trying to resist getting involved in changing wheels or silver bits. As it is the Speciale suits the internal boot rails and bike attachments better than a blacked out set of window surrounds , skid plates etc."

nannini,"I replace my standard Veloce one with the new Ti version,looks a lot better"

Deman77,I was messing around my bumper with exhaust openings and the amount of pain I went through trying to reach via wheel arches was insane. If it turns out the skid plate is removable I am the biggest muppet ever.
wictod,Where did you get this skidplate... have only seen the standard shape (tow bar and non tow bar) versions at Partsworld.. Still considering swapping my scratched one out.. Defo an improvement in looks. I never did find the paint code for a respray either..

Jambo,"Hi,About a month or so ago there was an OTA download to my headunit.I watched this complete nervously as this was the first OTA download I had noticed on this car.However, since the update, the handsfree tailgate system has not worked, not matter how much i waggle my leg under the rear bumper.Now it may be completely conincidence and unrelated to the OTA update, but i wondered if anyone had noticed the same?I've looked under the bumper and can't see much there that looks like a sensor for the tailgate to open/close.Does anyone have any further detail of where i should be looking in case this is a simple connection issue? (There are no reported errors on the car)Thanks"
,
Navlet,"Just a thought. If your battery is low the electric tailgate may be disabled to conserve the battery, this used to happen on my wifes Evoque."
joephoto,Did you go into the settings and check that the hands-free lift gate function is enabled? Sometimes updates will inadvertently change a setting.
shpuncik,OTA updates are only for connect/telematic box - they don't touch anything else. as joephoto suggested check settings in infotaiment if it ain't disabled. otherwise there could be error in system and you'll have to read errors with diagnostic.
Jambo,Thanks - yes the car is plugged in on lifesupport most of the time currently (on trickle charge)
Jambo,"thanks - yes have checked the settings and it's still enabled correctly, disabled and enabled again for good measure"
Jambo,thanks - its under warranty still for another 18 months or so... i'm just trying to avoid a trip to the dealer if possible as the car tends to gain more issues or even damage each time it visits
cue2,"I can verify that the tailgate will open even if the battery is about to run out. During the lockdowns my car was sitting unused for several weeks and when I went back to it I made the mistake of using the last bit of charge to open the boot, not leaving enough to then start the engine. A helpful Alfa roadside assistance man arrived quickly and resolved it."

They are factory fitted Michelin Lattitudes, has anyone tried Pirelli Scorpion Verde's? They are about £40 a corner cheaper than the Michelins at the moment? Have any of you tried anything else that works well? I have had good experiences with Continental tyres on lesser cars but don't want to lose the handling and feel of the car with the wrong tyre choice. Please don't start bashing me for the wrong car choice having had a Giulia before!!"
,
TheGrimJeeper,"I had them on the Evoque. Good SUV tyre, but not 3PMSF rated."
Isotope,"Thanks for the prompt reply, Pirellis right? what's 3PMSF mean?"
Isotope,mud and snow something?
Isotope,Just Googled it and every day is a schoolday!! 3 peaks mud and snow flake!
TheGrimJeeper,"3PMSF (3 Peak-Mountain, Snow-Flake) means rated and legally accepted as ""winter"" use tyres.M+S (Which the Scorpion Verdes are) just mean they have a mud and snow tread pattern but haven't gone through homologation."
Isotope,"Thanks for the info, I know most people in the UK get away with Summer tyres most of the time , but it would be nice to have a durable all season tyre for the winters we have?"
TheGrimJeeper,I've used them to go skiing. They were ok. Others were chaining up. Evoque just carried on climbing. They just don't meet French rules as of November this year.
Isotope,Are you based in France then?
TheGrimJeeper,Yup.
Isotope,"We were hoping to move to the Charente but the pandemic and Brexit meant we couldn't get the move done in time, I guess you got there long before all that mularky??"
TheGrimJeeper,Indeed. It's way more difficult to get residency now. (Compared to just arriving.) But still very possible.
eastsoutheast159,"The Stelio is a great SUV, I also went from a Giulia to a Stelio. I had to replace a pair after 13000 miles and stuck with the Michelin. My Range Rover came with quite worn Michelins fitted and I just fitted 4 Scorpion Verde’s and have no regrets. From my experience with Pirelli you won’t get the same mileage out of them as you did with the Michelins. My son is an Alfa nut also and had a string of Giulias and swapped between Michelin and Pirell, he was always happier with the Pirelli."
wictod,"My 280 Specialie came fitted with the Pirelli Scorpion from new, they were on their last legs at 25k and were swapped for Michelin Pilot Sport 4 SUV which have done a further 20k with no issues. What I didn't like about the Pirellis was for the last 10k before swapping them out they felt like they weren't gripping in the wet when traversing the white lines between lanes.. I'm about due for another set myself and think I'll stick with the Michelins. Maybe I exceeded the operational effectiveness of the Pirellis + 15k mark?"
Mash1138,"My Milano done just under 17,000 miles, still got 5mm on the Michelins ..."
TheGrimJeeper,Warn AS vs new budget AS test:
pocholin,"My own personal experience with the Scorpion verde is horrible in the snow. My 2017 Volvo V90 (in the US) came with all season Scorpion Verdes, I drove twice on the snow, they had almost no traction. It was scary to the point that, for the first time in my life (in 35 years of driving), I decided to invest on snow tires. They're okay in the other three season, just nothing memorable. I'd go with the Michellins...or the Continentals, which are also great tires."
TheGrimJeeper,"The Scorpion Verde are not a 3pmsf snow rated tyre even though sold as all-season.All the new range of All-Season Pirellis, that are actually snow rated, have ""SF"" in their name. For SnowFlake.If it's only M+S then beware of this for any tyre. Especially older stock."
LandDownUnder,"Hi Isotope. I'm on my second Stelvio, and each one of them came with the Michelin Latitudes (255/45/20). On my 2018 Ti I swapped them at the end of their lives for Pilot Sport 4 SUVs and couldn't have been happier; transformed the handling and surprisingly the ride too. Now with my 2021 Veloce I've again swapped the Latitudes for Pilot Sports because I wasn't enjoying the drive on the Latitudes. The grip on the Pilot Sports is far superior, as is the handling, wet and dry, by a country mile. I'm in Australia, so I don't have to worry about all season tyres."

cue2,"Front suspension - Alfa Romeo patented structures and solutionsThe aims that have guided the suspension design phases have maximised handling and comfort performance, creating an unmistakable, unforgettable steering feeling, preventing steering wheel reactions caused by the engine torque on the Q4 versions. Achieving these objectives meant selecting a double wishbone suspension with a semi-virtual steering axis instead of a McPherson; in fact this archetype ensures more suspension angle controllability, which is needed to better take advantage of the tyre characteristics and thus ensure maximum road grip. The Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio double wishbone suspension with a semi-virtual steering axis consists of:The unique feature of the front suspension is in the fact that there are two separate lower levers, hinged to the strut differently: this double lower link (Alfa Romeo patent) performs a ""scissors"" movement that keeps the linear steering feeling in all conditions. Results like these simply cannot be achieved with a conventional suspension with a single lower linkALFATM LINK PATENTED FRONT SUSPENSIONThis solution ensures full control of the longitudinal arm on the ground depending on the suspension direction, it optimises the steering speed and precision in all types of conditions, it guarantees the typical Alfa Romeo central driving feeling, and ensures a linearity of response to the upper limits that can be used in total safety. A high definition steering feeling that has no equal.This is shared with the Giulia and is a cause of the “skipping” on slow speed manoeuvres."

Isotope,"I did the front brake pads today and I looked at a couple of videos on the net and they all seem to miss a simple thing to make the changing fairly easy. Most of the videos make the point that the pipe to the caliper is a solid pipe, so you don't want to put it under too much stress. What I noticed is that the solid pipe is terminated at a hose clipped to a bracket on the part labelled 5 in the following picture. On the bottom of the bracket the ABS sensor wire, there's not a lot of slack in this and it is held in a rubber grommet, slide this out of the bracket by pushing it down from the car. Then if you remove the two studs and 10mm nuts holding the bracket, you can manoeuvre the caliper around on the flexible hose to use piston spreader. I did try pushing by hand but one piston went in and another came out, so best to use the correct tool, and you won't spoil the caliper paint etc using g-clamps and the like. Hope that helps anyone thinking of doing it themselves?https://motori.quotidiano.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/02_Front-suspension-Alfa-Romeo-patented-structures-and-solutions-768x590.jpg"

Isotope,"I only got the pad warning last weekend and as you can see there's about 2mm left, luckily caught this before I needed new discs!! Doing some gently running in now of the new pads!!"
Isotope,First time I've worked on a caliper with pistons on both sides so no sliding pin mukarky like you get on cheaper setups. There was about 1mm difference between the wear on the inner and outer pads but nothing like I have seen in the past when the pins seize etc!!
symon,You had your monies worth from those.
Isotope,Must admit I was surprised how low they were but luckily no damage to the discs!!
Isotope,"They have done 20,000 miles so I'm pretty impressed, my previous cars with less BHP used to do about 10k at the most!!"
gogsygtv,"I got one of those double sided caliper tools for about a tenner on ebay, looks like the ratchet wont stand up to much abuse but for all the times i'll use it will do fine. I did mine last year, the rears are pretty easy as single pot / one sided.Just to add on the fronts and that metal brake line - when you pop out the grommet the pipe is still sitting inside a metal ring, it is very easy to scrape the pipe and damage the plastic coating exposing the metal to corrosion. I nicked mine slightly, so gave it a touch up with a bit of hammarite so there was no bare metal."
Isotope,"I think I probably have the same tool, it cost me £15 and like you say will probably be used twice (left and right caliper) every 2 years unless you do trackdays!"

cue2,The BMW solution is to have a big drop from the base of the screen to the bottom of the sideglass.
Muz,Whatever your point is has passed me by but that is just plain fugly
cue2,One of the reasons the Alfa feels wider is that the higher base line of the door glass means the nearest bit of road you see is further away than in the BMW.
GVblue,"So, the Stelvio is so wide he's only happy driving it on really wide roads. The steering's so sharp you need to be an F1 driver so as not to steer it through a hedge and he can't use the brakes properly. But he would change a superbly driving car for the sake of a few widgets on the infotainment system.The bloke's either talking rollocks to fill out his video or he's an idiot. I think it is probably the former."
cue2,He does seem familiar with Alfa but changes his opinion as ordinary people wouldn’t understand. But not in a patronising way…
Muz,"It’s what you’re used to I guess. The steering is pretty good but I never think “ooh this is direct” it just is what it is. The brakes lots moan about. I drive a few different cars and yes sometimes in the Stelvio when I need to brake quite hard, I have two stabs, a soft one, followed by a hard one. It has crossed my mind that the car won’t stop on occasions but a bit more pressure and it does. It’s just different not bad.I don’t agree re the engine noise either, sounds great to me in D and I have never even thought about how many revs it goes up to, it’s really well geared imo. What would be 3k in my TS GTV is hardly 1.5k in the Stelvio and I only noticed this because I keep the GTV below 3k when warming up and 3k would be flying in the Stelvio during warm up. I’m a bit anal about keeping revs down on a cold engine.I have never owned a BMW so have nothing to compare the infotainment system, tend to use it with the button and the dial so am not affected by what is quite a laggy response touching the screen. I have moved the widgets around to suit and I really like the infotainment system. Spend most of my time using Apple car play though.Anyway I quite enjoyed that review."

stevemacqueen,This review is mostly rubbish. Yes the steering is superb and so are the brakes. Ive never had a problem withmine.Theysmooth and perfectly controllable unlike my previous BMW X3 which were grabby and terrible It drove like truck and the steering was so bad I never knew where the front of the car was. The Stelvio is an absolute pleasure in comparison.The fundamental engineering is superior to the German equivalents but one has to have an engineering knowledge to appreciate it. The power to weight ratio is 170 bhp per tonne compared to the Germans at 100 BHP per tonne. The reason is the lighter weight by 100 kg. Check it out. JM is a ****.

cue2,Update me then. Are you still using twice as much energy per capita compared to us? And what would happen to the world if everybody had as much stuff as you Americans?I imagine you believe the world is flat.
stelviowner,Thing is you may not be right..I might not be right. Don't be too certain what the future holds. If it all turns out in a way you never saw coming be prepared to be amazed at how wrong you were. Ask any bookie how many people get it wrong regardess of how absolutely certain they were that they had it right. All you can be certain of is the present and in the present my fuel filler flap looks exactly lovely. I don't presume to predict and if you do you will be either wrong or lucky.
joephoto,"If we are in fact using twice as much energy per capita as you, and I have no idea whether we are or not, it is totally irrelevant because our Gross Domestic Product, in other words, how much goods and services the US produces, is at least 10 times greater than the UK. Hence, the the energy consumption needed to be a leading world power, unlike the UK, is far greater. I believe in capitalism, not socialism like the Brits, and of course I do not believe the world is flat. But I bet that you also believe that the COVID-19 virus came from a bat and not the Wuhan lab, since you apparently believe everything the media tells you."
cue2,"The U.K. GDP per capita is just over 40,000 dollars and the US is 63,000 dollars. Probably why a US parent buys their kid a car to drive to school that would be driven by a responsible adult in Europe. So out of touch."
joephoto,Your logic is completely illogical. What is the relevance of a parent buying a car for a kid so that they can be independent and drive themselves to school? And the US GDP is larger because we actually produce more. Sounds more like you are jealous of what the US is capable of that the UK is not.
cue2,The goods and services deficit as a percentage of GDP for the U.K. and the USA are 2.6% versus 3.7% respectively. This is considered a good indicator of what you seem to be trying to highlight.
joephoto,Quoting meaningless statistics is just meaningless gibberish. Are you at all capable of making any salient points without using irrelevant statistics?
cue2,"Yes but I’ve got the knowledge to work out which statistics fit your argument, You say we don’t make as much stuff as the US here in the U.K. You import even more stuff than we do as a percentage of our GDP. What don’t you understand about that? It’s certainly not meaningless."

stelviowner,Glad to hear it. This was a tounge in cheek thread to be honest. Never intended to descend into a global warming spat. I was never that convinced that humans were altogether responsible for climate change. I tended more to the cyclical nature of earth weather patterns being responsible. Over time though I have altered my views and now concur that we are probably having quite an effect on climate. Reversing the trend? Real tough ask. Our little contribution however laudable will alter nothing without the major polluters changing their approach too. I fear that may be whistling in the wind. Not certain electric cars will solve much either. They still use carbon to charge. Out lifestyles now are so energy dependant that any meaningful change will be fiercely inconvenient therefore contested. Whether we have the strength and determination to make meaningful change remains to be seen.

stelviowner,"Got an Audi last year as a hire car. Absolutely boring car to drive. Someone asked me what I thought of the car. I said buy a Ford, it will do everything an Audi will but cost shed loads less to buy and run."
Andy1671,I have also noticed that my filler flap is sitting flush .I think this is down to the recent heat and Polymer memory (yes that is a thing). On the rest of the discussion I'm a bit on the fence I think the global warming thing is a natural cycle that the planet has gone through time and time again but we as a species have accelerated it and can possibly slow it down againAs for the whole myth that the world is round .....You people need to look up the flat earth society with so many members around the globe how can you deny the facts😉
wictod,Mine is flush and was all through the Winter.. I had a theory that it settled down over a period of years but was then reminded we didn't really have a cold Winter in the South so may be I'm wrong ?.. On the debate I just like to think we had a good Summer..
Andy1671,I love summer my favourite 6 days of the year
cue2,Kew Gardens last week. It wasn’t like that when I was young and living across the road. There was green grass.
stevemacqueen,The US population is 4 to 5 times the UK not 40 times larger.
bazzbazz,"Ok, here's something to think about -Greenland is called such because Erik the Red purposely named the icy country Greenland to lure settlers to its cold shores back in the 10th century. (The guy had a seriously twisted sense of humour . . . .)However, sometime between 450,000 and 800,000 years ago, much of Greenland was especially green and covered in a boreal forest that was home to alder, spruce and pine trees, as well as insects such as butterflies and beetles.Global warming has happened many times before as part of the earths natural & gradual cycle of change. However what the problem with this current event is therateof change, and that it is caused by anything but natural events. It's man made, and as such, most likely not happening in concert with the earths natural evolution.So basically it's most likely happening at the wrong time andWAYtoo fast . . . . the earth just can't cope."
Jambo,Does anyone suffer with this warning?“Alfa connect box requires service…”I keep periodically getting it on startup.At the first year service there was a software update done and was told to monitor it. But it’s still appearing so will re-query it again. Everything works ok so am not the bothered.
,
TheGrimJeeper,Have you tried connecting it to WiFi to see if it pulls down an OTA update?
Jambo,No I haven’tprobably a dumb question. But how do you do that?(My phone is always connected)?
cue2,Do they want you to renew your subscription?
TheGrimJeeper,No. On the Jeep Forum the Stellantis rep says it justs needs an OTA update to fix it.
TheGrimJeeper,"On the latest Jeep version there is a ""Software Update"" icon on the main app screen. That has an ""Activate Updates Over WiFi"" checkbox and allows you to also select nearby WiFi networks and log on to them."
Talisker14,"Yes, see #5 above or #6 here:Connect box faultIgnore this, it will cure itself and the message will disappear."
shpuncik,at the moment on Giulia/Stelvio OTA updates are done by itself. no need to connect phone. will have to wait as sometimes it takes couple days even week to finish.latest Jeep infotainment system is completely different - it uses Uconnect 5th gen. just as Tonale.
manc350,"Mine just had this.. Seems ok, I can connect to the car via the app and status is updated with fuel / mileage / location etc. Car was fully updated in October at Alfa so will watch and see if it comes back."
TheGrimJeeper,Can you switch the heating on remotely?I can.🤭
manc350,hahaha.. no need.. it is sat in a heated garage... so kinda...
Isotope,"I've thought this week that my rear washer was frozen up so with today's warmer weather I thought it would be okay. With the car sat on the drive I tried the rear washer a couple of times and still nothing appearing on the rear screen. I went around the car to the front nearside and I noticed a large puddle of screen wash, and you can hear the pump running. Obviously the pipe has either come off of the pump or it's split? Has anyone else had this and what's the easiest way to get to it? Undertray or wheel arch liner?? Any advice, pictures or diagrams would be appreciated, thanks!"
,
wictod,"I've had the same happen a couple of times.. The offending pipe is located on the passenger side engine side of the baulkhead with access by one hand only.. It's the gap next to / to the side of the shock mount area.. Trick is to put one hand in the gap, grab both pieces together by shuffling them together then try and push them together.. it's a push fit .. When I got the car it was off, and has come off during this weather so not sure whether it's a build up of pressure when the jets are blocked and that's the weak link in the chain and it pops off... If you're struggling I'll get a photo of it..."
Isotope,"Hi,Thanks for getting back to me can you get to it without removing any parts? I couldn't believe how much washer fluid I've used this week!! If you can post a photo that would be great?"
wictod,Yeah you can get to it without taking stuff apart if this is the problem ... I'll get a photo
wictod,"Pic 1 is the general location.. Pic 2 is the pipe.... hopefully that's the one for you as it is easy to put back.. Cheersapologies, it's behind the shock mount area towards the cabin.. memory is not that good.."
Isotope,Wow did you take these pictures tonight? Thanks for getting back to me so quickly
wictod,😂 yeah .. lucky i've got a head torch..
Isotope,"I'm going to look now, what car do you have mine is a MY2021 petrol veloce?"
wictod,2018 280 Specialie petrol
Isotope,Unfortunately my leak is a lot lower down in the wheel arch but thanks for your experience and photo's they are much appreciated
wictod,Looks like left wheel and inner wing off.. unfortunately there doesn't appear to be decent diagrams online that show the circuit around the car..
Isotope,"I contacted the dealer and they don't have any appointments till after Christmas, so I went DIY. I took the wheel arch liner off and amazingly there is a joint just around the thick plastic at the top of the near side wing.The corrugated pipe has a rubber connection that had blown off of the furry part, there's a barbed hosetail like you would have on a fishtank hose pipe on that bit.You can do the job without removing the wheel, but there are two screws that are under the wheel arch trim just under my wrist in the photo. I would imagine the dealer might pull the trim off using the service manual but I broke all the clips on our 500x last year doing the front fog lamp. There's enough give in the trim to remove the screws without detaching the trim. Just make sure you remove all of the Torx screws, there are 6 in the wheel arch, a 10mm plastic nut and then 2 more torx screws under the front bumper area,, you don't have to remove any body panels. Houston the Stelvio is fixed and it took about 30 minute to fix!! Not sure if it would be warranty as they might say I didn't use Tutela windscreen wash additive? Who knows??"
Isotope,"Oh and now I've just boosted my screenwash fluid with Daemon shot and Halfords -10 C fluid, hope to god it doesn't happen again!!"
wictod,"Glad it's sorted, I think the moral of the story is ensure you've got the correct seasonal wash in... I think those hose joints are ok if the circuit is free to dispense the liquid but if they freeze up the pump pressure pops it off at the weakest point (the barbed joints).. I'm going to flush mine through and use some decent stuff until about April.. lesson learned for me.."
Isotope,The weird part is that the pipes point towards the front of the car??? and the pipes to the headlamp washers are huge!!
Isotope,I love maintaining cars in the winter on my back on the floor!! I did my 147 Alternator at Christmas with snow on the ground. Luckily today was quite mild!!
yrag930,I have a similar problem .The washer hose as come off at the tailgate on my Stevilo 2019 the screen wash runs down the tailgate and onto the floor . How do I get to the hose to reconnect it ? Do I have to take lots of body trim off of the tailgate ? Thanks for any help/ ideas
Isotope,"I'll have a look tomorrow in the daylight, I think you should only need to pull out the trim at the top of the window. You might need to get some trim tools to do this without breaking anything, I've got something similar to thisPHYLES Auto Trim Removal Tool, 14 Pieces Door Panel Removal Tools for Dash Center Console Installation and Remover : Amazon.co.uk: Automotive"
yrag930,Thanks for the reply. Look forward to hearing from you
Isotope,"Sorry I didn't get any time in the daylight today but I'll have a look tomorrow. The rear hatch trims normally have about 2 screws and then some plastic clips, last time I had something like this was on the Giulietta"
Isotope,"I've thought this week that my rear washer was frozen up so with today's warmer weather I thought it would be okay.

,
Isotope,I had a look today and my car is MYY21. There are only two parts to my rear door trim and I couldn't see any screws at all. I think you would have to pull off the lower trim first to get to the top of the door where the washer nozzle is. Sorry I can't be more helpful
yrag930,Thanks for your reply . I can’t see any screws either . It looks a bit tricky to take apart . Appreciate your help
wictod,I managed to get the inside trim removed when I was trying to get to the rear washer nozzle but gave up when I couldn't access it from inside the trim.. I couldn't work out how to remove the aero spoiler part at the top of the hatch. I think that's where all the parts are contained although the tubes for the fluid must pass through into the bodywork at some point. There was a video on youtube of someone dismantling the rear hatch.. which might give some clues.
yrag930,Thank you very much for trying . I will have a word with a local garage to see if they can help ? Thanks again
rjc147,2024 Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio Spied Hiding Minor Changes | CarscoopsThe crossover is slated to have new lighting units and a larger digital instrument clusterwww.carscoops.com
,
cue2,That’s not news. It’s just a Quadrifoglio with the new bits from the 2023 cars?
rjc147,Yes I know all about the lesser models 2023 facelifts. The above article is for the Quadrifoglio as it wasn't stated if and when the same updates would be done.
TheGrimJeeper,Tonale lightswhoop! Where's the PHEV drivetrain version ? 😝
SmOgER,"I really hope they ain't sticking Tonale digital cluster in it... Spare the QV versions, at least.Besides, if they want to play that ""technology game"", the infotainment system is horribly outdated/choppy either way. With digital cluster it's neither technologically advanced nor driver focused."
TheGrimJeeper,"They really need to add a ""classic"" or ""lite mode"" to the digital instrumentation cluster to allow drivers to select a more sombre and vintage looking set of dials."
cue2,There is a “classic style“ display but no 3D needles and shadows.
MadMotoUK,Or how about just fitting real mechanical dials? Or is that just me being too old?
TheGrimJeeper,You's old! The electronic displays are pretty cool and configurable. We just need user profiles/skins. 😉
TheGrimJeeper,"Ooh And NFTs too. How modern!Alfa Romeo introduces new interior technologies for Giulia and Stelvio modelsFor the 2023 Giulia and Stelvio models, OEM Alfa Romeo is introducing a completely new digital instrument panel to ensure drivers benefit from a connected driving experience. Featuring the company’…www.automotiveinteriorsworld.com"
cue2,
TheGrimJeeper,The possibilities are endless. 😎
SmOgER,@cue2possibilities are not endless. You are stuck with what's loaded into it. Unless they'll change the graphics for QV it's definitely less sporty. Will definitely age much worse too.
cue2,Did I say possibilities were endless?One point is that the supplementary display quality has improved in the last 14 or 15 years
cue2,And the std 2018 Stelvio cluster is the same as the Quadrifoglio but without the clover symbol.
TheGrimJeeper,I said the possibilities are endless. And they are if you know how to program (probably)Blackberry's QNX
SmOgER,Not sure what are getting at.Those clusters are not customizable. First you would have to root/jailbreak it to even gain access to be able to change anything at all. Other than that you can use manufacturer preloaded couple/several views and that's it.
Deman77,Make that two. I like the new lights but digital cluster is a step back. The hybrid one we have with mechanical dials and digital middle is perfect. Though I would prefer Porsche style mechanic tach in the middle and digital speedo on heads up display.
SmOgER,"And the thing is, I would expect to see this conventional dial design in something like Peugeot:they should have positioned temp and fuel gauges to the sides like in their analog layout and have the dial indicators resting at 6 o'clock (like it was for years with Alfas). If not then maybe something like 4 or 5 to make it more interesting. But now it's just together with that font... meh. (btw look how numbers flip going from 40 to 60)And from what I can find it's either this, minimalistic dials (blanked numbers) or no dials at all (digital reading). Looks very generic and might as well be in any other car.Cluster surround with that sporty look doesn't exactly match the graphics."
SmOgER,"Tried rotating the dials real quick to see how it would look, much better in my opinion:"
Esnyperis,"Hi there,after some driving car entered limp mode home and only error was P0985-00 - Solenoid 5. After restart car was fine until other restart. At that time car wouldn't shift to any gears. Error this time was P1DB2-00 Solenoid valves supply voltage. After some restarts car allowed to shift to gear, but only in limp mode home mode.Car has 2.2d 154kw engine with 182k km mileage. Gearbox oil change was done in this summer at 170k km. Oil was in good condition.TCU voltage shows 13.5V, when ECU reports 14.0V, I don't know is it normal for these cars. To me it's quite high difference. Maybe ground cable needs some cleaning?"
,
Ivan Borimechkov,"Hello everyoneThe error code is p065b, description says that short circuit +v or open circuit isdetected.Myquestion is where from to start looking for it.I discounted the the IBS to see if can start charging without control let's say,but nothing still under 12v and dropping.Thanks in advance"
,
bazzbazz,Faulty Alternator or connections?
Ivan Borimechkov,"That's 1st to do after Christmas,hope for bad connection witch is easy accessable."
Isotope,"Hi, I can't answer your issue but wonder what MY Stelvio you have, does MES get access to the modules but you can't reset them due to the SGW or do you not have the SGW?"
Ivan Borimechkov,"Hi I did reset it,but nothing againshowed.It19 reg,but I think it's no later than 1sh half of 2018."
StelvioCL,"Hi guys, i owner of Alfa Romeo Stelvio 2020 and many times the car dont start and system pannel is highlights on every system.This problem is random and when i try start car about 20 times the Stelvio start and then show me the check engine light. This check engine light disapper when i start car about 5 or 10 normally.Then the dealer tell me is ""the battery"" because she giv the car 12,7V but i dont think so.Any ideas ??Link:Video of Stelvio Pannel"
,
cue2,Have you had the Stelvio from when it was new? Do you know the history of the battery and has the battery been flat?from the mileage it does not look like it’s been left unused.
StelvioCL,I owner from this year from May and in the beggin Start/Stop was works some times but i always try to shutdown the system. The battery normally charge to 14v testing with a multimeter.
johnnyroper,That 12.7v figure is that resting voltage after it’s been stood for a while to dissipate surface charge?Weak batteries can and do cause all sorts of issues on modern electronically controlled cars.
matty74,"Also similar faults appear after battery disconnection.No harm in checking battery connections under boot floor to see if they’re secure.If so, remove negative quick release for a few mins, then reconnect.Then press start button 10 times (foot off brake) dials scroll up and down etc as in video.Then start car as normal (foot on brake) turn steering from lock to lock and errors should clear.You have nothing to lose by doing this, it’ll prove whether it’s the battery, a loose connection or a multitude of errors that need clearing.Out of interest, you don’t have anything plugged into the OBD port do you? Bluetooth module? As that can cause similar errorsSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Deman77,only get it at low speed on side to side wobble and from driver seat it seems like it is coming from rear left (thought it was suspension or brakes - Alfa mechanic said all in order but it could be something as trivial as loose wire hitting a panel under a lining that they may never find. So I sat in left rear passenger seat as missus drove to try and narrow down the location - shocker - it cannot be heard from there at all. Does that give anyone any clues where it might be and what should I do next to try and locate it?
,
Isotope,I get a really annoying noise when the missus doesn't put the seatbelt back properly. If the belt is twisted the buckle bangs against the side trim in a way that I would never imagine would bother me? Could it be that?
Deman77,I will try and plug in the passenger seatbelt next time.
Isotope,"I really hope that helps, like I said I can't beleive how annoying the noise is, almost like a juddering anti roll bar!!"
Deman77,Have a feeling this won’t be it as I was able to replicate it with the Alfa mechanic in the car who sat in the front passenger seat and I don’t recall it not happening when there are others in the car. Let me deliberately rule it out though. I will try all seatbelts. I did already try the child seats out as well as both sides of the luggage cover in the boot out.that it can’t be heard at all from the rear seat to me indicates it may be really close to the driver’s head. So my current most likely scenario is something loose under the roof lining (no sunroof here). I need to go as a front passenger next to see where it comes from when I’m there.
francisphillips66,Hii have taken the cover off behind the mirror on my stelvioi can see the camera and to right of this is a rectangular hole where a module would fit it has a small 3 pin connector.I have had a look on eper but cannot see what this module would do if my car had it.does anyone know what this module isthanksFrank
,
francisphillips66,this is a picture of the module
Pandra,It might be the rain sensing module for the auto wiper function.
cue2,That would be connected or the auto wipers wouldn’t work..?An extra sensor for the optional driver assistance?
Pandra,According to the op’s opening comment; it isn’t connected. I assume the photo used was found elsewhere to illustrate what he was trying to find.
jwq,maybe the optional factory (interior) alarm module ?
cue2,The alarm module is standard in the U.K.
TheGrimJeeper,Humidity/windscreen misting sensor. At least it is on the Jeeps.2011-2023 Mopar Humidity Sensor 68440808AA | Mopar Estores2011-2023 Mopar Humidity Sensor 68440808AAstore.mopar.com
Mash1138,"Thought it could be the blind spot detection, optional extra in driver aids.my bad read wrong :-( please ignore"
shpuncik,@TheGrimJeeperhas correct answer - it's anti-fog/humidity/windscreen misting sensor.
chichibabin,"Anyone had the recent recall and know what it fixes/improves?""6456 agg. sw radio""Only thing I've noticed is there are slight changes to graphics. The main difference is the main settings menu has graphics on the RHS rather than being plain back.Sent from my Pixel 7 using Tapatalk"
,
GVblue,"When I collected our Stelvio in September, after a service, I was advised that the infotainment system had been updated. My immediate response was ""Oh no, it's worked perfectly well for the last two years, I do hope you haven't opened up a can of worms"".Guess what, two weeks later, neither USB port would connect and still won't. Coincidence?"
cue2,"Mine had its 4yr service, at 16000 miles, this week. The service advisor was unable to tell me what they’d done, other than the word “done” on the MOT jobsheet. They did check battery charge level and wash the car but otherwise I’ve no idea what they did beyond some ticks on the Healthcheck. The tyre pressure warning came on as I drove to the dealers and it didn’t after the service."
Isotope,My Stelvio has had the infortainment update and the Satnav and live traffic etc seems much better/detailed. It didn't go well though because it took the dealer 3 goes to get it to update and I had to wait an extra hour before it succeeded
chichibabin,"Yes, I was surprised by how slow the update process is. For a jeep that was in front of me the update took over 4 hours!I haven't tried the maps as I use android auto Google.

Jambo,"Everytime my Stelvio is at the garage there seems to be another software update.Things appear to get progressively better - yet i still have a message appearing seemingly randomly ""Alfa Connect Box Requires a Service....""I generally use a wireless car play adapter for most the time now.Yesterday i did get an over the air update though which took about 5-10 mins to complete.1st one i've noticed - so was cautiously watching it complete."
TheGrimJeeper,It's being reported as nearer 5 hours elsewhere.Apparently there's a recall ongoing which updates ~5 separate control units. And it looks like they have no way to run these in parallel. Bonkers.
Isotope,"I was led to beleive that my car has heated windscreen washers but I've struggled over the last couple of days? Do they work with the heated rear window switch like the mirrors do? I can't see any wiring anywhere near the nozzles but there is some in the pipework on the drivers side under the bonnet? Are they the heaters because they are too far away from the passenger side imho? Any info would be appreciated, thanks."
,
cue2,The nozzles are on the wiper arms aren’t they? Is the heating near the outlet or does it warm the fluid?
Deman77,"Whatever they are they will not cover the whole path, nor the tank, which will be exposed at these temperatures. Still needs to be appropriate dilution washing fluid. Which in itself means heated nozzles are not necessary. Which begs the question - why have them?"
Isotope,"@cue2yes the nozzles are on the arms but the devices with the wiring are under the bonnet drivers side, so yes probably fluid heaters@Deman77I have to agree, so tonight tried to get some Daemon shot and there's virtually no screenwash in stock where I live at the moment, even Halfords has next to nothing left !!"
Deman77,order some rubbing alcohol or neat isopropyl (probably can get next day from Amazon) and mix it to concentration that will not freeze at -10. The upside of own made is you control the ingredients so it will not have any additive that might react with the old fluid and curdle and block the pump.
cue2,"Today, following the service, the nozzles are not delivering much fluid. Not sure if it’s the cold or inadequate mix for the temperature. Makes me wonder what they actually did at the service."
Deman77,I don’t think they top up washing fluid. Think they just check it.
cue2,"They usually do, in my experience. Sometimes they forget to add fuel or washer fluid to the loancar sometimes though.I got into my car and the steering wheel and gear selector were covered in cling film, which was odd."
jeb55,probably a fastidious mechanic not wanting to pass on some nasty disease.... or acquire!
cue2,Indeed. But had they sanitised the Panda Hybrid loancar?Probably not as it had the usual illuminated low fuel warning on.
wictod,"My washers are struggling, won't operate until the car has been driven around for an hour and fully warmed everything up, guess I've not got enough anti-freeze in the wash bottle.. using Sonax Xtreme additive (probably summer only).. once thawed, the passenger side jet is sending the stream over the wing and nowhere near the screen?"
kilsajj,Hi allHaving come from an audi s4 and using the premium petrol I now own a lovely alfa romeo stelvio veloce. 2021.It is such a wonderful thing to drive . I still have been using premium in the alfa for the last couple of months. It got me thinking now the price of petrol has rocketed I might go onto the standard petrol.Any thoughts premium or standard.Cheers for any replies.
,
alfaitalia,Wrong terminology. The basic 95 RON fuel in the UK is called Premium.....the allegedly better stuff is called Super.... you cant get the Standard grade (often just 92 RON octane) in the UK....but you can in many other places. So what you really want to know is Premium or Super....and since your car is engineered to work at it optimum on 95 RON and cant advance its timing far enough to take advantage of the higher octane Super offers (even ALFA recommend 95RON) you wont gain much if anything....you might as well save your money and use Premium ....others will now appear arguing that their car runs better or gets more MPG on Super....but will have no argument for why!!! Usually these are the same people who argue just how important is is to use the correct grade of oil rather than a better one!!! LOL! Best just to try it and see what you think....I'll move over for the others now!!!
lussoman,"Fromcarbuyer.co.uk:''Even if your car is cleared to run on the new E10 fuel, you may choose to run it on super-unleaded anyway. It should prove slightly more economical, so you’ll be able to get more miles out of a tank of fuel, and some super-unleaded fuels are said to clean and maintain the internals of your engine.The difference between unleaded and super-unleaded petrol is down to each fuel’s Research Octane Number (RON). Standard fuel is often 95 RON, while super is often between 97 and 99 RON. Super-unleaded petrol can sustain a higher pressure before burning than standard petrol, essentially allowing the engine to produce slightly more power.Super-unleaded burns a little more efficiently than standard petrol, and also helps to prevent pre-ignition in the engine. This is when the petrol doesn’t quite ignite when it should, which produces a knocking sound and can lead to engine damage if left unchecked.''People on here have been reporting poorer mpg since using E10, and some say the opposite with E5. And if you know where to shop, it's only 7p a litre more for E5 anyway.As far as oil goes Alfaitalia, anything will do as long as it's the correct grade as stipulated by the manufacturer. The same goes for petrol - no need to pay over the odds at Esso, Shell, Texaco et al when some supermarkets are selling it considerably cheaper."
amfalconer,"I run mine on E5 (which most premium fuels are now), the RON number is less of a concern for meWith the disparity in costs being less than the cigpacket calculation of efficiency vs the two, I reckon I'm still a bit better off."
TheGrimJeeper,Agree with amf. I just run the Jeep (1.3 FireFly) on the one with the least amount of E numbers.Which around these here parts is SP98E5 or SP95E5
Welshrugby,"I run my stelio quad on E10 and no issues, might try a couple of tanks of E5 esso premium soon but I am sceptical of any improvements"
cue2,It’s been a while since the last thread on this subject. The difference now is that older engines don’t like the new fuels. I’m sure other than that I’m sure it’s still a case of the tanker driver pouring a bottle of “detergent” into the more expensive fuel’s underground tank.
alfaitalia,No they are not..... more name confusion Premium petrol is the normal 95 octane stuff....all is which is E10. SUPER is the 97 and up octane E5 stuff. The normal stuff most people use is called premium and E10. Confusing I know!
lussoman,"I can honestly say I've never heard a single person refer to standard unleaded as '""premium""!It's super or the other in my world - there's only two choices where I go."
alfaitalia,"From shell...E10 usually even says Premium on the pumps....Premium Unleaded (95 RON)Despite the ‘Premium’ label, Premium Unleaded is actually the most commonly-used petrol across the UK and Europe, and is suitable for almost all petrol engines.Super Unleaded (97 / 98 /99 RON)Super Unleaded has the higher-octane rating (97/98/99 RON) that is widely available here in the UK. It is mostly used for high-performance cars that require it, and that will benefit from using it."
lussoman,"Yes, there's only two, that's my point! Most people define the word ""premium"" as being a better version of something . In this case the better version is Super.That's why no one says they're filling up with ""premium"".It sounds good from a business point of view though.Isn't the term a hangover from a bygone time when there used to be an even lower grade of unleaded available?"
amfalconer,"I used premium as a ‘catch-all’ for the higher grades, the V-Powers, Momentums et al. I actually think its an Americanism?Either way, its what I used to differentiate between the ethanol content, rather than RON."
alfaitalia,"When I were a lad the local fuel station in Funtington used to have 4 grades of fuel....2, 3, 4 and 5 star....I don't ever remember seeing diesel there.....think it was a separate area around the back...Two-star petrol had a minimum octane number of 90, three-star 94, four-star 97 and five-star petrol at least 100 octane. My dad used to run his old Fords/Consuls etc on three star....but I always remember him making a point of filling up with 4 star when we were driving a long way on holiday. He used to tell me that 5 star was just for fast cars and Rolls Royces!....here's no car man but that's not far off the truth for the time. He used to put 2 star in the lawn mower. Can't imagine many cars would have run well on 90 octane 2 star even back then......but at least it was proper fuel with no ethanol and plenty of healthy lead!"
TheGrimJeeper,"Just refer to RON and E content.Anything else is just ill-defined marketing poo-poo.Like AWD, 4WD 4X4: There is no real legal/standard definition."
sprint_veloce,"91 RON is the 'standard' petrol in NZ. Makes up about 75% of sales, remaining 25% is 95, 98, and one retailer sells 100 octane. So most cars today are perfectly happy on 91. None of my Alfas are unfortunately."
MadMotoUK,I think that will be because EU standard is 95RON so any European engines will be designed to run on 95 or above.
TheGrimJeeper,"Yep, 95 is an EUminimum."
Deman77,Esso 99 is actually E0 - no alcohol in most parts of the country (a few places where it’s E5 - website has details). I find it noticeably less sooty on chrome exhaust tips and it’s easier to clean them than shell vpower which is E5 - I used that for the first year.I assume the story on the exhaust tips is mirrored upstream so I expect there is less rubbish depositing inside the engine too. With E10 it is probably even more so.As for performance/mileage I can’t say I could tell the difference from vpower to Esso and never tried E10 on mine.
chichibabin,"I find my Stelvio Veloce 2020 runs great on Esso and Shell E10. I wanted there to be a perceivable difference in performance and mpg with E5 but never observed anything consistent. E10 is certainly cheaper per mile than E5 as if there is an increase in mpg, it definitely does not offset the cost. I found mpg quite poor with supermarket E10. I put this down to Shell/Esso being invariably above spec whereas the supermarkets just meet it.Sent from my Pixel 7 using Tapatalk"

kilsajj,Hi allHaving come from an audi s4 and using the premium petrol I now own a lovely alfa romeo stelvio veloce. 2021.It is such a wonderful thing to drive . I still have been using premium in the alfa for the last couple of months. It got me thinking now the price of petrol has rocketed I might go onto the standard petrol.Any thoughts premium or standard.Cheers for any replies.
,
lussoman,First time I've heard that. Is it common knowledge or inside information?
MadMotoUK,I didn't think it was a trade secret
lussoman,"Esso supply a third of Tesco fuel stations according to Esso themselves.I haven't looked into who supplies the majority, or who supplies Sainsbury's."
cue2,In the past it’s been suggested that the tanker delivery has a bottle of additives added for some brands of petrol station.
Muz,I have binned my long term petrol station snobbery since Putin invaded Ukraine. I had chosen Shell premium where available for years after my wife’s uncle who had been in the business in the US insisted that I only put Shell into his car I borrowed. I filled up at Asda for the first time in my life early in the year as the price was so much cheaper than shell. I am now a “cheapest petrol in the area” ***** now. Once every three fills is E5 though.When in France I still insist on Total or Shell though. Nowt queer as folk
lussoman,"Nobody gets even remotely close to what Sainsbury's charge for E5 where I am, so that's where I always go.That said, I've been using supermarket fuel for as long as I can remember without issue. When there was fuel supply issues/panic buying (last year?) I used a Shell garage for E5 and experienced rough starting straight after. Cured once I went back to Sainsbury's. That was a bizarre experience."
wictod,I have often wondered whether what I am paying for is what I am getting at the pump.. I have been using Shell V Power religiously until very recently when I started the Esso E0... There were times where I couldn't get any better than 27-28mpg and times when I was getting 32-33mpg driving a very similar route pattern... I noticed during the shortage that my local Shell only had the V Power and not the cheaper stuff.. surely a company that big and well known wouldn't rip people off?
lussoman,"Shell were possibly the most expensive in my area during the shortage, but I got so desperate for petrol I had to use them. And by the way my car behaved straight afterwards, I suspected something dodgy going on. I haven't been back since.I guess most filling stations are run as franchises, that would explain the differing prices for the same brand at different outlets in the same area."
Andy1671,"I use Costco fuel E5 in the Stelvio (and Suzuki mini twin) but only because it is cheaper than supermarkets, I pass it on my trip to and from work, I've got to get some use out of the membership feeseems as good as Shell/Esso and other higher priced offerings"
wictod,Does anyone know how get access to the rear washer jet... it's not working properly. Started pulling the upper tail gate trim from its pop rivet connectors and had peep inside but don't look to be the way in.. seems like the washer and tailgate brake light appear to another integrated unit below the spoiler but can't work out how to remove that section?

wictod,"Like clockwork, I return to this thread almost a year to the day.... I should have sorted it properly during the Summer, anyway, short of getting the nozzle replaced is there any hacks to make it squirt out as it just dribbling from the nozzle.. Basically, when I started messing with it originally the jet wasn't directing into the best place for the wiper to clear all the screen. I foolishly started poking around in the hole hoping the nozzle could be moved to a better position.. since that the jet has changed to a dripping tap effect.. I think i've opened the hole up too much.."

,
Muz,I have a MY20 Stelvio and it only connects to Apple CarPlay by the cable. Phone connects wireless but no CarPlay apps workCan’t help with the screen size as the infotainment system was updated on MY20
bobbybox,"You have the same infotainment system as me (2nd Generation).It does not support wireless carplay (Apple devices) or wireless Android Auto (Android devices) out of the box. As you say, you need to use a cable. You must then install the relevant apps on your phone via their respective app stores (App Store for Apple and Google Play Store for Android). For example if you install Waze on your phone it will then appear on the car screen as an app when you plug it in with the cable. Not all apps support your car screen, check in the description in the app store to confirm support.It is possible to add wireless support (removing the need for a cable) by using a 3rd party device you plug into one of the USB ports. Personally, I use an Apple iPhone so I purchased a CarlinKit 3.0 device that plugs into one of the USB ports under the centre armrest. Now when I enter the car, the CarlinKit recognises my phone and automatically launches Carplay. They also make a version 4.0 device that is compatible with Android phones.CarlinKit(other brands are available, this is the one I use)As a final feature, I have added a wireless charger which is cylindrical and sits in one of the cup holders. I slot the phone in and off we go.Wireless ChargerGood luckBB"

,
MultiDoc,Known issue with some Giulias and Stelvios. I had the same issue with spontaneous alarms going off and eventually the front cabin light fixture was replaced under warranty when I mentioned it during the service a few weeks back. Haven’t had any issues since.
Andy1671,Thanks for the reply I did mention it to Mangoletsi when it was serviced but seems they forgot about it .The car is still under warranty so I will give them a call and see what they have to say
MultiDoc,"Just a heads up, it took 3 weeks to get the replacement light from Italy, so better get them to order it as soon as possible."
Old Engineer,Have you thought about a spider in the unit that does volumetric scanning?
Andy1671,Seems like a plausible reason to trigger it I will keep an eye out for itOn another note my TPMS light has just pinged on it is saying OSF is at 2.1b NSF is showing 2.2b is the system that sensitive ?I don't have the manual with me at the minute does any body know how to reset the light after I check/correct the pressuresAndy
MultiDoc,It should autocorrect after you drive a bit
Andy1671,Thanks Ill see how i get on
sprint_veloce,"As said once the pressure is correct it will sort itself quickly. It's not so much that it's sensitive, just has a lower limit and warns you if you go below."

Andy1671,Its a low pressure warning

Johnny Smithson,"V excited to be collecting a Stelvio 280 Veloce in a couple of weeks from Research Alfa in Nuneaton. We are planning to do at least 2 trips to the French mountains next year, but the car is supplied with summer tyres (Michelin Latitude 3 Sport) which won't be legal over there when it's snowing, so I'm thinking about getting it fitted with winter or all-season tyres in December. If I keep the original set to swap back after Easter, I could repeat each year ad infinitum or until my knees can't ski any more. It does mean having to store one set all year round though, and I don't have a garage. Alternatively, bite the bullet, stick with all-season and sell the Latitudes as nearly new? Any advice would be appreciated, in particular your favoured tyres for this sort of caper.Cheers, Johnny"
,
TheGrimJeeper,"Yes, in France you must fit a 3PMSF rated tyre as of next year for any winter mountain road driving. Up until then you can legally get away with an M+S marked tyre. I use All Seasons 3PMSF tyres all year round. Can't be arsed faffing with switching/storing/etc. Vredestein Quatrac by choice as it's an asymmetrical XL tyre with some light off-road ability.See here:All season tyresHi all I am contemplating getting a set of all season tyres. My summer michelin tyres are fine but I would like all season tyres rather than winter tyres. Are all season tyres really good in the snow and ice. Cheers for any replies.www.alfaowner.comDash Cam footage of Renegade on Vreds:"
TheGrimJeeper,"What happens when you use summer tyres and try to fit chains in the middle of the road:These numpties, along with another, had blocked the road for 15 mins before we could get past them. Note how little snow there actually is on the road."
Johnny Smithson,I have to confess to being one of those poorly prepared drivers in the past: if you aren't well practised it can be a real nightmare fitting chains to a hire car when it's snowing and dark. Hence my decision to get a 4WD with the right tyres this season and drive to the mountains instead of flying there! Thanks for the advice.
frustin,Enough to bring the whole of england to a standstill.
TheGrimJeeper,"OK I just checked the loi in France as someone sowed doubt in my mind.So as of this year, from the 1st of November, you must be equipped for winter on mountain roads in defined regions where the new rules apply.But there will be leeway upto 31/12/22.The rule is to either have ""winter tyres"" fitted, which are defined as being clearly marked as 3PMSF and/or M&S, or to have at least 1 set of chains/socks for the driven wheels.From 1st November 2024 only tyres marked 3PMSF will be allowed."
Johnny Smithson,"Anyone using these? I've provisionally ordered a set for a Stelvio 280 which I am collecting next month. I need tyres that can cope with the Alps in winter, but won't let me down during the rest of the year in typical mild UK conditions. Thanks for your comments!"

Maplin,"I’ve just put a second full set on my Freelander (not a Stelvio I know) and they have been excellent, far better than the Continentals the car originally came with new. Got huge miles out of the first set although the car isn’t driven that hard. Excellent feel and grip in both the wet and dry, not used them much in the snow. Not cheap but well worth the money in my opinion, Black Circles or Costco can offer good deals. Obviously not used them on a Stelvio."
lozuk,"I've had the CC+ on my 159 for three years, they now need replacing. Probably done about 40K miles. When the CC came out they were in a class of one. Reassuringly summer-tyre like in the dry, surprisingly good in the snow, bit lack-lustre in the wet. The CC2s are apparently similiar to the CC+ but just a bit better across the board. The competition has caught up and bettered them in some areas, so I'm going for the Vredestein Quatrac Pro this time. If I lived somewhere actually snowy I'd get the CC2s though as they are unmatched in the snow, better than some dedicated winter tyres."

Deman77,"all that she is wearing, her bicycle, what she eats, heating and electricity, the phone she uses to be brainwashed and angered to do this - they are all contributing to destroy the planet in many cases more than that suv she hates so much. That suv is paying for the road she is riding on and the insurance that will pay for her surgery when she falls off the bike - so she might have to walk to work on a muddy path if we just kill off cars. If she analysed things well - the single biggest contribution she could make quickly to reduce the impact on the planet is to take her own life and perhaps as many other humans as she can - ideally near the compost heap that uses aerobic decomposition method - as that only produces water and no methane. I am not saying it to be mean - it is logical based on facts - humans and their consumption have impact on resources but how what hurts most is open to debate. Now we are not going to do the best but drastic thing so we have to compromise and change the complex system slowly to avoid a shock to the system we do not fully understand. How we compromise and how we approach it has to be thought through and militant rabid behaviours just make it harder to have a sensible conversation.Anyone who has not switched to basically feeding themselves off land by themselves and cutoff from any of modern conveniences then takes militant stance against some small “bad” thing that humans do is either a fool or a fraud when it comes to talking down cars use (or more narrowly - suv).

shpuncik,"no hatch on Stelvio, you can replace bulb at least on xenon from engine bay."
cue2,Slightly different relationship to the wheelarches?
francisphillips66,Hidoes anyone know if the base headlamps can be changed for the ones with the led running lights ?thanksfrank
,
shpuncik,"yes, you can retrofit xenon headlights instead of halogen ones.connectors are same but there is more to the retrofit. you'll have to add and do some changes in wiring, add AFS ECU to have full xenon headlights functionality, add height sensors on front/rear suspension, change light switch, add headlight washers.without AFS ECU headlights won't move. washers/height sensors most likely will be required to pass MOT."
cue2,They’re not cheap.

aspender,Anybody else with a MY20 Stevio (or Giulia for that matter) got a prompt on startup that the Alfa Connect box needs a dealer service? Appeared for the first time this morning.
,
Deman77,"I ignored it.I had it on mine a couple of times shortly after it did prompts to update connect box that I okayed. I ignored the return to dealer both times and moved on and not seen since.I did get car information appear on the connect app after about a day (wonder if Related) - till then I only had lights, Locks and location. Now get fuel level and other status stuff like service - though I suspect tyre pressure is not accuarate - been stuck on 2.6 though I changed to winters on Saturday and put on staggered pressure 36/39as per manual. Also it uses European units.I think they are rolling out services so it’s all a bit beta.Did you see you have to subscribe to theft service as an extra? It works - I got a message after tyre shop guys lifted my car and set off alarm."
aspender,I have fuel/pressures in the app prior to this message (there was an OTA update a couple of weeks ago)I have subscribed to the theft alerts as it was cheap enough not to think about it too much. However I've had a couple of clear false-positives from it. Including on Saturday when it alerted me shortly after I filled up. I think it is sensitive enough to trigger if the parking brake on the Quadrifoglo (separate from the rear disc caliper) doesn't engage quickly enough after turning off the ignition (I've a learnt behaviour to just let the car do it rather than explicitly putting it into Park)
Deman77,Perhaps unrelated then. Mine showed up twice on two days and not since.
Muz,"Yes, I got the same message at the end of last week. I spoke to a couple of dealers who had not heard of the error before. I thought it might be because I had changed the recently purchased cars number plate to a personalised one.I emailed Alfa Connect and got a phone call from Italy at 7.35 on Friday evening from a very pleasant lady. She advised me that Alfa Connect only works on the VIN number so it couldn’t have anything to do with the number plate change and that she would escalate it.I still had lights and lock and unlock but petrol and location were stuck on a few days before and didn’t change. By Sunday evening all was working as normal.Sounds like it might have been a system glitch if others had/have similar problems?I also pumped the tyres up to 2.4 front and 2.7 rear as they were showing as 2.3 all round. After I had done it Alfa connect showed 2.3 on one front tyre and 2.4 on the other and 2.5 on the rears. This morning they showed 2.4 and 2.7 - 24 hours after I had changed them. I was starting to doubt the garage tyre pressure machine!"
Welshrugby,"I have it on my new stelvio quad of 2 weeks, damn dealer not replying to emails so may try the assist line tonight and see what the problem is"
Deman77,Mine was also back end of last week but no messages from Saturday onwards.
Muz,"My Alfa Connect playing up again. Fuel and tyre pressure updated yesterday even though I drove the car today. Location, lock, unlock and lights work though.Bit crap that it’s so flakey"
GVblue,Can someone tell me what useful features (free ones) Alfa Connect offers?
Deman77,You’ll be waiting a long time.
Muz,"When it works....Fuel level, tyre pressures, mileage, when next service is due, an online owners manual, lock and unlock doors remotely, turn lights on remotely.Also gives you car’s current locationI have the above free until Feb 2025 on a Jan 20 registered carPayable additions - WiFi and stolen car assistance"

Deman77,"Nothing much useful at the moment.I thought remote start would be there, but no - seems not for us.Pre dec19 cars should have 10years included and afterwards it’s 5 but like you said it’s a bit pointless at the moment.the full features would include speed limit alert and geolocation boundary crossing alert which might be handy for when you leave it with valet or a let a teenager drive.I do think you need to enable it if you want to get the theft assistance service - and insurance considers that a tracker fitted car then.If you read the t&c it does store record of your driving which can be shared with the authorities on request but as long as you don’t go through speed limits I doubt it stores how you get to those speeds"
Muz,"Agreed, but as it’s a new car to me and new technology, that I haven’t had in a car before, I am still quite enthusiastic about iti’ll probably bin it in a month or so, but I am impressed with how quickly Alfa respond to me. They have already sorted the problems I have had for the last two days on the system."
aspender,"The website does say:In-Vehicle Notifications, Send & Go, POI Search, Live Weather/ Live Traffic/ Live Speedcams and Last Mile Navigation will be activated from April 2021.So there's more to come, how useful it all is will remain to be seen!"
GVblue,"Ahh! technology, if I hadn't seen your car history I would have thought you were a BMW/Audi convert. Just drive the flippin car."
GVblue,I did ask if remote start was part of the package as that was the only thing I thought would be useful but it was not and never will be I was told.
Muz,"You have no idea how much you have offended mea BMW indeed. Spawn of the DevilMy most modern car ever before the Stelvio was a 2007 159As an Apple Fan Boy I like technology, even if I am as old as the hills"
GVblue,Oh no! You worship at the Alter of Apple. I see an Audi in your future.
Muz,"Ask for a refund on your Crystal Ball. I did have an Audi A4 estate years ago as a workhorse, it rivals the Lexus IS 200 I also had for the best built but dullest car ever. I won’t be getting another, I like being let out of turnings by other drivers too"

Deman77,the connect box complaining about updates went away on its own for me.If it bothers you enough you could try disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it to see if it resets enough subsystems to get it to go away.could ask dealer to do a car software update.
blackveloce,Danke für die AntwortAber battery abklemmen bringt nichtsDie box hat eigene AkkusUnd mein Händler sagt er hat alle Updates gemacht
Deman77,Raise a case with Alfa - can do it online. This will go both to local Alfa Romeo and if can’t solve to Italy and they will get in touch. Once they figure things out they will reach out to dealer with what to do.
Muz,My experience with Alfa is very flakey. Sometimes brilliant sometimes absolute arrogant “dont give a ****”
Deman77,Germany is pretty big for them so I bet they will make an effort.
blackveloce,Das habe ich getan ( alfa Mailand weiß das seit 2 Monaten)Mein Auto war schon zweimal in der WerkstattDas Problem habe ich seit 4 Monaten
Deman77,It doesn’t get any more involved than the case with Alfa. I suggest you keep asking them for updates and what the next step is.
Isotope,"I had this pop up today on a MY21 Stelvio Veloce, it was at the dealers getting an upgrade about a month ago so a bit surprised or is it that there is another upgrade already??"
Muz,Upgrade? What upgrade? My car is three hears old in January and hasn’t had a single upgrade or update that I am aware of. I did update the maps myself just after I got the car but as I always use Waze I haven’t bothered since.

Johnny Smithson,"Much as I still love my 2010 159SW 1750 Ti, it's now got 90,000 miles on the clock and I am thinking of getting something a bit newer for long distance trips to Scotland and Europe. Would like to stay with Alfa but getting cold feet about the Tonale. Wished they had made a Giulia wagon but it looks like that went in the bin, so I'm now wondering about a Stelvio 280 petrol. There are a few 2018 models knocking about at a decent price (mid-20s £K for modest mileage). Or should I go for the upgraded 2020-onwards vehicle? Thanks for any advice. Johnny"

crimsonbadger,I’m on the same boat but with my 159 2.4 q4. However I want to add stelvio. Ideally Milano version. Thoughts on which year model to go for would be appreciated

crimsonbadger,100% agree that’s why I’m in process of retrofitting xenon lights
SanRemo78,"Hope you can get it to work - my 2.4 Q4 had them fitted from new and I was horrified by how poor the standard lights were on a 1.9 donor car I had for a month in comparison. Polishing the lenses made a small improvement. Don't forget that you will need to add headlamp washers too. The bumper might have the cut outs for them, the washers work with the windscreen wipers when the headlights are on. and they don't half empty the washer bottle fast!Guy"
crimsonbadger,Got lights ( bran new) both height sensor different lights control panel a bits of wiring. Also different washers bottle jets lines and bumper. Could use a sneak peek on wiring. We’re are you based?
Navlet,"Do it.The Stelvio is a great practical GT car. 3 weeks ago I took ours to Auxerre from Nottingham and back and this week to Dundee and back to Nottingham.The later trip was with gales rain and traditional Scottish weather. The Stelvio was faultless, planted, stable in cross winds with plenty of grunt and economical too ( 2.2 diesel) .Its fun to drive ( for an SUV) and turns heads, the lights are perfect ."
Muz,it’s fun to drive full stop! In my case it did take a while to get my confidence as I was not convinced as an SUV it could be!
MultiDoc,"I also went from a 159SW to the Stelvio. My first choice would have been a Giulia SW but as others said unfortunately never happened. It took some getting used to because of the width of the Stelvio especially in narrow backroads but very happy in every aspect. Did a 5week trip abroad this past summer with a fully loaded to the brim Stelvio and the car was faultless everywhere.Go ahead and won’t regret it I’m sure. As for facelift or not, personally I might be the odd one because I prefer the “old” ones and the niceties in the facelift models don’t really make a difference for me (wireless charging etc)."
Johnny Smithson,"Thanks for the advice and encouragement folks. I did the deed and have purchased a 280bhp Stelvio Veloce....! Now to get the Sportwagon MOT'd and spruced up, after which I will post it on the Forum first before going out to Autotrader if there aren't any takers.

GrahamStannard,My 18 Milano was stollen and quickly recovered thanks to a tracker but the damage done to the internal wiring (in a attempt to disable communications for builtin tracking) resulted in the Body Control Module to fail a few days later.It prevented the engine startinging and meant I had to manually put the gearbox in neutral and have it towed to my local Alfa guarage.Good news is it should be covered under warranty but so far has taken six weeks to get the part in from Italy and it still has to be fitted. With that kind of service how do Alfa expect to sell anything other than second fun cars that the owners can afford to have sitting around waiting for parts whenever a new part is required.Has anyone else had a similar problem?
,
MadMotoUK,"Its not just Alfa, all manufacturers are experiencing delays in parts delivery."

As you say all makes are struggling for parts, even on new cars."
fridaysniper,"Picked up a second hand Stelvio from a dealer a few weeks ago. I must confess I didn't do much other than just kicked the tires and lit the fires before I put the deposit down and bought the car. It's a 2.2 diesel and has less than 35,000 miles on the clock. I also purchased an extended warranty for another two years on it. I know it's a waste of money doing that but figured I didn't want to get stung if something goes catastrophically wrong with something on the car.Checked with the dealer when the car would be due for service again and got an airy response of ""not for another 6,000 miles"". Now, I can identify horse droppings by the smell as well as anyone else and I knew this to be a big old pile of the stuff. While it is true that the car had a service about 6,000 miles ago, that service was over 11 months ago. And if I didn't want to invalidate the extended warranty (I bet the small print has all sorts of get out clauses to prevent them having to pay out and missed service intervals would be right up there) I better make sure the car is serviced once every 12 months, or once very 12,000 miles - whichever comes first. I could have made a big deal about it and get them to do the service, BUT they are not an Alfa specialist and in any case what's to prevent them from just saying they've done it and not doing it?I decided to take it to someone I know and trust for a proper look over and service. I don't mind paying for it if I know it's going to be properly done. Anyway, service all done and the car has a clean bill of health (which is very reassuring and pleasing), however one of the fuel flap hinges is broken. Apparently this is a regular issue with these cars and is quite an expensive fix. Took video of the offending flap and sent to the dealer last Friday. They reassure me and said they'll have a look at the video and will get back to me on Monday. Of course Monday nothing happens. I chase them again today because I want to know where we stand. As far as I'm concerned they are responsible for making it right. They sold a vehicle with a known fault and I'm pretty sure I can contest it as ""not fit for purpose"" ie the fuel flap does not work the way it's supposed to. They've ""been very busy but will get back to me without fail today"". Let's see.If they say (which I hope they don't) that it's not their problem then I am afraid they are heading to the small claims court."
,
Isotope,"Sorry have I got this right from your post the ""dealer is not an Alfa specialist"" but you've managed to buy a 2 year extended warranty from them? I'd be a tad worried how that works if it's not a Mopar franchise of some sort? I know there are some good warranties available but I would want a OEM warranty over and above the supplying dealer if possible. I had a similar issue with a car from Motorpoint. You buy a car from them with 3 months manufacturer warranty left and they coerce you into paying them a premium for their warranty? Luckily I claimed in the manufacturer warranty for a job that took 2 weeks to sort, I'm not sure the Motorpoint warranty would have paid all of the costs at the time? If your warranty is worth anything you really should not have to resort to the small claims court. Anyone decent will sort a fault that occurs so soon after purchase, or at least I'd like to think thats how I'd be?Going back to your issue, I didn't think the fuel flap hinge was a common issue on Stelvios? It's definately a common issue on the Giulietta having changed one myself. If it's similar you can sort in about 15 minutes for about £3?"
matty74,The service countdown schedule is visible within the infotainment menu.9000 Miles / 365 DaysSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
cue2,The first I’ve heard of fuel flap hinge issues.
fridaysniper,"The service interval on the car showed 30 days or something left before service. All sorted now though.The guy who serviced it is very knowledgeable and I have no reason to doubt him when he says it's a common issue. Could be like the rear wiring loom on the Giuliettas - some people have issues with them and some don't. My gripe is that this was a known fault with the car and they never disclosed it to me. I'm still waiting for them to call me - I guess I'll have to chase them again tomorrow morning.I had a similar warranty on my 147 and did claim a few bits on it with no issues. I am of the opinion that this is not even a warranty issue - this is them supplying a vehicle that is ""not fit for purpose"" as per the Sales of Goods Act. I have no doubt that they will make it whole for me - it may take some convincing but I am sure they weren't trying to screw me over or anything. They just didn't see it and as we all know any car dealer's ""100 point check"" needs a large bag of salt to be taken along with it.The good news (I'm a silver lining type of guy) is that the rest of the car is tip-top mechanically so I'm pleased with that.The job on the Stelvio is apparently a bit more involved as it necessitates changing the whole thing and then getting the new fuel flap painted etc etc etc. If it was a quick easy fix I would just do it myself, but again, I have no reason to doubt my guy when he says it's a big job. It's not like he is trying to get me to give him the job so he could fleece me or anything like that."
Isotope,Sounds like you have most things covered then?I had the same engine in my Giulia and its a great choice! I think the flap can be unclipped from the hinge mechanism so you might not need to get a new one painted unless the old one needs it anyway?
cue2,"Sounds like your man knows an earner when he sees it. If there was an issue I’m sure we’d have seen it on here. What does he specialise in?And yes, the body-coloured bit is fitted to the arm so you can transfer it to a new module or repaint it. It’s the standard industry practice.Did you write “hinges”? There’s only one as far as I recall."
fridaysniper,My guy specialises in Alfa Romeos and he knows more than I do so I defer to his knowledge and experience. It's good to hear the body-coloured bit can be transferred. I don't really care how they do it as long as I don't have any issues with the thing afterward. I'm quite careful with things like that - my 147 fuel flap is not the sturdiest design and I have not broken it in 6+ years. Reason I wrote hinges is because it's just the top part that is broken. By positioning it carefully I can close the flap so it looks normal.
fridaysniper,"I have to say I like the Stelvio. It's a very different driving experience compared to my 147 but then again it's a lot more modern. The 147 feels somehow more connected to the road - inasmuch as I enjoy the driving experience (rattles and bumps etc included!), whereas the Stelvio is smooth and quiet. I did briefly consider the petrol version but I'm glad I went for the diesel. I've had nothing but good service from my 147 diesel and hope to be able to say the same about the Stelvio.Re the fuel flap - no need to have it painted if they can just swop the bits over. The paintwork is pristine on it."
Isotope,"Which 147 you got? Mine was the 8V JTD 115bhp and I loved it, it was going to be a keeper but got written off one Christmas by an uninsured driver. I loved the weighty front end (many on here villified it but the car understeered so well it was amazing) and the fact that you could switch off the traction control! So then got a Giulietta JTDM2 and it was a brilliant car, Alfa diesel engines are really good, when it got to 10 years old it was starting to cost a bit too much to keep it the way I like things. Tyres lasted longer due to no option to turn off the TCS! So chopped it in for a Giulia 2.2 Speciale and that was a really nice car, staggered runflat tyres meant it was quite costly and no amount of tracking visits seemed to increase the tyre life. I went to look at a secondhand Misano blue Giulia and saw my Stelvio in the showroom and was smitten! It is a petrol Veloce and I was at a point where I was starting to think it might be a good time to get out of diesels? Time will tell if that was the right thing to do at the time, the diesel performance and economy is quite remarkable, you can go everywhere at 100mph and still get around 35mpg!! I know what you mean by the smoothness of the Stelvio and despite being that little bit taller than a Giulia it still corners pretty well and the tyre life is also very even. I'm at 15 months old with about 15k on the tyres and still got about 4mm all round! I have never got more than 8K miles out of any tyre on any other car in my life and I don't spare the horses! As long as you are happy with your car and the ownership experience that's all that matters. Enjoy your Stelvio and if you ever want to sell the 147 give me a PM!"
cue2,Here’s a lovely annotated pic on Stelvioforum.which is the top part of the hinge?
fridaysniper,"As you look at the picture attached, the purple circled bit. The top of that bit of plastic is loose and causes the whole thing to hang loose. I'll take a pic a bit later this afternoon when I get home so you can see what I mean."
cue2,So the top part that holds the cap is separate? I still have to get the tether for my alloy cap to go into the hole in the hinge.

I know what you mean by the smoothness of the Stelvio and despite being that little bit taller than a Giulia it still corners pretty well and the tyre life is also very even. I'm at 15 months old with about 15k on the tyres and still got about 4mm all round! I have never got more than 8K miles out of any tyre on any other car in my life and I don't spare the horses! As long as you are happy with your car and the ownership experience that's all that matters. Enjoy your Stelvio and if you ever want to sell the 147 give me a PM!Click to expand...My 147 is the 1.9 JTDm 16 valve Sport Q2. Lovely, lovely little car and so much fun to drive. This one came standard with 150 bHp and I have had it mapped to around 180 or thereabouts. The first map was too aggressive and while the car was fantastic to drive (crapped all over anything that tried it on with me) the spiders and cups didn't like all the torque. I had it dialled down to about 180 bHp and it's still very nippy. I have had all the normal issues addressed (EGR and swirl flaps deleted, new Ducati Corse clutch, suspension completely refreshed etc etc. I looked at selling it but the offers I got for it was insulting to say the least. People don't seem to realise what great little cars they are."
fridaysniper,As I understand it the whole thing is apparently one unit. And it's a whole story to get it repaired. I'm still waiting for them to get back to me...starting to get a little annoyed now to be honest.
cue2,Is there any evidence of a repair which would have needed the unit to be replaced?
fridaysniper,"None that I could see. I have just tried the guy again but he's ""out of the office"" and ""will call me back""."
fridaysniper,"I couldn't see the pic you posted earlier but I do now. I think the whole thing as it is in the pic needs to be changed as one unit. You can't just repair or replace a part of it. Then, depending on how well the painted lid comes off the old one you may or may not be able to reuse it. I think that's what my guy meant."
cue2,That pic was off a quick eBay search.The arm doesn’t appear to be in two parts on mine.
fridaysniper,"Now, mine looks the same except for the fact that the whole thing just hangs down instead of flipping open and staying straight. When I close it I have to line it up by moving the whole external flap until it is in the correct position before pushing it closed. I'll try to post a pic."
fridaysniper,"Picked up a second hand Stelvio from a dealer a few weeks ago. I must confess I didn't do much other than just kicked the tires and lit the fires before I put the deposit down and bought the car. It's a 2.2 diesel and has less than 35,000 miles on the clock. I also purchased an extended warranty for another two years on it. I know it's a waste of money doing that but figured I didn't want to get stung if something goes catastrophically wrong with something on the car.Checked with the dealer when the car would be due for service again and got an airy response of ""not for another 6,000 miles"". Now, I can identify horse droppings by the smell as well as anyone else and I knew this to be a big old pile of the stuff. While it is true that the car had a service about 6,000 miles ago, that service was over 11 months ago. And if I didn't want to invalidate the extended warranty (I bet the small print has all sorts of get out clauses to prevent them having to pay out and missed service intervals would be right up there) I better make sure the car is serviced once every 12 months, or once very 12,000 miles - whichever comes first. I could have made a big deal about it and get them to do the service, BUT they are not an Alfa specialist and in any case what's to prevent them from just saying they've done it and not doing it?I decided to take it to someone I know and trust for a proper look over and service. I don't mind paying for it if I know it's going to be properly done. Anyway, service all done and the car has a clean bill of health (which is very reassuring and pleasing), however one of the fuel flap hinges is broken. Apparently this is a regular issue with these cars and is quite an expensive fix. Took video of the offending flap and sent to the dealer last Friday. They reassure me and said they'll have a look at the video and will get back to me on Monday. Of course Monday nothing happens. I chase them again today because I want to know where we stand. As far as I'm concerned they are responsible for making it right. They sold a vehicle with a known fault and I'm pretty sure I can contest it as ""not fit for purpose"" ie the fuel flap does not work the way it's supposed to. They've ""been very busy but will get back to me without fail today"". Let's see.If they say (which I hope they don't) that it's not their problem then I am afraid they are heading to the small claims court."
,
fridaysniper,
fridaysniper,You'll be able to see from the two pics above how much movement there is. The whole flap moves up and down when opened and the whole thing is loose. It's easier to show on video but I don't think I can put a video in the post.
cue2,The people who sold you the car should fix it before it damages the paint. What kind of place was it?

cue2,"If you look at this you can imagine there’s a top and bottom pivot, on the right here. It’s probably popped out when somebody got a bit rough with it."
fridaysniper,"I agree they should make it right. I don't want to name them until I have given them a fair crack at sorting it out though. I don't think it would be fair of me. It is a fairly large dealership with a few branches in London and the South- east and they seem to have mostly good reviews.If they do not make it right, or continue to stall (as it seems they are) then rest assured I shall make sure everyone and his uncle knows who they are.."
fridaysniper,"I think you're right. Looking at it on this picture, and presuming it has the same arrangement at the top, it is easy to see how it could have popped off (or broken) with some rough handling. Unfortunately even if it could be popped back in I think it would still have to be taken off the car as you can't do anything while it's in situ."
Isotope,Almost looks the same a a Giulietta mechanism the pin that connects to the spring in the picture breaks!
cue2,"Never happened to me with either of my Giuliettas. It’s pretty much a generic set-up, except with those caple systems."
fridaysniper,"Well, they have committed to fixing it. They're happy for me to bring it to them, or to take it to someone for repair. I'm fine with them doing it. If they **** it up they can just do it again. Trying to find a space in their workshop next week so it can be done then. Hopefully this will be the end of it then and I can leave a positive review about their service."
MultiDoc,You’ll definitely be able to reuse your current flap after replacing the hinge/mechanism since it only needs to slide it out and shouldn’t be damaged at all
cue2,That‘s probably why two people have already said that!
fridaysniper,I hope so. I don't feel like sitting without the car for days while they sort this out.
fridaysniper,"All finally fixed. My fault it took so long as I couldn't get the car to them before last week.Basically, a five-minute job. They took out the old broken part, replaced it with new and swopped the painted cover over from the old to the new.Ended up costing me nothing except a bit of time out of my day. Very happy with the service provided and glad I gave them the chance to make it right rather than just bash them unnecessarily (not that I would have unless they refused to step up)."
savannahsister,"Last year, we were travelling on the motorway when the oil light came on. Panic ensued as we were towing a caravan. Anyway, it turns out, when we eventually got it to Alfa, that the light comes on before a service is due (to make u sort it!) - this is what Alfa told me!!! Lo and behold, a year later, service is due so am waiting with baited breath!"
,
mikesalfa,"Generally if a light is red, it means it's bad so you should stop or take immediate action. If the light was amber/orange it's just a warning/advisory note. It should be orange in that circumstance I would think."
manc350,"My Stelvio did something similar, an orange oil light and a nagging message about change oil soon.. about 2 weeks before the car was 12 months old and had covered 7.5k miles."

,
wictod,Been tracking my 280 petrol for about 2000 miles... getting 31mpg but a lot of that is in ave speed restricted roads where i use the cruise control..
Deman77,If you have to ask then definitely a diesel.
junedo,"It's a thought going present low 50s for diesel and low 40s for petrol to possibly less than 30 for petrolstelvio.Buthave to weigh up the difference for both fuel in Stelvio and and additional cost of diesel.I did think of a Tonale, but found the performance disappointing."
Muz,"I get between 22 and 29 on a 280 petrol, maybe I have a heavier foot than others.Worried about how little love there appears to be for the Tonale"
VeloceRosso,"Every few fill ups I note the mileage, brim it and do the same next fill just so I can check mpg.Since I’ve had mine (Veloce 210 D) normally around 41mpg with mixed driving (some urban some motorway) and no, I don’t drive it particularly gently!I went for diesel for a few reasons - I’ve had diesel company cars for years and I like the torque they give you, the petrol mpg figures for the Stelvio weren’t great and the performance of the diesel in both 0-60 and top speed were negligible compared to the petrol.I don’t know about tax (VED) for the petrol but on mine it’s scary for the first few years (£470) 🥲. Hope this helps you."
alfaitalia,Even though I drive a diesel and love the torque and the mpg.....I don't think I could hand on heart recommend anyone buying a derv now unless you do more miles than the Enterprise. The tree huggers are only going to make life harder for them in the future. If you have to get one make sure it's on PCP....at least then you can get out of it in three years if is then worth £4.35!
symon,Unless you are planning on getting a big diesel such as a 6 cylinder BMW or Mercedes then you are better off with a petrol.
Deman77,a Jeep in Alfa’s clothing with uninspiring engines that Alfa took many years to tune to disguise the relation. you don’t hear anyone gushing about the best looking suv as they did with stelvio either.
junedo,"That's what I thought it would get. Spoke to someone they said well into low mid 30s, thought he was a bit unrealistic. Dealer was more honest said mid20sThe Tonale was very disappointing for performance, even in Dynamic."
cue2,What do you base this statement on?Have you driven both Petrol and Diesel engined Stelvios ?
junedo,Glad they didn't bring in the lower power version. Think it looks great.
junedo,"VeloceRosso said:Every few fill ups I note the mileage, brim it and do the same next fill just so I can check mpg.Since I’ve had mine (Veloce 210 D) normally around 41mpg with mixed driving (some urban some motorway) and no, I don’t drive it particularly gently!I went for diesel for a few reasons - I’ve had diesel company cars for years and I like the torque they give you, the petrol mpg figures for the Stelvio weren’t great and the performance of the diesel in both 0-60 and top speed were negligible compared to the petrol.I don’t know about tax (VED) for the petrol but on mine it’s scary for the first few years (£470) 🥲.

I also prefer the torque of a diesel.Everything says diesel vehicles are evil!!!Tax is expensive cost less for both cars at present."
symon,"I just think 4 cylinder diesels sound nasty, and wouldn't entertain one again personally after having driven lots of them in other cars.I would rather have a lower MPG and a more refined petrol. There isn't a massive MPG difference especially when the extra cost of diesel is taken into account."
cue2,"So you haven’t driven either? As you may recall, I’m quite opposed to the Giulietta diesel as an alternative to the Multiair, having driven both, I drove petrol and diesel versions of the Stelvio and bought a diesel. Ironically, if I was driving higher mileages I’d probably have considered the petrol but the 210 diesel in the Stelvio is a very different feel to that in the Giulietta. The balancer shaft installation is very effective and the noise inside is not bad for a 4 cyl diesel."
VeloceRosso,"Yes - everything says that yet a few years ago everyone was encouraging them!My car’s diesel, my works car’s diesel (at the moment), my wife’s car is diesel and I also have a couple of highly polluting 2 stroke Lambrettas In the garage.I suspect Greta Thunberg won’t be sending me a Christmas card!"
symon,"Has the diesel got an artificial sound generator on it, like on many modern cars?"
cue2,No. Alfa don’t go in for that stuff. The Giulietta Veloce had a resonator. By modern do you mean BMW?
symon,"BMW don't fit them to 6 cylinder petrols, but 4 cylinders and diesels get them I think. My Golf has one, but I turned it off.According to a US Alfa site that I have just looked at the Stelvios there get a sound generator but the Giulia didn't. it is a microphone which picks up from the inlet manifold, the sound is then processed and sent to the cabin.Not sure how true that is..."
cue2,A colleague rented a Clio and it had a choice of engine sounds including a GTr Nismo. It wasn’t even a sporty clio.

I agree with q it feels like the windscreen shape issue. Very steep and short windscreen. Annoys me too. I might rainX it. See if things improve."
MadMotoUK,Try degreasing your windscreen. I had a similar problem with the MiTo even after fitting new Bosch blades until I realised the PDI guy where I bought it from had used some kind of polish on the glass which had left a rather oily finish.
Navlet,"On the Giulia I had a few wiper problems when I 1st bought it. Mainly juddering and missed patches hence the new wipers blades which actually made no difference as they weren't the cause. I thoroughly cleaned the windscreen still no improvement, after reading around I decided to clay my windscreen. The amount of dirt the clay picked up was surprising, what I thought was a clean screen was covered in fallout the clay was turning brown. After a couple of passes and a thorough clean up the screen was perfectly smooth and the wiper blades worked perfectly.Just a thought."
Deman77,"When you may want to do this.When my Stelio was originally delivered you could see a gap under the front line of the bonnet from face on on the driver side but the dealer slightly improved it during first service.When I set out to do this today my driver side bonnet line was perfectly aligned with the front wing but had a slight step down to the bumper line. Terrible look if you noticed it as you can really see that step in profile where there should be an uninterrupted curve; face on and from 3/4 you also see uneven panel gaps. Passenger side was a fraction lower which was creating a minimal difference against the wing near the light (that step is almost unnoticeable because the view angles that give it away are very unnatural) but the flip side is perfect uninterrupted flow from bonnet to the bumper for a much neater and smoother look and all the gaps looking the same. I wanted to match my driver side to that.you need 13mm spanner and might need a Stanley knife.It took me 35min to figure this out through trial and error and do it so I am estimating it will take you 20min to do this first time having read the explanation.There are two things that adjust where the forward bonnet line height is on each side - the rubber bonnet stops and the brackets which are grabbed by the latches. Both the stops and the brackets are on the underside of the bonnet near the front.You turn the rubber stops and they extend/retract. You use 13mm spanner on the only nut on the brackets to adjust the height of that.They work in combo. Correct fitting sees brackets latched whilst creating max compression in the rubber stops which ensures no give in the bonnet.there is no easy way to tell if the bracket is latched from the sound or movement of the closing action. if the other side latches the bonnet will hold even through the bracket on this side is not latched. The bonnet hinges are stiff and just because the bracket slid into the latch mechanism it does not mean it has latched. Absence or presence of panel gaps is not a sure indication either. I will explain later how you can verify it.first, take pictures of your rubber stop and the thread extending beyond the latch bracket nut on the side you will be adjusting so you can return them to the original position if you get into a mess and want to revert.you need 13mm spanner and might need a Stanley knife.you will be opening and closing the bonnet a lot - probably 10-15 times. You unlatch the bonnet with a lever next to the driver’s outside knee under the steering wheel. You release the bonnet by lifting it somewhat and reaching with you fingers under the unlatched bonnet in the middle and twisting a lever in the horizontal plane. You are then able to lift the bonnet. It holds on its hinges. To close, you lower the bonnet to near closed position - about an inch to spare. You then place your hands plans down on top near the front and give it a firm shove just enough to latch it but not so hard that you dent your bonnet.Now how to tell if you are latching. Note where the bonnet front line is relative to some reference point - say bumper line. Open the bonnet and extend the rubber bonnet stop by twisting it a fraction of a turn anti-clockwise (like 5min turn on the imaginary clock face) and shut the bonnet - if the bonnet front line ends up slightly higher than before, you are potentially not latched. Repeat - if bonnet front line is higher still you are even more likely not latched. You can do it again to be certain. Start shortening the rubber stop now a fraction of a turn at a time to confirm and find the latch point. The line will be dropping a little with each little turn - at some point your next minimal shortening of the rubber stop will see a big 2mm drop in height. This is latched bonnet position with max compression of the bonnet stop. The bonnet stop has around 2mm of compression give so when it latches it will simply not rebound from compressed position. Every time you close the bonnet it compresses this much and if the latch bracket was extended just enough it will latch and stay compressed. If you are making turns that are too large you may miss this latch point or you may end up with the configuration that is a little lose and putting load on your hinges.You want to be in this just latched max compression position with your bonnet front line just a mil or so below where you need it to end up. You will then just loosen the latch bracket with 13mm spanner to slowly increase the height to your desired point.to lower your max compressed latched position you need to loosen the latch bracket and extend the rubber bonnet stop then start looking for that latched max compression position as per above - it will now be with bonnet front line lower than before. Note I had to cut 2mm off the end of my rubber stop as fully retracted I could not get it low enough (that’s probably why the dealer left it where it was). Make sure you can find that latch point and you can see it cannot be brought low enough before you go cutting the bonnet stop. It is a shared fca item and it has a fair bit of give if you cut unnecessarily but if you do not understand what you are doing you might just cut when there is no need to.To raise the front line do the reverse but if it is just a couple of mil you may get there by just loosening the latch bracket without extending the stop. Ideally you want to have as much tension as possible in the stop when latched so 1mil below the desired line is ideal."

duemila,Thanks for posting and happy I don't have a Stelvio yet
speedisym,I am going away for 6 weeks and want to keep the battery in top shape for when I come back. I don't have a garage so I cant use a cord- powered trickle charger so I am exploring the possibility of a solar panel one. Has anyone used on for the Stelvio ?
,
wictod,"Personally I haven't used one but have thought about how to negate a potential drain down parked at an airport for two weeks.. from what I've read they do work quite well, more so for keeping the battery topped up but are not that effective at replacing a mains powered charger for recharging a discharged battery due to the length of time it takes via solar power.."
Deman77,"It won’t make it worse.If you battery is healthy and cycles well I would not worry about anything like 4-5 weeks from what I have seen as discharge rates on mine after 2-3 week idle tests.6 weeks I would start thinking just in case solutions and yours makes sense. The discharge rates are so low that if that thing works at all and there is no danger of contributing to draining the battery should it fail it would give me enough comfort. I would test it with battery monitor for a few days to see it definitely puts something in especially if it does not connect to the battery directly but tries things like lighter socket - not sure that stays active. If it’s socket based and no time to test I would chop the end off and extend the wire so it reaches into the boot to connect to the battery. Obviously, keep on the dashboard as tint in the back might render it useless.the one thing I would do extra is get it topped up with trickle charger the day before you leave to give it best chance."
Pandra,If you have the athermic windscreen it probably won't work well on the dashboard either...

I've bought a trickle charger and topped it up took about 1 day only to get to 100%. Used a 12V, 10AMP 7 stage one. Looks like I will top it up again just before leaving it and then give the solar panel a go. Good tip in keeping it in the front windscreennot the back as it is tinted there"
Deman77,If you don’t have a bt battery monitor put one in and then you can check if your solar is actually effective before you leave.I agree with@Pandra- laminated glass might be a problem.A few day test with and without should show you if solar top up is effective.
Pandra,"Not sure if you meant to say “laminated” there, Deman77.The windscreen fitted to Milano models (and maybe QV’s and later models, I don’t know) is ‘athermic’. Stops UV penetration. If the op has a Speciale then it’s not a problem. I’m not up to speed on the newer models and which screens were fitted."
Deman77,"Whatever they do is a lamination layer. I thought it was IR they tried to catch for temperature control - glass is pretty good at catching UV as it is. Regardless, op should test if it works."
alfaitalia,"Modern solar panels are not UV dependant....in fact they can only actually ""see"" a tiny portion or the UV spectrum.....mostly they charge with visible light....so the athermic screen should not matter."
Pandra,Okay...😂
Deman77,"You made me look it up now. Thought I’d learn something new. Alas it’s lamination and IR rather than UV. Wasted 2min.Athermic Windshield - Glass.comAlso called metalized windshields, athermic windshields have a very thin reflective coating that acts as a screen or filter to deflect most of the solar (infrared) rays of the sun while allowing visible light to pass through the glass.

Pandra,You’ve wasted a lot more than two minutes.Sometimes less is more. Give it a rest.
KoojarraStud,Hi I am in Australia and have a couple of Alfas. I use a solar trickle charger on my vehicles which keeps the batteries up to scratch. You do not need a lot of sun for them to do their job. Just mount the small solar panel on vacuum buds on say the roof or bonnet and leave it attached to the battery. These chargers are available at most auto accessory shops. ColinB
Johnny Smithson,"I'm about to buy a new Stelvio 280 which will probably spend a couple of weeks in an airport car park next spring. From what I've read so far, the battery shouldn't drain down in that time so I won't need a trickle charger (or have I got that wrong?). My 159 Sportwagon by contrast has been a real liability: at least three jump starts this year after leaving it for only a week, and the battery isn't even very old!"
Muz,"I always disconnect the battery on my 159 if I leave it for more than a few days. As it has a clip on one of the terminals it’s a one minute job. Lock the car with the bonnet open, disconnect the battery, use the key in the fob to open the car when you get back.No idea if the Stelvio is the same as I’ve never left it in a car park for more than a few hours. My battery monitor tells me that it loses charge very quickly though, I’d be more than a little worried to leave it for two weeks unused."
stelviowner,"I recently spend a month in Scotland and left my Stelvio Milano 280 on the drive at home with no support whatsoever. I am afraid to disconnect the battery because the boot release is electric so how do you open the back to reconnect the battery. I guess you could climb over the seat backs into the load bay however... ANYWAY. When I got home I tried to start the Stelvio. Totally dead. No response to the key fob at all. I slid the back off the fob and removed the physical emergency key and used it to open the drivers door. Immediately the alarm sounded. No life on the dashboard everything remained dead, except of course for the racket from the alarm. I removed the insert from the cubby beneath the centre arm rest and placed the fob on the marked space on the base under there. I pressed the start button and to my absolute amazement the car fired up instantly. The battery light stayed on for about 15 miles of driving then went out and the car has been fine ever since. The battery is fairly new, although the car is now five years old I had a seemingly perfect battery replaced on a service because the car is so gadgety I wanted to avoid a battery failure due to age. Incidentally, I have in the past removed and replaced the negative battery terminal to reboot the car to clear silly faults. The car seems fine with this so if you really could be bothered you might try removing a battery terminal whilst you are away to preserve the battery, just be certain about the access to refit it."
GVblue,"A few weeks ago our Stelvio (280 bhp petrol, 12000 miles ,two years old) developed a ticking/subdued diesel sound on start up. This noise disappeared after a couple of miles. Today it did not disappear after an eight mile journey so I can't ignore it any longer.Am I looking at an injector issue or a multi air problem, or neither?"

Muz,Anyone on here got one or ordered one?61k seems excessive for a 2 litre SUV but it does sound like it would be a nice place to be with the tweeks to the interior. Does the adaptive suspension and limited slip diff make much difference to the driving feel?Another 1k for the Driver Assistance packageThe four year service plan at £449 is an absolute bargain though.The affinity scheme drops the price to 53k which is a pretty good discount.Should I be tempted??

cue2,My experience was very similar at the first MOT but I asked Thames to look at the rear brakes when the car was in for the emissions recall. Six months after the mot and my purchase of new pads and discs they said they were not in need of replacement.
GVblue,"My usual cynical view that rear brakes are a money spinner for the dealer seems even more probable now that all their costs will be going through the roof, at a level not factored into the price we all paid for our service plans.I wonder what percentage of Stelvios and Giulias have needed rear discs and pads changing at less than 20,000 miles?"
shpuncik,brake discs have minimal thickness.
cue2,The issue is with the scoring/pitting rather than wearing away?
RBaron,Same here. 4th service a few weeks ago gave a red flag for the Giulia rear pads with 3 and 4mm left and the discs were corroded too. Oh dear! How sad! I know how I drive my car and it is not up/down a mountain pass each day and that set will easily last into next year.
lizard,Scoring/pitting is a known issue on rear discs. I usually recommend using ATE rear discs with their ceramic brake pads.

stuartm2007,"Not ordered yet, but likely to do so shortly, and I too want a smaller plate plinth after reading the Guilia thread.

IainUK,Did you get any further info from Alfa on this? I'm trying to order one for my car.Edit: MacGeek has kindly confirmed that 50535783 is the correct part number for the Italian market front plinth. For future reference he has also advised that the part number for the smaller Italian plinth for the upcoming Stelvio Quadrifoglio is 50552824 in case any potential buyers of that version also want to fit a smaller front plate.
banjocult,"I have got further with this. My dealer got hold of the Italian plinth and will fit it on my car when it is delivered. The plinth has a 5mm curved edge all the way round, so here are two sets of measurements - the overall and the flat 'internal' area.375mm x 130mm365mm x 120mm"

IainUK,My dealer called me unexpectedly yesterday to say they had finally received the Italian mounting plinth so I dropped round and had them fit it. If any other owner needs the short mounting plinth contact EB Spares as they have one in stock and are extremely helpful.
Elfred,If you have a '1' in your number you can run a smaller plate. I just cut the right hand side part of the original plinth off and attached the one mounting point that was on the cut off piece a bit further across.You can get the smaller plate (406 x 114mm) without any hassle from herehttp://www.platesforcars.co.uk/index.html
banjocult,Well I got it sorted in the end. Italian front plinth with short plate on front and regular sized with Euro flash on back. Pressed metal plates too.

In researching them I was aware of the potential drop out problem, so I did ensure the adhesive strips bridge those areas. Lets see if it becomes a problem...they were only £20, so not a huge loss if they do."
ianrm,"I have ordered a Milano from Glyn Hopkin in St Albans and when I signed on the dotted line I mentioned not drilling the bumper for the number plate plinth and said I would supply an Italian sized plinth and velcro. He said don't bother, have a look at Static Plates. I will be going down that route after having a look. He will fit whatever I want.:happy:"
IainUK,The front bumper does not require drilling. There are already little square holes in the flat black plastic section at the the top of the left hand side grille. The fixing screws for the plinth come with corresponding square fittings that simply press into these holes. Here is my Italian market short front plinth.
banjocult,"I got mine from St Albans. They got hold of and fitted the Italian plinth for me. Reading your post I looked at Static Plates, but it does say they aren't legal and just for show. I ended up getting 360mm wide pressed metal plates but I was talking to a company called 4Dot in Borehamwood that do short acrylic plates. Their website has good size chart that shows you the legal sizes you can get with different letter/number combinations. To get mine down to 360mm I got a 6 digit Irish plate with two 1s in the number. If you want to spend more on 5 digits or less then you'll be fine."
ianrm,I already have a 6 digit registration to transfer onto the car.I have had a 3/4 size plate on one of my other cars for 14 years with no problems so will probably take a gamble on the Static plate.

cue2,The sensors work all the time. Going through traffic calming posts is pretty stressful round where we live!My issue with the plate plinth is the attitude seems to be off the vertical. Is the fascia surface below the plinth angled?
fangio63,"Heres mine, yes It's not horizontal - but follows the line if the bodywork slightly... Whilst I'm a bit OCD it looks right to me, and if I positioned the plate horizontally then I'm introducing another angle into the whole picture - and that would trigger my OCD !Look at the position of the parking sensor (below, left of the plate) .. I think the plate should be clear of that - but it might just be picking up the bottom left hand edge... I could of course move the plate further to the right.. But I like it where it is - and that then means the fascia behind it falls away as it rolls round the edge..Whadya think ?"

W1NST,"Hi Everyone,Looks like there is a strong chance I could be buying a 1 year old Stelvio Speciale. I have a 5 digit plate ?1 ??? format.Bearing in mind there is already a standard uk plinth on the front, will there be visible screw holes if I went for the smaller front plinth please?"
IainUK,There shouldn't be as the plinth for the Stelvio has fixings that go into the black plastic moulding insert in the bumper as opposed to the painted section. From memory these little square fixing points are used for both the short and full length plinths so you shouldn't see any holes if you switch to the shorter plinth.
cue2,"I much prefer the location and attitude of the Italian plate, on the bodycolour area. The U.K. plate is too low and points at the ground."
W1NST,
W1NST,"Hi Iain, really like the look of your smaller plate plinth. Have just put a deposit on a Stelvio subject to my CRV being written off which looks likely. My private plate is 5 digits with a 1 in *1 *** format. What size number plate did you order for the smaller plinth please and where from?"
IainUK,I ordered my plates fromhttps://www.platesforcars.co.uk/designer.php#numberplatesThe size for the front plate is 355mm x 111mm. The Italian front plinth does not sit on the painted area shown in cue2's photo above (that looks to be a plate that has just been stuck on). The plinth doesn't make the plate point at the ground either. It is made so that the plate sits almost flat and vertical to the front of the car. It is probably the angle of the photo that makes it look more tilted than it actually is. This photo may show that better.
W1NST,Thanks for that - if everything goes to plan will order from there.

W1NST,My Stelvio got through it’s first MOT last September by the way with no mention of number plate so would appear not to be a problem.
Pandra,"I had a short (six character) plate made up by Proplates. Configured in the 'custom plates' builder, but you are still able to pick all of the legal requirements/spacing etc. Came with the correct BS markings and manufacturers address as required for U.K MOT (whether they bother checking it or not)."
MDUK99,did you have this plate mounted on euro plinth ?
MDUK99,did you end up ordering a plate for the dimensions for the flat area ?
Pandra,"I just cut down the U.K mount. That way I could get the exact length I wanted etc.Bit fiddly, so maybe not for everyone, but worked for me."

Kirbybirdie,"Hi, The DNA control has just stopped working (not light up and cannot select drive modes) in my Quadrifoglio? Tried ringing the service dept of the dealer it came from but they’ve left for the day.. any ideas what’s wrong?Car still drives ok but guess just stuck in N mode."
,
Tjalle,"Normally I would have recommended a Norwegian reset - disconnect the battery, but with the sensitive systems, I do not recommend even that."
jwq,"Is the motormanagement fault indicator on ? In case of an error, the system will default to ""N"" failsafe mode.....In that case, sometimes starting 4 or 5 times will reset the error light."
Kirbybirdie,The engine management light is not on and the car appears to drive fine in all other ways. Have started it and drove it a number of times since it first stopped working and it’s not reset so I’ve now booked it in with the dealer to be looked at along with another couple of niggles.
SirRagnar,"Hi KirbyBirdie,Did it get resolved? If so, do you know what the issue was?I have the same issue with my Stelvio. DNA selector not lighting up and doesn't work. Otherwise no issues."
epsonix,"if this is Giulia/Stelvio with new type of DNA selector (monostable), then note they are all the time powered (even car is shut down), I know that people had issues with some DNA selectors of that type (maybe earlier firmwares), and enough should be to disconnect battery for a few seconds to restart firmware. OF course better longterm could be to go to dealer and ask to replace it (if DNA hang is the reason - hopefully newer types are free of issue).Of course in any case of various car issues, DNA may stop working (Even after battery disconnection it is required to start a car a few times)."
SirRagnar,I have never dared to disconnect the battery to to a restart of the system. Can that be done without too much disturbance to the systems and other lamps starting to blink?
epsonix,"you didn't answered kind of question I embedded in first paragraph - do you have DNA with monostable DNA knob (so the one which returns to mid position on spring, does not have permanently painted DNAR letters, production say >mid 2018)?disconnecting battery is not any issue - in my Giulia its been disconnected hundreds of times (car is used for development of accessories, and often to try retrofits or learn on how to disassebly some things, do photo documentaiton etc). you only disconnect negative terminal (it has lock button), after connecting it back start engine (there will be ton of warnings displayed, DNA in N mode forced etc), rotate steering wheel max left, max right, centre, let engine running for say 1 minute (engine operation may not be smooth, no worries - it sets its parameters), stop engine, then a few more times turn ignition on/off for couple of seconds, all will be good, no more warnings on IPC.note that all CAN modules are permanently powered, they only go to kind of low activity when you turn ignition off/close car. Imagine MS Windows without reboot for months or your phone - they will work slowly, cause issues etc. I wouldl say it is healthy to reboot your car every a few weeks, to get clean start - nowadays all is software, and (my experience), software nowadays is totally overcomplicated (and full of bugs - companies use 3rd party libraries for everything and complication level causes that full testing is very hard to do) and put into nearly all units (even mirror adjust knobs or windows up/down button sets)."
SirRagnar,"I did not quite understand the question, that's why I didn't reply. Now with those details I can answer. It is monostable DNA knob that returns to the middle. The letters are not painted, but illuminated (usually at least, mine are currently not illuminated). It is a 2019 model I have, although build in Dec 2018.Thanks!"
epsonix,"shorterm you can disconnect battery, but at least record with your phone the issue and send to dealer link to video. if that repeats visit dealer, ask if they have updates for your car(maybe there is firmware update for DSCM module - which is that new DNA knob (CAN knob, older type of knobs (not compatible) were electro-mechanical analog signal simple device fully hassle free). I know a few cases in Poland, dealers replaced knobs, and as far nobody of these guys complained for re-occurence. up to you, depends if you want that sorted out quickly but not necessarily long term, or maybe prefer now wait for dealer to see issue and replace knob (hoping that it is better and issue won't reoccur)."
SirRagnar,"Thanks. Sounds like the long term fix is the better and since it is not critical, I can wait until he has time in the garage. Everything else is working without issues and it's running in N, which I use most the time anyways."
SirRagnar,So was at the mechanic. He used an hour without being able to fix the knob. He has now ordered a new knob instead which I can get installed next week. Hopefully will take care of it.
Kirbybirdie,"Update: the DNA selector was replaced by the dealership back in February 2019. Car has been fine since. Have driven it a few times each week during UK lockdown, but the car was dead on Sunday so had to call breakdown. Jump-pack started it and left it running for approx 90mins then took it for a spin. DNA selector not working again and by today (Next morning) the the battery was dead again. It’s back at the dealership this afternoon. They’ve said they're had another Q4 in with similar issues; dead battery/faulty DNA selector."
SirRagnar,"Thanks for the update, Kirbybirdie, and sorry to hear you still have issues. I will have my DNA selector replaced next week. Hope I don't get into battery issues after that. Did you have battery issues prior to having the DNA selector replaced the first time?"
GVblue,"Yet another thread involving difficult to resolve electrical issues. If these issues become known to the motoring press it won't make any difference how well the cars drive, this is all they will focus on."
Kirbybirdie,Have had no other issues with the battery or car (other than I seem to have a knack of picking up punctures).that said though the car is fantastic and a joy to drive.

Fuse was not blown or damaged in any way.Fuse 21 also supports USB, power sockets and AUX, so I suspect usage of USB chargers (tablets, phones etc) and that the USB charges tend to work their way out of the socket in the luggage compartment on a long drive (causing wobbly connection) which maybe in turn causes the i-Drive / DNA circuitry to hang?Anyhoo, pulled fuse 21 and we're good.Happy days."

smarty156,"Toying with the idea of an almost new Stelvio Quadrifoglio but I would need a tow bar to make it worth while having.I've searched and as far as I can see (in the UK) you can't get an after market tow bar for the Quadrifoglio version.Anyone managed to find one and if not, can you get a tow bar fitted from the factory from new?Shame as Witter do a detachable flange faced toe bar for the Stelvio which would be perfect, just not for the Quadrifoglio."
,
punkatron1,"It wasn’t a factory option when I ordered mine. They do exist, just not in the uk from what I can find.I’m seriously considering importing one of these:https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2182/3043/files/Alfa_Romeo_Stelvio_Quad_Tow_2018-Present.pdf?3789Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
smarty156,"I've done a bit more Googling and it looks like it has no towing limit, which means it's not homolgated. That means no tow bar will be legal, even if you imported one.Looks like the Stelvio Quadrifoglio is off the list unfortunately."
punkatron1,Back to plan B of buying a cheap towing car then!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
smarty156,On the MY20 Stelvio Quadrifoglio UK configurator under the accessories option there's the ability to specify a detachable towbar. This could just be generic for Stelvio rather than specific to the Quadrifoglio but maybe a glimmer of hope?I'm pretty sure it wasn't listed when I configured a MY19 Quadrifoglio.
Deman77,"That is a good sign. I was going to ask about this. However, after it went online first it was listing 19in wheels as standard. Having said that, it was fixed by the time i was ordering a couple of weeks later but the tow bar did not get removed. So still some hope."
Deman77,Reached out to customer services. The answer is no tow bar for my20 Qf. I then rephrased the question - is there a Non zero towing limit for my20 and a different person called me and said no. I don’t think they lose enough Qf orders from this issue to justify the application for homologation.Until we see the chassis plate with a zero limit on it there is a glimmer of hope. But I think they would have publicised it if they went to the effort of arranging this not to put off those for whom it’s a dealbreaker.
MultiDoc,"Sorry for resurrecting an old thread but in the last issue of Alfa Romeo Driver magazine I saw this:I always wanted to put a tow bar on my Stelvio QV but since it’s theoretically not approved I dropped the idea a long time ago. After seeing this photo however, I’m wandering again if we can install one? Any more fresh news or anyone in the UK having fitted one to shed some light please?I’m not planning on actually towing anything but it would be used for a bike carrier.Or maybe anyone knows the car/owner in the pic above and can share some contact info maybe ? 🤔"
Deman77,His name is Chris Mann. Says so on the photo. Try them on linked in or Facebook. Can’t be that many.on more serious note I’d be keen for the same reason.
W1NST,I always thought you couldn’t fit a tow bar to a Stelvio QV. I have been towing my 1600kg caravan with a Stelvio 2.2 Diesel 210 bhp for the last 3 years and it has been excellent. If you only need to tow occasionally would the 280 bhp petrol not suffice as that must still be a hoot to drive if my 210 bop diesel is anything to go by?
MultiDoc,"I haven’t been able to find any contact info on Mr Christopher Mann unfortunately. He appears to be in his 70s and with a quite a long history with Alfa etc. it’s definitely doable to fit a tow bar on the QV, even the oem one fits fine. The issue Id like to clear is how you do this in the uk while not braking the law or finding yourself in trouble with insurance/mot etc.The hunt continues I guess. I’d be grateful if anyone with a Stelvio QV that has a tow bar to please post."
alfaitalia,Look at the weight plate on the Stelvio.....if the gross vehicle weight is the same as the gross train weight or the gross train weight part is blank (like on my wifes old SLK) then you cant legally fit a bar whether you can find one or not. Post a pic of the weight plate if you med help.
MultiDoc,"I don’t know why after al this time it never occurred to me to check the actual plate on the car 😵‍💫 So you’re (unfortunately correct), as you can see below there’s no train weight (it’s the same as the gross weight) 😢 The pic below is from my car"
stelviowner,"I just tripped over a report from What Car on the internet which reports on the SUV's which fare worst in the depreciation stakes. There were a few nominees which did not surprise me but I was genuinely amazed to find the Stelvio Turbo 200 Sprint leading the pack in its race to the bottom After three years this Stelvio was reported to retain 37.7% of its original purchase price.It is nice to drive a car which is not overly common on the roads, I certainly spot one when I see it, however I am not sure what causes the rapid fall in resale value.The car is more than averagely pretty to look at. My example, apart from a few sillies, has been reliable over its to date 30000 miles. Buying the car in the first place I realised that I was buying from a sort of niche manufacturer rather from a mass market ten a penny bulk supplier. But why the world in general, whilst appearing to appreciate an Alfa as a car of note, refuses to stump up the cash for one I don't understand. Alfa seems to be having the same old problem of establishing market share in spite of having a product today which is up there with the mainstream in terms of reliability and slightly ahead in performance.Road test reports seem to like them, although competitors always seem to have softer leather or an extra litre of boot space but this has failed in helping Alfa to translate into units sold.I am glad my choice of car is not a ten a penny choice, if that makes me a snob, well you have me. I sympathise with Alfa in their efforts to survive in a market which has, and seemingly still does, judge them harshly in spite of them offering a thoroughly decent product. I, speaking totally for myself, am a fan, I deplore the depreciation problems but provided the car remains as it is let the price crash, I love it and all them other beige buyers out there don't know what they're missing."

Navlet,"Can't comment on the Stelvio re sale values directly.But I can say that our 2008 Spider is worth slightly more now than when I bought 6 years ago.When I took the Giulia back to the dealer I bought the car from the year before for a service, the sales guy said he would buy it off me for almost the same price I paid for the year before !In general used car prices have gone up, but What Car and other lazy car journo's often seem to find a way to disuade people from an Alfa as a purchase. Could it have anything to do with the massive amount of advertising the German brands put their way ?FWIW the biggest depreciation on a car I ever experienced was a Merc SLK 200 Kompresor, but that was indeed a pile of crap."
lussoman,"A three-year old car only worth just over a third of what it was new? Nonsense. I can't think of a single car that would apply to, or even close.Maybe WC have been asleep for the last 12 months."
cue2,"Not long ago the Stelvio was acclaimed for being the fastest turnover on the used forecourts of the U.K.Depreciation for me is £1.40 per mile but WBAC are constantly trying to buy it since I checked for a value, just out of interest. Perhaps the cars shift because they are priced to sell? I like mine so I’m happy with that. Only problem is we probably got a higher quote from a builder once he saw how much depreciation I can afford."
lussoman,"So this is what it says:Model2.0 Turbo 200 Sprint. Auto |List price£48,775 |36k/3yr resale value£18,400|Price drop£30,375|Retained value37.7%The Alfa Romeo Stelvio isn't the most expensive model on our list, and nor are you left with the least amount of money after three years, but in terms of the overall percentage of its value lost, it takes the title as the SUV with the worst depreciation. This version features a 197bhp 2.0-litre petrol engine under its bonnet, while entry-level Sprint time gets you 19in alloy wheels, cruise control and automatic lights and wipers, among other goodies.So this car can now be had for £18k??All the cars I've been looking at - up to 3 years old - aren't far off their original list price."
Muz,"It’s lazy biased rubbish.Find me a single petrol Stelvio of any age that is below 20k, most are quite a bit more. The model is now around 5 years old and I can’t find one close to the figure they are suggesting it’s value is after 3 years.As I said rubbish is being presented as fact"

It used to be reckoned that a 10 year old car with average miles would be worth about 10% of it's new price, but except for a few really undesireable models that is no longer the case either."

This not to be confused with the electric motor knock when vehicle is offAs this feeling of clicking is also while engine runs.I put my hand on Tierod, inner one and also observed outer. Outer had no play on the wheel, but the click was there.Can it be also tires out of balance? is the Tire balance speed changing when the tires are bigger?"
manc350,Tyres would be balanced at same temperature if fitted together at the same pressures so can't imagine that would be it. i will get my wife to mess with the steering on mine later when she is back while cold then after we have been out when hot .. will let yo know if I get any knocks or noises.

,
MultiDoc,The dealer only can do it. Deregister the previous owner and set you up as current owner
Mathew Rudd,Hi ladies and gents can anyone shed any light on what you can connect to this socket in theboot.Whatadaptor do I need to fit in there to use normal ukplugs.sorryuseless at electrical stuff.i want to be able to plug in my airbed for camping ideally.
,
TheGrimJeeper,It's a standard two-pin Euro AC mains socket. The inverter that powers them isn't up to powering much more than laptop bricks or portable peltier 240V fridge/coolers.
MultiDoc,Just get a euro 2 pin to uk converter plug.
TheGrimJeeper,Those are actually quite difficult to source due to the lack of earth on the 2pin.Might be better of swapping the existing 3 pin on the lead for a two-pin and adding something like this for normal mains use:Amazon.co.uk
SmOgER,
Isotope,On my car its a very small 2 pin reccessed connector so the adaptor in the prvious post won't fit.
TheGrimJeeper,"You need something with this plug:OP, what kind of power supply is you airbed pump using? (DC? Voltage? Amps? Jack plug?)Might be easier to source a power supply from Europe:"
SmOgER,"Come on now, there are plenty of those things on ebay whichever type you want. Sourcing specific power supply would be both more expensive and would also mean you still can't plug there anything else.I assume it needs this kind of adapter then?US/EU To EU/UK/AU/US Plug Travel Wall AC Power Charger Adapter Cable Converter | eBayFind many great new & used options and get the best deals for US/EU To EU/UK/AU/US Plug Travel Wall AC Power Charger Adapter Cable Converter at the best online prices at eBay! Free shipping for many products!www.ebay.com"
TheGrimJeeper,"Nope. None of those will convert a UK 3 pin to EU 2 pin.As a Brit who has to deal with this issue all the time, the options are to swap the actual plug, the whole cable or the power supply itself for a Euro 2-pin one and then get a Euro 2-pin to UK 3-pin adaptor if you want to use it on the mains in the UK.I actually have most of my kit with US plugs. And then add a US to EU or US to UK adaptor depending on where I'm going.It is a bizarre state of affairs."
SmOgER,Very interesting. So is it the case that the UK 3rd (ground) pin has nowhere to go not allowing the other 2 pins to go in?Have you tried then using say 2 adapters I linked above plugged into one another making plenty of room (in theory) for the ground pin to rest unused?
TheGrimJeeper,"Those type of 2 pin adaptors only accept US flat pins or EU round pins. I've never seen them for UK square pins. The UK pin shape and spacing doesn't allow it.Believe me, I have every type of adaptor you can imagine:🤭"
SmOgER,"This kind of sucks then. It looks they came either in EU (like OP) or US versions like this:Personally I would have still tried to make something out of it, like maybe EU->US->UK, but it's kind of hard to argue with the amount of failed adapters you've got there."
cue2,Does this replace the 12v socket on the loadcover support on my Stelvio?
Alfie155,I believe it is a factory fit option specified when ordering your new car. I was told I could have the 12v socket as standard or pay extra (quite a bit extra) for the higher output jobbie. I couldn't see the point as I don't have any peripherals that would benefit from having it. I can still use my cooler box using the 12v socket.
cue2,I don’t remember being offered that when I ordered mine.Just looked at the pricelist and it said “230V/50hz auxiliary power outlet in boot. £85”

andypower,Hi. I think I have seen similar threads but just wanted to confirm that there are 3 years free roadside assistance with a 21 plate Stelvio in Europe ? Was about to buy AA assistance before I checked !
,
matty74,"That was my understanding, here’s a screenshot from the myalfa connect app linked to our 21 plate.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
MultiDoc,"Yes, I just returned from a 5 week trip in south europe and before we left i confirmed with Alfa customer services that the road assistance is in place."
bobbybox,"A word of warning. In the UK this service is provided by Allianz on Alfa Romeos behalf.We had reason to use their services (a post for another day) whilst in France recently. The contact centre (the first set of people you speak to on the freephone number) were great (once you work out it routes you to the local call centre to your location and you have to press a number of buttons to get put through to the UK contact centre), it was when the incident was passed to Allianz or ""the international team"" as they like to describe themselves that it all went to hell in a hand cart. Tow truck finally arrived many hours later after lots of chasing (past closing time for them to tow it to a garage), Allianz had not instructed where to to take it anyway.Much phoning the following days to get any form of update as to where on earth my car had got to let alone what was wrong with it. (I did rack up a nice £60 phone bill, the freephone is not free from mobiles that are roaming out of their home country). When it finally got to a local garage (Allianz couldn't tell me where it went initially, I had to google local dealers and suggest names to jog their memory) they were great, even went as far as phoning me directly and between my poor french and their fantastic english it was clear it wasn't going to be fixed in time for our 750mile journey home.Back to Allianz to arrange repatriation of the family and vehicle. They sent me electronic paperwork to complete (even from a smart phone its not that easy to edit a word doc whilst on holiday) and requested the V5 etc. This was emailed back to them. Two things then happened (or didn't). Allianz sat on the vehicle repatriation form for a week before doing anything (we were home in the UK before they even processed it) and then failed to arrange any flights or transport despite assuring me that their travel agent would do so. In the end I could see that flights from the nearest airport were disappearing rapidly and purchased the last 4 seats for a flight myself, along with train travel, taxis and overnight accommodation which I am now in the process of trying to reclaim the expense, oh, and those extra phone calls? that part of the expense was rejected!The final gotcha is unless your breakdown happens in the UK, the assistance service and the warranty are not coordinated. In the UK you are recovered to an Alfa franchise and they diagnose the problem and if covered take care of the warranty claim admin (despite both services being operated by you guessed it Allianz). In Europe you may be recovered to a dealer, then you have to pay for any repairs and claim back, maybe if they agree (a common practice, but annoying none the less).I am sure this is not unique to Alfa (I'm pretty sure a number of manufacturers outsource the service in this way) and others may have found the service to be first class, just not for us when we really needed it. An incident that took 5 days to resolve, Allianz probably returned no more that two calls and completely failed to deliver the key feature of the assistance service.BB"

cue2,DM me if you’re interested. Miron Gloss. It’s on eBay.
,
Isotope,"Hi Cue, just wondered what you swapped it for?"
cue2,I had the Veloce Ti part fitted at the last service in December and decided to paint the original in case somebody wanted a change from the standard part’s silver finish. No market for a std one anyway.
cue2,
Isotope,Much better than the silver standard imho!!
cue2,That pic doesn’t show the diffuser details. You’ve got to have at least 20” wheels for it to look right but I think std part in Miron is a good alternative to silver
steeley,"Hi, I'm interested if you can direct message me please ? I don't seem able to DM due to not posting much recently !"

Drew Hager,So I installed a Pioneer AVH-3500NEX head unit to replace the Alpine last fall. The biggest pain is the plugging it in and unplugging it to get CarPlay when I want it. Bluetooth was pretty good and more convenient. .....until today.Saw a review a few weeks ago for a device called Carlinkit 3.0. Costs about $99 but is just a dongle and plugs into the USB. And connects to the iPhone via Bluetooth. Just installed it and works just as described. Wireless CarPlay in my 4C. No affiliation - just purchased it and took a risk after reading the reviews.Just thought others may like to know about this option. Love the Pioneer as it’s great when I need a screen for navigation but stows away to give the simplistic vibe of the car when I want that so win-win. This is just a cherry on top. Hope it’s useful for others.

joephoto,"I just bought one of the for my Stelvio with factory CarPlay, and am actually dropping it of at UPS today to return to Amazon since it does not work. It initially connects to CarPlay, but immediately disconnects within seconds, and starts going through constant reconnect/disconnect cycles, making it totally useless."
Drew Hager,"This may be a compatibility problem. I bought my adapter fromcarlinkitcarplay.com. When I encounter connection problems, I contact their after-sales service.

Milko Gummels,"My stelvio is showing fault code p13000 , what does that mean? has anyone ever had that problem?check engine light is flashing, odometer is flashing, and the stop and go function is not working.please can someone help me."
,
Andy Bowden,"First thing to check is whether the battery is well charged that can cause all sorts of errors. STOP/START won't work if battery charge is low.If it's a diesel, P1300 may be "" Igniter Circuit Malfunction No. 1 "", but it is a manufacturer specific code.Odometer flashing generally signifies that there's a problem which needs a proxy alignment to fix. A trip to the dealer is likely to be needed if it's anything more than a low battery, unless you have use of MultiECUScan."
Milko Gummels,"I have checked the battery and the charging system, no problems. There is no dealer in my country, so a trip to the dealer is not possible"
Andy Bowden,Is it a diesel?
Milko Gummels,No gasoline
Andy Bowden,"Is the error code P13000 or P1300? If the latter, the attached bulletin might be relevant. Though taking the action it recommends without the assistance of a dealer won't be easy.The flashing odometer is often indicative that a change has been made to the car, eg a new unit fitted, and that a proxy alignment is needed. Have you modified or repaired the car in anyway recently?Getting hold of MultiECUscan would allow you to do a proxy alignment, but not an ECU software update."
Yannick Ng,"Hello, i know it is an old threat, but i was wondering, did you manage to repair this issue? I tuned my giulia this year. And now i have an engine light since 4 months already (P130000). The mechanic at the dealer keeps telling me that recallibrating the flywheel can damage my ECU completely and thus will have to buy a new one."
manc350,Hmmmmm....1500 miles and 1 month 2 weeks in and today i started getting an annying rattle / creak form behind dashboard... had a 1 hour drive and started getting quite p155ed off at the noise. Seems to be top back centre of dashboard..Anyone had this and rsolved it ?
,
cue2,No . But then only 11000 miles.
manc350,I only got 1500 miles ....
Deman77,Sure it’s not the instrument panel? That is very common - comes from cup holder lid or smth around there and some have fixed it with silicon spray. I haven’t tried. It usually only happens when it’s cold and it is unusual for it to be both cold and dry. When it’s wet the road noise from the b pillar drowns it out.
manc350,"Cheers Deman77, I will have a prod and mess, hard to work out where it originates while driving alone but will deploy ""wingman"" over the next few days and while he drives i can poke about... Rattles are my pet hate, i had none at all in the G, it was well screwed together.. the Jeep had a noisy tensioner spring in the load cover, easy fix, and a creaking seat rail which was a fault with the rail itself and quite bad so was replaced under warranty ..."
rjc147,Also check the rear view mirrorThis came from the Giulia section
Muz,Is the rattle rattle the car and the scream the OP’s reaction?
cue2,Could be. Diagnosis is difficult from the description.
manc350,"Oh yes... th scream is me !!! i hate rattles on new cars.. that said, not ruiningthe enjpyment of the car at all.. !!!drove it this morning.. no rattle so looks like a gamne of cat n mouse"
cue2,Noises can be reflected off the screen etc so they’re difficult to pin down.
cuttlefish,"When I took delivery of my Stelvio there was a very noticeable high-pitched rattle from the top of the dash, especially noticeable when in Dynamic mode 3k revs and above. Quite annoying as it was literally fresh from delivery. Got booked straight in for inspection and it turned out to be the windscreen air vent trim above the central speaker that either wasn't secured properly or was faulty. It got replaced regardless and all good. Worth checking."
chichibabin,"I have this problem too. Really annoying and started happening after a few thousand miles. Under hard acceleration a god awful rattle/buzz comes from the centre speaker area. Pretty sure it is that area because giving it a prod temporally cures it. Will get dealer to look into this when I get it serviced next, along with the screen wash dribbling out the rear dispenser when operating the front 🙁"
Andy1671,Hi allHaving a quick look in my engine bay today I spotted this pink crudIt looks like a coolant leak to me . The offending pipe goes to the top of the expansion bottleI don't see any leakage on the rest of the radiatorhas anybody seen this on their cars ? is it a big problem ?it is a 20l petrol 280bhp in a 2018 Milano spec carthanks in advanceAndy
,
wictod,"I've had a leak from the top of the radiator before, replaced under warranty but what I'd do is clean it up and see exactly where it's leaking from.. as described it's the expansion over flow back into the radiator.. getting to the point.. if it's the hose that's leaking should be easy to fix it without too much trouble.. new hose... tighten it up etc... but if it's the main body of the radiator housing then could be a problem... looks like it aint a problem if you're not topping it up all the time but would want to understand exactly where it's leaking from...

Per1,"Does anyone know how accurate it is for 0-60mph times, 0-100mph, quarter mile times etc?I ask because I'm running Costco's 97Ron petrol and see on my 0-60 timer that I've hit 60 in 3seconds and in 3.1 seconds - the numbers can't be cheated or doctored so was wondering how accurate it is. In the timer mode, foot on brake the screen says 'ready' and then starts timing when you floor it. Or am I totally mis reading the thing??Book time says 62 (100kph) in 3.8 sec. I've seen a USA review quote 3.4sec. Some how I've recorded 3.0 and 3.1 so am wondering if the timer is purely a gimmick and not accurate or if it is accurate (of course if it relys on the speedo reading 60 and it is not itself accurate then the 3 second one isn't to a true 60mph. I have a scan gauge on my Focus RS and note that needle reading 60mph is usually 57-58mph on the scan gauge connected via OBD port. If the Alfa speedo is similarly a little off then true 0-60 must be not far off 3.2-3.4 seconds!"
,
Deman77,Seems wrong to me. 0.1-0.2s better vs the declared 3.6 could be possible. Half a second at already supercar levels of performance we are talking 200-300bhp extra power requirement.i’d agree smth is wrong with measurements.
pocholin,"Mine is way off on the opposite side, when I was at the race track (a few weeks ago) I ran a 12.1 quarter mile by the track's slip time, the onboard computer showed 12.6! My 0-60 in that run was 3.8, which also tells me that even that number was off. I've also read on other US forums that the onboard computer is not accurate, someone reported a 0-100 MPH in the 5.9 seconds, which is also not achievable!"
Per1,"That's what I thought, It's a shame, but likely only an estimate. Will have to find a quiet road and properly test it out."
Per1,"Indeed - if this really was a 3 second car, it's not 505hp, more like 600+."
Mathew Rudd,I believe its a gimmic 🤣🤣

Vario44,Hi Everyone! Long term Alfa owner (still have a 156 GTA tucked away) and would appreciate any wisdom you have on the Stelvio (used).My heart says get the 280 petrol but I've settled on the Diesel due to the economy savings. probably going to go for the Speciale trim or a super with a load of extras on it. Hoping to get mid 30's on fuel economy with it for motorway driving.The plan.Will be mapped by AHM. If you have any other recommended tweaks whilst I'm there let me knowSuspension.Alfa seems to offer: 1) Alfa Dynamic Suspension and 2) Alfa SDC Suspension. Are any of these worth it? I can't find any info anywhere on what difference they make?Limited slip differential.I have a Q2 my GTA and it made an insane amount of difference. Is it worth getting it on the Stelvio and can it be fitted retrospectively?Hazard lights.Probably going to get the software update that stops them flashing. How hard do you have to actually be driving this for this to kick in?Sound.I've heard all of the sound options are a bit naff. Has anyone found a decent aftermarket upgrade they would recommend?Anything else I should look out for?I'll keep digging around on here/the interweb for more snippets but I've found it's always good to ask real people as you tend to get much better answers.Thanks everyone!
,
wictod,"Expect some more detailed technical responses from some of the regulars on here, but for what it's worth I've got the 280 Speciale 2018 and just got 35.4 mpg from an Essex to Chesterfield round trip using the high grade 99Ron stuff. I had a Q2 fitted on my GTV and know what you mean about the difference but then again that's when I was looning around the place and going through tyres as regular as the service interval.. I've never had the hazard lights come on without me activating them to say thanks to other drivers and have given the Stelvio some stick on occasions.. I didn't even know they would come if you were driving hard? I'm happy with the stock suspension unlike the GTV I had where I braced myself every time I saw a pot hole, but I'm a different driver nowadays... I just want everything to work, be reliable and get me from A to B in some style and comfort. Good Luck, they're a great car regardless of what options you go for."
cue2,It doesn’t need mapping.
Vario44,"""I've got the 280 Speciale 2018 and just got 35.4 mpg"" Arrghh don't say that it's making me want the 280 again! I've heard 26mpg is the norm for them.Interested to hear your thoughts cue2 have you tested both with and without? Every car I've owned has been mapped and it totally transformed my 159 2.4JTDM when i had it done (more MPG and much smoother acceleration).I sense the Stelvio diesel is at a pretty sporty level of map/tune as standard given the small increase that a map would offer. Does it give a boost in bhp only and no real change to smoothness/mpg?"
cue2,I’ve owned a Stelvio 210 hp diesel for three and a half years and it’s very smooth to drive and the 0-60 figure is pretty close to a 156 GTA.Torque of 470Nm at 1750rpm versus 300 Mn at 4800rpm for the GTA speaks volumes and it’s also through an 8 speed auto with the DNA selector.I just think back to a thing on TV where Celtic tuning people had a Maserati Ghibli and got its top speed measured at 200 mph. The thing was on a rolling road without any air drag so that was hardly surprising!Oh and I get over 33mpg and do quite a bit more Urban than I used to. My Giulietta MA when used the same would get a bit less.Drive a Stelvio before wasting money on remapping and having to tell the insurance company.

I noticed it start to improve as the car got run in a bit so reset it at 3000 and for the last 3300 miles the 26.3 round town and 35 motorway are correct.I love diesels an miss that slug of torque.. but.. my last one was a 2016 Jeep GC overland 3.0 diesel and it gave me a gut wrenching 20 round town and 28 on motorways... so not sure what Diesel Stelvio's are like round town but I reckon@cue2should be good for stats ."
cue2,"Yep. It’s a little bit better than a 1.4 MA if you do a reasonable proportion of urban driving. I wouldn’t feel right with a diesel in a Giulietta or Giulia but seated where you’re a bit “above“ the engine means a diesel feels ok to me. Ironically I’d feel guilty if I was still doing 15,000 miles a year but covering that in 3.5 years seems less morally (eco) bad."
Deman77,"Get the petrol, you can find those with lsd, stick a nice exhaust upgrade and it will be like QV just lighter. I think the ones that come with lsd also have adaptive suspension. You can research creating a race mode too - I think@epsonixdeveloped a solution.Te me fun other than the nice noise is being able to steer with throttle. With diesel the rev band is too narrow to be able to do that properly. Petrol will give you that to some extent but ideally stretch to QV.whenever you need to save fuel just use best fuel saving practices - anticipation. Count the mileage difference over the life and see if it is worth to pay for the fun you can have. If someone gave you a mclaren you would not be thinking hey this thing is a bit thirsty. This is not quite so extreme but you are dealing with the same dilemma."
Vario44,"Thanks for all your advice guys, much appreciated.I went with the Diesel in the end and picked it up today. The petrol one is noticeably more fun to drive/lively but I'm still very happy with the diesel, it's a shame they don't have more spirited diesel matching the power output of something like an SQ5 though. It was reading 32MPG on the way back but I'll see if that improves a bit with Vpower fuel.Haven't noticed the hazards flashing yet under harsh/normal breaking so I probably won't need to get that turned off. Also the indicators almost never seem to turn off on their own.... Is this a common thing?Getting it mapped by AHM next month so will post on here for some feedback to see what difference it has made. They also do a remote start upgrade as well which will be handy in the winter.Deman. I do like your plan but when I was looking I was struggling to find any with a LSD. The race mode thing is also offered by AHM and I definitely would have got that if I'd gone for the petrol one. This is technically the family motor so I'm trying to be reasonably sensible with it so won't need a new exhaust.... this diesel does sound particularly naff though"

TheGrimJeeper,Take it here. Should be able to squeeze through the access restriction ...Salty Jeep ImagesOut on the salt pans today...www.alfaowner.com
Vario44,"Hi everyone,Just got the map done by AHM motorsport and would thoroughly recommend.....it feels like a rocket ship now!It is noticeably much quicker to 60 and still pulls nicely in every gear. I was worried that it wouldn't be that noticeable given that the power has only increased by about 30-40bhp but it now pulls like a train. The 210 version of the diesel is to quite a hi-tune so thats why the bhp couldn't be much greater with this engine.The thing that really makes the difference is that it now has an instant throttle response which is very, very noticeable- especially in the 0-40 range. At the top end (if you were on a track of course) it still pulls much harder up to 100 but it will never compete with an Audi diesel equivalent (SQ5 etc) and you can still feel it running out of puff at the top end.MPG has also increased by quite a bit. From Dover to Reading pre-remap I was getting 44.5MPG (V Power diesel driving as fast as road conditions would safely allow). Post-remap on the way back in similar conditions it averaged out at 48.9mpg so the map will pay for itself in time. As a comparison over 800 miles of mixed (but mainly urban) driving it usually puts out 34.5 mpg on a mix of Vpower and normal shell diesel.Spoke to the guys at AHM and they're not fitting aftermarket LSD's to the diesel models at the moment (likely ever). They've heard of an option to put in race mode but for some reason it stops the paddles working so I won't be going for that.They also programmed a key so I can do a remote engine start ... very neat and great to get the car cool in summer or warm in the winterThoroughly recommend having it done it really does transform the car and as always I'd go with AHM as they really know their stuff."
wictod,Glad it's working out for you... my days of after market mods are well over but really good feeling when changes have a positive impact ... Is the V Power Diesel more expensive than the Petrol variant.. impressive mpg
Vario44,Yep Vpower diesel costs a fortune but make a huge difference on mpg. Need to do a new calculation on cost/mpg increase to see if it's worth it again as I haven't since fuel prices went crazy.I never noticed much of an improvement with the vpower petrol from an mpg perspective.

,
wictod,Vario44... yes very confusing... they seem almost identical but on close inspection on the PDFs for each product the only visible difference is the metal anti-squeak shim profile.. If you go to the following links for the two you can see.. there's also some drawings with dimensions that are marked differently for each type.. these PDFs are related to the wva number which is also different for each set... I can't answer which is the correct one unless the wva number is on the old pads or you can see the anti squeak plate profile and match it.. I suspect both types will work as they are both listed..https://www.bremboparts.com/europe/en/catalogue/pad/P_23_185/pdfhttps://www.bremboparts.com/europe/en/catalogue/pad/P_23_187/pdfUPDATE: after reviewing the PDFS again it appears the 185 variant covers a lot more of the different models than the 187.. quite why that is relevant I don't know .. check your exact model against their listed ones .. suspect yours comes up on both lists.Cheers
Vario44,Thanks mate for looking into this and I think you're right it's just the anti-squeak profile. Both are listed as compatible so will order some and see.
Per1,"So, I'm at 7000 miles on the clock, since July 2021, and last drove my Quadrifoglio on Monday 11th.Have a family get together near Peterborough tomorrow so need petrol. Started the car and she sounds like she's running on just 3 cylinders - lifted the bonnet and right bank is very noisy tappety/ticking sounds.Decided not to drive the car - could have been sticking pistons but not sure - sounds like coil pack failure, or a misfireAny thoughts?Will be going to dealership on Tuesday so they can see what the problem is.And there I was swearing on how improved Alfa's have become - my 2003 156GTA never missed a beat. Was hoping for similar trouble free motoring with my Quadrifoglio!"
,
Zyp,Any update on this?
Per1,"There was one other incident of this odd start up, and mentioned to the dealer when I was up for service but they found no faults. No idea what or why but will keep an ear out if it happens again!"
Imoan2,"Mine is a Giulia Quad and when left for extended periods (usually about a week) starts up on what appears to be less cylinders than i paid for and runs pretty rough but I just drive through it and it after a mile or so it's back to the way it should be.It really bothered me the first time but I've just accepted that this is a quirk although, obviously I could be way off the mark.Hope this helps....."
Per1,"Same here - settles down fairly soon after, but unnerving when she starts and sounds rougher than an 80-a-day cigarette smoker!"
Imoan2,At least when the ticking noise stops it doesn't go BOOM!!!
rjc147,Interesting alternative to a sports exhaust upgrade
,
cue2,I thought it was another post by that clickbaiter and his noisy QV again!
Deman77,Why aren’t mods shutting that thing down? I would ask in that thread but I don’t want to give him what he wants
Deman77,rjc147 said:Interesting alternative to a sports exhaust upgradeClick to expand...Doesn’t seem like much of an improvement. Also inside the car it will be always less audible.
Stelvio1,"What is that system?I had an Audi SQ5 that had a system that fed sound into the exhaust, is that something similar?"
sabas7,Exactly.Does anybody has an Alfa with a Sound Booster?
Vario44,"Hi everyone,Just got a remap done by AHM motorsport and would thoroughly recommend.....it feels like a rocket ship now!It is noticeably much quicker to 60 and still pulls nicely in every gear. I was worried that it wouldn't be that noticeable given that the power has only increased by about 30-40bhp (didn't get a printed read out so this is estimated) but it now pulls like a train. The 210 version of the diesel is to quite a hi-tune so this seems to be the safe limit with this engine.The thing that really makes the difference is that it now has an instant throttle response which is very, very noticeable- especially in the 0-40 range. At the top end (if you were on a track of course) it still pulls much harder up to 100 but it will never compete with an Audi diesel equivalent (SQ5 etc) and you can still feel it running out of puff at the top end.MPG has also increased by quite a bit. From Dover to Reading pre-remap I was getting 44.5MPG (V Power diesel driving as fast as road conditions would safely allow). Post-remap on the way back in similar conditions it averaged out at 48.9mpg so the map will pay for itself in time. As a comparison over 800 miles of mixed (but mainly urban) driving it usually puts out 34.5 mpg on a mix of Vpower and normal shell diesel.Spoke to the guys at AHM and they're not fitting aftermarket LSD's to the diesel models at the moment (likely ever). They've heard of an option to put in race mode but for some reason it stops the paddles working so I wouldnt recommend.They also programmed a key so I can do a remote engine start ... very neat and great to get the car cool in summer or warm in the winterThoroughly recommend having it done it really does transform the car and as always I'd go with AHM as they really know their stuff!"
,
alfaitalia,"Cool....don't take much notice of the mpg until you measure it tank top to tank top. Remaps on diesels often make the mpg reading optimistic as the ECU does not ""know"" extra fuel is being injected. If you use the extra performance you will use more fuel... can't beat physics. My 159 said a 4 or 5 mpg improvement in mpg after remap....reality was much the same or slightly worse depending on how much I used the extra go....but extra mpg was not the reason I had it done!"
Vario44,Very good point! It was an important bargaining chip with the missus though when I was trying to get her to have it done (it is technically her car) 😅.

Maximus84,"Morning all,My wife has just informed me she's scraped the back end against a post while in a car park. The door is scratched (may be able to buff out) but the black plastic wheel arch trim is cracked and will need to be replaced.Does anyone know of a decent site for acquiring a replacement? I quick eBay search is about £48. Are the easy to remove/fit?I'll attach pics when I get them...Thanks."
,
Maximus84,
cue2,"Be careful and order the parts from a main dealer. They’re often cheaper than eBay. The eBay ad may give you a part number to search out. Also, consider getting the wheel arch parts painted. It makes cleaning a Stelvio easier and you could reuse the damaged part. I didn’t have any damage but it cost £350 to get them painted including the full filler primer required for self coloured polypropylene parts."
pocholin,"The arch is challenging to remove because of the large amount of clips and the fact that you have to ""rip it off"". Make sure to purchase the clips along with the arch is you buy from eBay. As mentioned by cue2, you will be better off buying it from the dealer to ensure fit. It is easy to install, the arch comes with all the clips if you buy from the dealer.This is where I documented the replacement on my Stelvio, you'll find the part number for yours in that thread. Luckily for you, it is the cheaper one, the QV uses a smooth arch that comes primed and ready for painting:Wheel arch replacementHi everyone...it is very weird but I lost the driver side wheel arch! How? I have no idea! I was about to take measures for universal mud flaps when I noticed it missing. I haven't driven fast since last time I saw it, probably at the car wash? Somebody stole it in a store parking lot? All...www.stelvioforum.com"
cue2,I was going to buy the primered arch trims but the ‘shop I used simply used the grained parts and prepared them.
matty74,"Sorry to hear about that, personally I’d stick with the correct part in black, looks better on the Red Stelvio anyway.Plus if / should it happen again (god forbid) you’d be faced with an arch plus repaint to put it right.Hope you get it sorted soonSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
Maximus84,"Thanks for the replies, gents. I haven't yet had a chance to explore the dealer option but for now I'll probably stick with the black trim (though the painted ones do look good!The one I've seen on eBay looks to be a genuine part, and clips can be bought fairly easily it seems. The current one isn't torally secure, but isn't going to fall off.@pocholin- thanks for the link, was it fairly easy to fit in the end?What's worse is the pain on the door just prior to the trim has a slight crease and that's taken the brunt of it. The paint has cracked an in part flaked off to reveal what appears to be the metal underneath. Damn."
pocholin,"I hope you noticed there are two types of clips, I didn't pay close attention but there is a slight difference between them. Fitting it back in place was very simple, start with the front, there's a small lip that inserts into the back of the lower valance (if that is the right word)."

pocholin,"Yes, some are green and some are orange. I do remember the green ones locked into the arch differently than the orange ones but I didn't pay close attention to more details. That would be my only hesitation of just buying clips off eBay, rather get the OEM ones that come with everything...IMO."
cue2,People on here are always referring to dealers as “stealers” etc but their parts prices aren’t too bad sometimes and you get guidance to get the right parts as well as getting them new. The paint shop didn’t need to replace all of the clips when they painted them and refitted them as they understood the theory of the two types of clip. The fixing locator is probably on one end and the rest slide out in an arc.
matty74,Exactly … partsworld and alfaworkshop are a great source for original parts … here’s some bits added to the backSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
Maximus84,"So it turns out the arch trim is the least of my problems!a local body shop have quoted over £2k to fix the paintwork!! That's to respray the door and blend to the surrounding panels, plus repair the wheel damage. The local 'smart' repairer won't even touch it, and the aluminium doors make it even more difficult. Great."

Davelechem,I’m looking at buying a Stelvio asap. Current X5 is a bit thirsty in the current climate!I would want Speciale spec (can someone tell me what Milano Edizions gets you other than the wheels)?Any advice for things to look out for would be great (2018ish model). Would people recommend an extended warranty and what are the servicing costs like?Thanks in advanceps. Anyone wishing to sell please DM me;-)
,
Davelechem,I should add I’m looking at the 210bhp diesel
cue2,"Alfa Romeo Official Website | SUVs & Crossover | Alfa Romeo UKDiscover the entire Alfa Romeo range, offers & services. Book a test drive, download a brochure or find your nearest Retailer.www.alfaromeo.co.ukspecs are listed here.(adding to Speciale trim) includes sporty full leather seats, a 10 speaker Sound Theatre, , 20” V-spoke alloy wheels, Keyless entry, and an Athermic windshield. Privacy glass with black gloss window surrounds, electrically adjustable and heated front seats and a rear-view camera with dynamic grid lines enhance the standard specification.(Speciale also got electric seats but not Sports style.)"
alfaitalia,Personally Id look very long and hard at buying any diesel right now....sure it might cost less in fuel (although they don't burn much less than the 2.0 petrol in the real world apparently and of course derv costs a bit more than petrol)....but any money you might save could be eating up with all the charges that are being introduced for derv owners by various towns and cities.....just because it might be compliant now does not guarantee how long it will be.....One of the reasons my diesel (159) is going.......
Davelechem,Thanks for the advice mate. Yeh the diesel thing is a concern but my commute as almost 60 miles so it’s hard to look past the figures.voupd anyone advise on real world mpg figures? They look amazing on paper!!….
cue2,Is a Euro 5 Alfa 159 able to go everywhere?My 210 diesel is Euro 6 and it’s not amazing for mainly urban use but it’s still better than a 1.4 petrol Giulietta for mpg.
alfaitalia,Nope.....not ULEZ compliant...
cue2,Get rid ASAP.
alfaitalia,Yep....Im not worried.....its mileage means it has little value anyway....It cant really depreciate that much more! There are lots of cheap high end derv cars being sold in the London area....pre-empting the expansion of the ULEZ to the M25....also makes motorhome ownership all but impossible for all but the keenest as most won't comply being commercial vehicle based. Not a lot of thought gone into this I think....anyway.......way off topic.....
cue2,"Back to the Stelvio. I chose a Speciale when ordering mine new. I was offered a Milano for the same price but didn’t want keyless entry or the sport seats as the leather on the bolsters always age badly. The 20” wheels also, I didn’t want but I’ve since bought 20” wheels for my Speciale."
Andy1671,I have the Milano 280 petrol went from Mitsubishi diesel (45mpg) because of the worry around derv cars getting picked on by governmentI do 20 miles each way to work mainly motorway most of it is crawling through 50 mph roadworks thoughI am showing around 28/29 mpg . It will give 35 ish on a decent run
Davelechem,Thanks Andy. Not too dissimilar to my current x5. Hoping the diesel Alfa will be nearer 40
Isotope,"I got out of a Speciale diesel Giulia for the same reasons as already stated, the one thing I would say is no matter how you drove it you would get 35mpg every day, I know the Stelvio is a bit heavier but they are really are a nice place to be in diesel or petrol, incidentally same torque on both engines. Going back to your original request I know most of the diesels have foglights, not sure what option headlights were available in 2018 but if you have a choice make sure you get the 35W, my Speciale was 25W and that was about the one thing I could criticise on the Giulia. I have the touchscreen in mine, its nice but not a reason to pay the extra premium a newer model might command."
Isotope,I just looked on Autotrader and you might even be looking at halogen headlamps in 2018?

The quality of my interior is top notch But EVERY review I read about Alfas disses it.My 2007 159 Sportwagon has wear on the driver’s bolster and the car is treated like a workhorse but nothing is broken and there are no rattles at 240k. How can German cars have a better quality interior?"
GVblue,I just don't get all this fuss about interior quality. I didn't find it lacking on my Brera and it certainly isn't lacking on our Giulia and Stelvio. And what is quality about sticking an I-pad on top of the dash as the Germans do?PS Just watching 'Grace' on tv and and the main character has just turned up at the murder scene in his 159.

Maybe if the journos had to spend their own money they would be able to post a realistic and unbiased review.....

Even if it does not go well Alfa will get a ton of positive press out of just printing the pictures.I suspect this is Stellantis paid attempt to pump up Alfa brand name with a market leading (for the purpose) product. They need to remind people what are best cars to drive at the moment before they intoroduce their rebadged electric pugs.
alfaitalia,Not wanting to get into detail on it...it's late and I'm knackered....but just to say that I think the Stelvio/Giulia owners on here are writing stuff about there interiors that's just as biased as you believe the Autocar stuff is to German cars!

pocholin,"Bias for the brand we drive makes us look past the shortcomings of the Stelvio, I get it. Setting aside the fact that the Stelvio is not a luxury brand, like many of the German and British rivals, let's recognize that, although, interior quality is not bad, it is indeed not on par with other vehicles in the same price range (albeit luxury); we have wind noise on the lower part of the front doors (I've never heard the door clang though), entry-level Chrysler parts (turn signal and wiper levers, window switches and A/C controls) that don't have any premium feel to them and a few fit and finish things that are also inherited by the Chrysler influence.This car is great, not because of its interior, but because of its looks, the way it drives and the amazing engine it has, that's what we're paying for and why we're willing to overlook the other shortcomings. I went from a Volvo V90 to the Stelvio QV because of the looks, engine and driving dynamics, the rest was a downgrade beginning with the size. A fully loaded Volvo V90 costs 25-28% less than the QV, yet interior quality, interior materials, cabin insulation, amenities (massaging and ventilated seats, adaptive cruise control, B&W sound system, HUD), and infotainment are better...how do you sell that to a buyer driven by facts and not emotions? We've talked about it in the forums, people that buy the Alfas are more willing to give up certain things for the driving experience Alfas give you versus a Porsche Macan that compromises some of those in the name of comfort and luxury. We accept and recognize those willingly, so let's recognize and accept the other ""luxury"" and quality shortcomings. My 2 cents."

Deman77,3 months worth of reports under the original link.his consumption is truly shocking at 20mpg. I red line mine on every outing and after warm up I’m either D or Race and I have 25 avg pushing 30 on long trips with 33 best.the only way I can see it doing that bad is either constant crawling traffic or hard acceleration and hard braking all the time.May be they run tyres silly low pressures.
925,"Hi, my 2017 Stelvio 280hp rides pretty much well however, quite often transmission kicks hard from 1st to 2nd gear (like kick in the butt or through transmission, i dont know), when moving slowly in traffic. This strictly happens when car is In fully normal temperature (4bars), not when it is cold or just started. Then, with hard upshift, you can clearly feel sort of vibration/pulsing when accelerating hard. Ir can be felt in all modes. in A mode it is slightly less agressivelly expressed but you can clearly feel hard thump 1st->2nd, later gears are ok, but vibration persists. it’s also pronounced in D mode, manual and hard acceleration. It’s like repeating slight vibration/pulsing through rpm range. It’s not every single time i drive but in general vibration appears quite often.Wheels are aligned, no codes on dashboard."

Simon156,"I’ve just bought a 2020 Veloce (picture to follow) and I’m working out the myriad features.One question I still have is the central,display in a mode.

,
Simon156,That’s the a mode of dna to be clear.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk
Isotope,A mode is trying be as efficient as possible the gearbox short shifts and maximum power is cut in order to save fuel and impact on the environment. The four dots tell you that there are four available screens in that mode and the one that is filled in is the one you are on. D and N modes give more power etc but if you are looking for economy first and foremost you've probably bought the wrong version of the car?
manc350,"To be fair, and backed up by other users, I get the same economy in N or A mode but it is nicer to drive in N mode than A mode...... Mine is a 2021 Veloce.Also recommend you download the user manual from Alfa website, easier to search through, if you don't already have it go to here -Alfa Romeo – FAQ & Glossary | Alfa Romeo UKor get the myalfa connect app for your phone and access the user manual through thatDon't expect too much info re the display though.. it is rather basic...Click the button at the bottom of the page and follow the instructions.. also pretty sure if you setup a my alfa account you can get it there.Oh and enjoy the car, i got mine in Sept 2021 and am really enjoying it !!"
pocholin,"The vehicle's manual only mentions the screen graphic but it doesn't give details on the globe or stars. It only explains the cars with the left arrow (acceleration), right arrow (deceleration) and gear selector.I've noticed that people don't really appreciate the advantages of A vs N, either because they haven't spent enough time in that mode, or don't care for the features. There is a marked difference in performance and behavior of the car, especially if you are driving on the freeway for extended periods of time.I drive a QV, so gas consumption is not my main concern...however, I am against wasting gas on long highway trips where I keep the car at constant speeds for long periods of time. I use A mode any time I will be in the freeway for more than 10 miles. For the QV, the engine shots down 3 cylinders from time to time (and for a limited amount of time), the transmission disengages and uses neutral when coasting down (between 87 MPH and 64 MPH to engage), the transmission is smoother/slower, seeks 8th gear in the mid 40 MPH, reduced engine power and slower gas pedal reactions, all of which contribute to a more efficient drive. There's still acceptable amount of passing power for most cases, if you think you'll need more, quickly switch to N and you have plenty of power."

They serviced the car and the change oil message was removed but they cannot reset the scheduled maintenance required message that now says I need service in 900 miles or 34 days.

sloef,"Hi all. After my Giulia got nicked back in January (as described in the radar cover story), I decided to move across and to buy a low mileage second hand Stelvio from the insurance money. Overall I'm quite pleased with the car, different beast to drive, seating position is quite different but overall I'm very happy. There is however two niggles that I'd like to find out if other Stelvio owners (or Stelvio owners that came from a Giulia like me) have the same experience.First up is, what my selling dealer describes as ""tyre noise combined with aggressive camber"". To me the sensation feels like something is either rubbing against the wheel or that the hub is not running freely. It's a sensation that I definitely did not have with the Giulia 19 inch staggered wheels. These are 20 inch wheels with Michelin Latitude Sport 3 tyres, still plenty of life on them. I took another Stelvio at the dealer with Pirelli P Zeros and it seemed to have the same sensation albeit a lot less. Do others have this? Is this really just the tyres communicating up to the steering wheel? If so, I will have to get used to it. For the record, I'm very well aware of the reverse Ackerman phenomenon at slow speeds. This is not it, it is at all speeds, all road services and all directions. Tried at different tyre pressures as well. It went in twice to the dealer for this and they claim it is fine and not different from other Stelvios.Secondly the car has this ridiculously sensitive headlight sensor. Literally driving on a bright sunny day under a few trees makes the lights come on or any underpass etc. Changing sensitivity in the menu makes no difference. All this switching on and off surely will reduce the life span if these bulbs? Is this the case on all Stelvios? Even worse is that you can't switch the headlights off properly, it's either Auto or On (when driving), something I solved by installing a second hand headlight switch from a Giulia QV so at least I can switch the lights off when it's going all flashy on me. With the Giulia I left it in auto and it was almost perfect, even a little bit too insensitive. Is anyone aware of a sensitivity setting in MES for this sensor? Might it have to do with the sensor not seating properly (although the rain sensor works fine)? Should I push for a warranty repair? Again the dealer claims that there's nothing he can do.Looking forward to your input!"
,
Deman77,"Light sensor is trigger happy. It doesn’t like high contrast situations. I noticed the same, but for dusk, night driving it works fine.regarding the rolling sensation. Not sure about others but QV definitely has a bit of a slack at the start of the suspension travel which results in a fidget over less than perfect surfaces. I feel it more through slight pitch and roll. It’s fine when you are pushing just messes up comfort when driving steady. could this be what you are feeling?"

I feel it more through slight pitch and roll. It’s fine when you are pushing just messes up comfort when driving steady. could this be what you are feeling?[/QUOTE]To me it feels like for example a brake pad is in constant contact with the disk for lack of a better description. Or that the wheel hub doesn't run freely.. According to the dealer the aggressive camber means that the tyres are attacking the road and this is what I feel in the steering wheel.
Deman77,"That seems a bit far fetched. Yes the car responds like a sports car in the bend and suspension geometry helps but I feel it only happens when you lean into it. When rolling straight and steady it feels fairly free. May be check your geometry in case smth is out of whack.you should be able to see it through uneven tyre wear, poor consumption or steering pull. If none of those I suspect it’s fine."
cue2,"It all sounds a bit non-typical to me, not even recognising what you describe. What age was it when you bought it?"
sloef,"Checked geometry and all fine, tyre wear is even, no pulling.Less than 3 years old, 12000 miles.I have no other way than describing it as ""something in contact with the wheel"". Maybe it's just the tyre's contact with the road which I feel in the steering?"
Isotope,"I had a Giulia TD Speciale with staggered runflats and other than the ackerman noises it handled really well but wore the inner edges on all of the tyres alarmingly fast about 7,000 miles a go. I swapped to a Stelvio last year and I can't say I've experiencced what you describe or even the Ackerman noises, I'm also on the 20"" Latitiudes and currently on 13,000 miles with about 4mm left on all of the tyres. The only strange sensation I get is when accelarating around a corner there appears to be an extra delay before you get the extra power in the turn? Could that be torque vectoring or is it just the QV's that have it? Also why does ESC intervention cancel ACC on what I think are fairly gentle bends?"
Zyp,"I assume there’s no issue purchasing a service plan and extended warranty from one dealer and then using another dealer for any service and work?That aside, anyone used Stoneacre Chesterfield for servicing?Its a toss up between them and Research for distance from me.Cheers."

paultrim,"Regarding service plans, if you purchased a MOPAR plan, it can be used at any ARUK dealership. 👍"

I bought a service plan with my new Stelvio from elsewhere and Stoneacre knew all about it when I booked it in for the first service. They also sorted out the warranty work on the fuel sensor recall last month and usually give me a Giulietta as a loan car albeit a manual! If you ask for Eliza, she is the Alfa service rep."
Zyp,"Thanks.I notice that Research class themselves as a Quadrifoglio service centre - not sure about Stoneacre, or if it actually makes any difference?"

cue2,I’m getting 33mpg with mainly urban/suburban driving with my 210hp diesel. That’s about what I used to get with my Giulietta MA Speciale on 18” wheels. The Stelvio is on 20s and I do 4000 miles a year in it so I’m not feeling too guilty about running a euro 6 diesel.
Deman77,"19 average on QV here - short trips, hilly, suburban, hardly drop below 3k rpm once warmed up (sub 3k till warm) and max out regularly.I saw 33 on deliberate light throttle mainly motorway 50mile run (she shuts down 3cyl on light throttle) but it feels like abuse driving car like this in that manner.

Pedr0,"My car is a 2018 Giulia 2.0TB Super. My best consumption so far was 44mpg over a 200mile motorway run, but the final 10 miles of urban dropped it below 40. And there is the clue. Most of my journeys are extra urban and I tend to get low to mid 30s, but any urban driving drives it down to at least mid 20s, and even to about 19 occasionally. So petrol cars are much more variable than diesel in this respect in my experience.When I first had the car (a year ago) I drove in A (eco) resorting to D for overtaking, but after a few ""junction anxiety"" incidents ( short delay in throttle response), I abandoned that and now drive in N (I've not detected any effect on fuel consumption), but still using D for overtaking (or a bit of fun). Also, I always disable engine stop/start, again to avoid junction anxiety, and since I do little urban driving, any negative effect on fuel consumption is insignificant.Anyway, if our primary concern was fuel consumption, surely we wouldn't have bought these cars?"

Not bad considering I had 3 adults, one child, two small dogs...and I was driving at 75-76 MPH. Not bad at all for a QV. I do drive it in A when I know I'm getting on the freeway."
Deman77,Tried driving my QV for better mpg on a boring dual carriageway trip and it really does seem that A is less efficient than N.It was a 60 mile trip in perfect conditions 15c and I went 65ish anticipating slow downs so not really using brakes and no hard acceleration. It was Essex to Suffolk so rolling hills - not very flat. On the way there in N I had 36.1mpg after 40 miles before I hit 15min slow traffic at the end which brought it down to 31.The return in A I had 31mpg over about 40 miles doing very similar before I hit traffic and it went to 29.On the way back the car was a bit lighter too but 3 passengers and full boot both ways.It is not exactly like for like but 20% difference indicates N was better no matter how you spin it.I don’t know what it is (3cyl mode should be engaging in both). I did not see either working gears excessively. I tried to use light throttle in both to be building speed in 8th.We do know A has restricted torque and power and N and D only does in lower 3 gears. So perhaps the inefficient acceleration phase takes longer in A due to lower power so it spends more time accelerating and less time cruising.
pocholin,"I also have a QV, in A mode, when you start accelerating, the engine returns to 6 cyl, 3 cyl function will only last up to 100 seconds and then go back to 6 cyl.In my recent 1,450 mile trip (in one day) I paid close attention to this handover, I did see that when the engine goes to 3 cyl the boost goes from 3-4 PSI to 0 PSI, US MPG goes down immediately then recovers to the same levels as before (perhaps better?? I'm not sure). The advantage of A mode is that when you coast, on a down hill or because of traffic in front of you, the transmission goes into neutral, furthermore, the transmission is quick to get into higher gears and that's where it saves gas. My best tank was a 23.4 MPG US (28.1 MPG Imperial), for that tank I was cruising between 77 and 82 MPH but I did have a strong tail wind helping, I normally got 22.3 MPG US with normal wind conditions.To your point, under certain conditions N mode can be more efficient than A, but if you take advantage of coasting down, getting to 8th gear quick and feathering the gas pedal I do believe A mode wins."

I have a MY18 (built Dec 2018) and although there do not appear to be any outstanding recalls from what I can see, I have no idea what version of software the car is running. I'll probably ask the workshop to check at next service but just curious to hear from the forum.Otherwise, a fantastic motor! My favourite of all cars I've ever owned.BestBB"

alfaitalia,"Really?????....that's 24 hours of driving at an average of 60.42mph........ never stopping for fuel or toilet break or slowing down....so in reality you would need to be doing 100mpg plus everywhere....at which speed would need even more fuel stops, killing the average even more. Seems unlikely to me....."
pocholin,"Really, that was a 20 hours and 25 minutes of drive, I left Big Bend National park (in US West Texas) at 3:50 am, got to Chicago, IL at 12:15 am the following night. I was originally going to split the trip in two days, leave Texas around 9 or 10am but since I was done taking pictures at 3am and I felt very fresh I decided to start driving. I was cruising at around 82 MPH for the most, then I followed this guy for almost 2.5 hours doing 90-95 MPH and the last 4 hours of the trip I cruised at around 78 MPH.I am about to post a long post on this 4,000 mile trip...look for it in a couple of minutes"
Deman77,Idling engine out of gear needs to burn more fuel to turn it over than the engine in gear coasting down or going downhill because the kinetic energy from the wheels is turning over the engine. So turning to neutral as fuel saving feature is a myth. It’s also less safe. I doubt A mode does that. My Volvo used to turn the engine off when coasting in eco mode but i did not see QV do that in A.I also see almost no gear changes at 60-70 dual carriageway grind as QV can pretty much pull in 8th at light throttle. N chases high gears like crazy - I would sometimes override to shift down in auto in urban traffic as I know I need to slow down and it would be in 7th at 35mph. I doubt A would be even more conservative. I suspect reduced boost/power is pretty much all it does differently.

Whether or not it saves gas I don't know but it does use neutral.
Deman77,"Did 600mile return trip Essex to Lake District. Routed a third via Yorkshire dales on the way there and via a65 on the way back to try and reduce boring motorways without too much time penalty. Those are pretty drives but super inefficient as lots of elevation changes and bends. Also had 60-70miles of local traffic to the walks during my stay which was very inefficient.3 passengers and full boot. Pz4 tyres 38/41psi. Esso99 or Shell vpower.Overall trip average 28.2mpgReturn trip 29.9mpg. That’s 2/3 motorway and 1/3 bendy roads.Drove for comfort in N (tried manual last 100 miles and that improved things noticeably so it must shift down imperceptibly a fair bit in auto), but did do a few carbon clearing red line accelerations. I go as fast as the traffic lets me without breaking the limits, leaving largish gap in front to minimise using brakes.Motorway only is comfortably in the low-mid 30s. Using ACC uses brakes a fair bit and accelerates more aggressively than I would - the mpg is around 31 on the motorway with ACC set to 71mph.Dropping to 60mph and going with slower traffic would improve to mid 30s and drafting behind lorries one could easily push 40mpg - absolutely no doubt. I do not possess those levels of patience or spare time for a long trip though.The averages take a hard hit if you get slow motorway grind. In stop/start traffic it’s low teens."
pocholin,"Part 1 of 2To be exact, the round trip was 3,943 miles. I am sharing my car experiences of a trip I started on May 19 and finished on June 1st, 2022. I started in Chicago, IL drove to Memphis, TN where I spent the night and ended up in Houston, TX. Because of construction, Google maps sent me on an 1,120 mile route to Houston that was shorter in time; the first part of the trip was uneventful, as it should be on any car. No surprises, electronic gizmos, check engine lights, or anything like that. I was by myself plus some luggage, ice chest and camera some equipment.A few notable remarks that I learned on this, my first long road trip:Fuel gauge reminds me of 1990s Chevy cars!!! The first half of the tank lasts a lot, it makes you hopeful that you will get 450 miles…however, the last “quarter” will last you 50-60 miles, even though stated range shows “90-100” when you first reach that point! I know I was very close to running out when I loaded 16.46 gal. I was about 48 miles away from the gas station I had in mind when range first said 90 miles to empty!Windshield and radar (however it is called, the thing mounted on the bumper) must remain clean in order to work well. I lost adaptive cruise control early in the morning in Arkansas because of bugs. Even the car threw a related error. Error went away and system worked again as soon as I cleaned those areas at a gas station. An annoyance (Volvo was more resilient to dirt and bugs), but understandable.Cruising between 77 & 82 MPH, the car gets good mileage, I averaged 27.3 UK MPG on this first leg, which included construction traffic along the freeway, stop lights and cruising in Memphis’ downtown…a couple of 0-80 MPH runs and a couple 75-125 MPH runs just to keep things lively.I have found that Trip computer is almost as accurate at dividing driven miles by amount of fuel, the trick is resetting the trip computer at the gas station without rolling the car…accurate within a tenth (trip computer 27.3 vs 22.15 manual calculation).Gas mileage while cruising at 90-95 MPH for most of the tank (I was following a guy) was 23.66 MPG by the trip computer and 23.5 by manual calculation.While the seats are not as comfortable as the prior Volvo V90 I had, they are still comfortable, you don’t get super tired…worth nothing that when I first got the car the back of my ribs hurt for a few days, past the initial pain the seats become comfortable.I was in Houston until the afternoon of the 24th and headed to West Texas. During my stay in Houston I ran the car hard many times and had my fun with it. I got the check engine light three times, P0039, which I know are my diverter valves, it happens when I use Map2 with the JB4. Common issue and they will need to be replaced, not the car’s fault though. Been using Map1 now.As some of you might know, the mass shooting at Uvalde, TX happened last week, I happen to drive right through the town on my way to Semoline State Park, so I stopped to pay my respects, powerful and humbling being there, here are a couple of pictures.I spent half of the evening at this park, disappointed because I couldn’t get the photos I was hoping for, more light pollution than originally anticipated. Here’s one, the USA is to the left of the river and Mexico is to the right.Car did very good because of a strong diagonal tail wind we got for the last 200 miles of Sunday’s drive, despite the stop at Uvalde and the several traffic lights. It averaged 28.1 MPG in 400 miles (pic shows it in US Gal).The morning of the 30th I headed to Big Bend National Park, visited a couple of places that require taking dirt roads and a heavier off road that does state “4-wheel drive” required. Nothing major a few up hills and down hills had a 9 degree slope. I did take it slow on the rocky areas being careful not to damage the wheels or the tires…but especially the wheels. I was more relaxed last year in the Volvo though. The car does very well and I learned that the car will get out of almost everything by just letting go of the brake and letting it creep/roll on its own. Suspension has such short travel, it doesn’t take much to make it go on two wheels!I went to Big Bend to stargaze, here are some pics from the trip."

TheGrimJeeper,A real road trip adventure with a somber interlude.Do you carry a spare in the Stelvio? Chance of pinching up against a rock with those low-profiles on horseshoes would have me on edge the whole time.
pocholin,"I don't carry a spare, relied solely on the repair kit."
pocholin,"Part 2 of 2For the sunset of the 30th, I drove further west along the Rio Grande, that drive was very curvy and fun! I only had the car on A mode but it was enough for what I needed to do. You go from 70-80 MPH straights to 35 MPH turns (yellow recommended speed was 25 MPH), the car really shines on these roads! Here are some pics of the area where I stopped for the sunset.I drove about 100 miles of dirt and off roads, I crossed rocky and sandy washes, steep gravel wash crosses, etc, the car has handled everything with flying colors, easier than the Volvo did last year, I am impressed at how efficient the car uses the AWD and is able to put power to the wheel with traction; the morning of the 31st I tested the system on a big rock on a loosen gravel area, it took the system less than two seconds to realize only thedriverpassenger front side had traction and put power to it, here’s a picture of that:My time had come to an end at the park, but not without attempting a full run with the Stelvio, still on Map1, I ended up with a check engine light…not sure if before or after the car recorded the 1/4 mile time and speed…not bad though…considering the outside temp was 38C when I did this, I’ve been on 91 octane for the past two tanks and I was at 3,700 ft elevation, the outside temp indicator in the car showed 45CLast picture before leaving the park!Car passing 16,666 and 17,777 on the same day! Heck, I drove 1,453 miles in 20 hours and 25 minutes, I was tired at the end of the trip, the car did fantastic. During this last drive of the trip the car averaged 25.2 MPG, this is where I followed the guy @90-95 MPH for over two hours and I also got the car up to 145 MPH only once; most of the trip I drove around 82-85 MPH…so 25.2 MPG is great for this car.One last picture with the beautiful background:"

TonyGr,The Saxo was insured with RAC last year (renewal 1st April) for £117.53. The renewal came in at £141.86 (20.7% higher). Having researched the market this year's insurance is with........................................................................RAC. I could not get a better deal or at least it was so little less it wasn't worth the hassle of changing and having to prove NCD etc.On the other hand the Giulietta was insured with Aviva (again with a 1st April renewal) for £250.79 and the renewal came in at £256.60 (2.3%) so I didn't bother cancelling the auto renewal.Who can fathom the workings of the insurance industry?

Jambo,Hi. I’ve just got back from my first long drive in my new Stelvio. Circa 3hrs each way. On each journey about 2hrs in the GPS location takes a big knock and can’t lock back onto the correct location again. This completely knocks out the sat nav and of course my wife gets very anxious and shouty!it might be a hardware aerial problem?But I’m wondering is it software? Each time after about 2hrs driving with all ok.does anyone know the latest software for a 2021 Stelvio?Or experienced the same?
,
Jambo,
Old Engineer,This must be an aerial problem?
Old Engineer,Try this link...(10) Navigation lost location? | Alfa Romeo Forum (alfaowner.com)
JTD_Liam,"Not an Alfa but I've had the exact thing on my Fiat a couple of months ago, along with various other weird glitches with the UConnect system which had been flawless for nearly 3 years but has just started to misbehave over the summer. Was driving up the M6, two hours into a 3 hour journey and the GPS suddenly moved away from the M6 and said I was in the Peak District - sat nav arrival time and directions were jumping all over the shop. Tried cancelling the route and re-starting but it was having none of it. Problem didn't clear until i'd parked up for a few hours and went back out. Not occured since but other issues with Bluetooth connection & media track info freezing have.Issues with the aerial, causing DAB signal drop out are common across Alfa and Fiat (though usually it's the Giulietta affected rather than Stelvio/Giulia) so it's not beyond possibility that there's a shared issue with the GPS and perhaps it's linked to a recent software release - I don't know what software version my UConnect is currently running and my car is a 2018 model, but it appears to update UConnect over-the-air (it says it's doing this) and I seem to remember it doing this just before the problems started in the summer, so although there are differences to Alfa Connect and Fiat's UConnect, there could be commonality across the software that both systems are using.Mine's going into the dealer later this week as there were no updates available when I mentioned it at its service in September, but they reckoned an update was on its way, so I'll feed back if they're able to download some sort of patch to resolve the problems - presumably whilst it can do over the air updates, certain things have to be done via a wired update. Fiat UK are also involved with mine as it's now out of warranty but I don't intend to be paying for it (or the issue i have with lacquer peel on the alloys) since both issues were reported well within warranty."
Jambo,Thanks both.I've found some information to suggest that there is a newer firmware version around.But now trying to find my way through the Mopar sites to access the download.I'm sure it was much easier previously - but i can't find it anywhere yet.
Muz,"I used my inbuilt Sat Nav system for the first time on a trip at the weekend, after 30 mins I turned it off and went back to Waze on Apple Carplay. It’s in a different league imo and there is no stress about updates either."
Jambo,ThanksWhat I have learnt though is that apps on the phone will use the cars gps location when running CarPlay. So the gps position remains wrong.
jwq,"You're not going to find it.....The infotainment software is not available for user updates, the only official way is via the dealer.You will find some unofficial info here:infotainment updatesHaven't heard of any other problems with GPS reception on newer systems though ...."
Jambo,"Appreciated, thanks.Whether it’s the aerial or the software, I know that it definitely needs booking in. (a pity as its only done 600miles)"
Muz,"I didn’t know that! Good luck, disappointing and annoying for you I’m sure, hope it gets sorted sharpish."
JTD_Liam,"I didn't realise that either. Mine has to be looked at regardless as the Bluetooth connection is also dropping and refusing to reconnect unless I stop the engine and wait 5 minutes for everything to power down, which is an utter ballache on a motorway journey. The whole unit randomly switches itself off and back on at times too, but it's helpful to know that I can't rely on the phones GPS even if I switch to Google/Waze via Android Auto."
Jambo,"Interesting to know that you are seeing recovery after 5 mins of power down. I've not timed that, but it has recovered after a couple of hours parked up for lunch.The first time the nav system got itself lost it recovered after about 40 mins of driving. I'd been makeing better time on the return journey and didn't see recovery again. (But at least this was the return journey and i knew where i was going, so the wife wasn't panicing and chewing my ear off!).The car is booked in next week - hopefully a simple software update."

JTD_Liam,"It was a good few hours that I left it after the GPS problem so I don't know if that would've cleared after a 5 minute power-down, but that's always sorted the Bluetooth issue. Unlike the Alfa Connect system in the Stelvio & Giulia, in the Fiat the screen (7"" UConnect) has a combined power button & volume control which is backlit. When you switch off the ignition the backlight stays on for a few minutes - the key is to wait for that to go out and then power on the screen, then the problems seem to be solved. If I've tried switching it off & back on before the backlight has gone out, the problem remains. Whether there's a similar thing to look for in the Alfa's I'm not sure?Hopefully a software update will solve it for your Alfa and my Fiat. As I said I assume there will be some similarities in software, since your car is a 2021 & mine has had a dealer and over the air update in the past year."
JTD_Liam,"By way of an update, the car was at the dealer on Friday & unfortunately still no update available - it has the latest software.The dealer has spoken to Fiat to notify them of the problem. Again, unsure if it's the same issue as Alfa but looks like if it is software related, there's probably not an update yet."
Jambo,"Well my car has now been with the dealer for 2 days and I have just heard that Italy has advised to replace the aerial.Hopefully that arrives tomorrow, but will then need to be sprayed to match the car. Before replacing, which involves taking the headlining out of the car. Might be lucky and get the car tomorrow, else another 2 days. (I just hope nothing else gets damaged in the process! - fingers crossed).I'm surprised the aerial needs to be painted to match - I thought all Stelvio aerials were the same dark colour?Perhaps that is only the sunroof option? Still surprised it would not come in a standard black though as that does not need to match the car which is Misano Blue.I'm grumbling - but only because i miss my car and bumbling around with a 500X in the interim."

Jambo,Hi. Yes. The aerial was replaced.But that did not solve the problem.I was contacted a couple of days later for a recall of software update to the geolocation function. After the software update it’s been ok I think.I’d ask the dealer to check the software version to be checked. It took most the day for the updates as there were many other knock on software updates required.
Donzo,"Thank you.I'm arranging for it to go back to the dealer. Basically it's okay sometimes, but on longer trips it tends to ""wander off"" into the countryside!Can I ask which dealership you were at? I'll tell my dealer to speak to yours if they're not sure!.....Very frustrating as it's a great car."

Donzo,Thanks.I'll actually be near that branch soon - and might book it in there to save recreating the wheel with my local garage.

bazza,Why are they talking about them both in the past tense?
cue2,I tried to ask that in a comment but they are not open to comments from new users.
cue2,"“In an attempt to rein in weight, the Quad's doors, bonnet and wheel arches were made of aluminium “An attempt? Would it be an attempt if Porsche did it?"
lussoman,Maybe they know something we don'tHopefully the marque will be around for a little longer yet.
cue2,The factory seems to have real issues with supplies of chips and wiring looms which are stopping production most of the time.
Scudetto,Isn’t that a problem many manufacturers are facing at the moment? I think Toyota’s production was down quite a bit recently due to that. Let’s hope it gets resolved soon.
cue2,But they don’t refer to Toyota in the past tense.
Muz,"Aren’t you maybe being a little precious here? They are referring to the Stelvio Quad not Alfa.I am going for them being quite positive as they know that Alfas are better than perceived by so many, like most of us.“A lot of careful brand-building will need to go on over the next few years for Alfa Romeo to be perceived in the same light as firms like Porsche”I suggest that that Porsche are over rated and Alfa under rated by Joe Public. I have had more expensive problems with Porsche than any of my recent Alfas, and I doubt I’m alone."
cue2,I’m being a little precious?As far as I know the Quadrifoglio is still listed as a new car.
Muz,It was your comment about Toyota that prompted it. The article is quite good but the use of the past tense is just lazy journalism
cue2,"To answer your question, I don’t think I’m being a little precious. Porsche is never in the past tense as they keep the names for ever, to the benefit of their image. The new Alfa boss is missing a trick by creating the feeling of yet another relaunch of Alfa. The progressive development of a range infers confidence in the product to the press and the customers but he’s not helping the marque."

Finally solved the ’turbo’ issue after 4 months( about 10 trips to the dealer ,with no courtesy car available EVER) , to be told the car needed a new front wiring loom , ok fix that please , then to be told the car needed a full wiring loom……… to which the dealer said , we will change the looms but we are not responsible if we damage or mark anything !!!! Are you being serious ,so we again called Alfa in Milan , who would not bend !! yes that’s Alfa,s company policy , so they wanted to strip the whole interior out of a £75k car because the whole wiring loom was faulty , and even tho it was still well under warranty , they wouldn’t change anything the totally incompetent dealer may have damaged or marked .after 5 months of arguing with Alfa I gave the car back at the garage I bought it from ( John Holland in Sheffield) who throughout the whole affair where brilliant and I got a full refund !!!I have a couple of friends who had leased / bought new Guilia’s with very similar stories , crap dealers , unreliable cars , Alfa UK totally uninterested / unhelpfullI wouldn’t touch a new Alfa even if they where the last car company in the world , I have a 147GTA which I love , obviously never goes near an official dealer , I‘m looking at a spider just now ,new Alfa’s( and their dealers ) are not in the same league of dealers like BMW, MERC,even Ford , never mind Porsche ….I also have a 2010 997.2 which I have owned for 6 years ( along with a Macan I replaced the Stelvio for ) ,totally professional service in every way ,absolutely nothing has went wrong with either car ( over many years I have owned various 911’s apart from a couple of very minor issues all good ,hence why I keep going back )the dealer knows what he is talking about and had a courtesy car pre booked for a service.I have always loved Alfa Romeo ,I am Italian ,I have been to the wonderful museum in Milan to look at all the glorious past Alfas ,BUTI will never consider a new Alfa ever again ,as far as I’m concerned they don’t make new cars !!!i seriously doubt they will survive long term ,the company is totally incompetent from the very top to the very bottom …..I laugh when people mention them as in the same league as Porsche , I would far rather drive an Alfa Romeo everyday , but , my head rules my heart now , no car or car dealer is perfect , Alfa are not even competent!!!!such a shame"

Are you being serious ,so we again called Alfa in Milan , who would not bend !! yes that’s Alfa,s company policy , so they wanted to strip the whole interior out of a £75k car because the whole wiring loom was faulty , and even tho it was still well under warranty , they wouldn’t change anything the totally incompetent dealer may have damaged or marked .after 5 months of arguing with Alfa I gave the car back at the garage I bought it from ( John Holland in Sheffield) who throughout the whole affair where brilliant and I got a full refund !!!I have a couple of friends who had leased / bought new Guilia’s with very similar stories , crap dealers , unreliable cars , Alfa UK totally uninterested / unhelpfullI wouldn’t touch a new Alfa even if they where the last car company in the world , I have a 147GTA which I love , obviously never goes near an official dealer , I‘m looking at a spider just now ,new Alfa’s( and their dealers ) are not in the same league of dealers like BMW, MERC,even Ford , never mind Porsche ….I also have a 2010 997.2 which I have owned for 6 years ( along with a Macan I replaced the Stelvio for ) ,totally professional service in every way ,absolutely nothing has went wrong with either car ( over many years I have owned various 911’s apart from a couple of very minor issues all good ,hence why I keep going back )the dealer knows what he is talking about and had a courtesy car pre booked for a service.I have always loved Alfa Romeo ,I am Italian ,I have been to the wonderful museum in Milan to look at all the glorious past Alfas ,BUTI will never consider a new Alfa ever again ,as far as I’m concerned they don’t make new cars !!!i seriously doubt they will survive long term ,the company is totally incompetent from the very top to the very bottom …..I laugh when people mention them as in the same league as Porsche , I would far rather drive an Alfa Romeo everyday , but , my head rules my heart now , no car or car dealer is perfect , Alfa are not even competent!!!!such a shameClick to expand...Stay salty, I guess."
cue2,Sounds like a “lemon” car somebody offloaded to a non-Alfa dealer. It’s a shame these cars aren’t bought up and fixed to avoid the reputational damage caused for everybody else‘s Quadrifoglios.
Paul S147 GTA,if it was only 1 car maybe — BUT there are a lot out their with the same faults — i know of several quad stelvio and Guilia that need new wiring looms and the dealer who tried to fix my car has 2 stelvio quads in just now with turbo issues — but let’s face it in arnold clark they are serviced along with Vauxhalls —- and don’t kid yourself they have no idea what to do with them — it’s Alfa Romeo that are the Lemons in the car world — and please i’m not an anti Alfa motorist — i love Alfa had them since Alfasud — 164 — GT the ‘new ‘ company is dreadful — customer service simply does not existi can name 5 people i know offhand who have owned guilia // stelvio loved the cars but unreliability and crap dealership / service — would never buy an alfa again —— they are destroying themselves
cue2,Did John Holland resell the car? It’s interesting that the number of Quads on Auto Trader is the same as Speciale models which sold more than double the volume. They are probably more of a car “tried”as one of an owners cars than a Speciale which gets used.

cue2,It’s strange as there’s been no mention on here by Stelvio Quadrifoglio drivers about wiring issues. Some Giulias until a certain time had to have a revised scuttle trim but no Stelvio wiring issues. It’d be interesting if you can confirm the car you bought is going fine now. It’s a shame the dealer didn’t drive it for a couple of hours before buffing it up all shiny and selling it to you…
Paul S147 GTA,the dealer drove it up from sheffield to glasgow with no issues — delivered it to my house — and i don’t like the ‘buff it up ‘ insinuatiion —- John Holland where absolutely tremendous throughout the whole affair !!!! always saying if the car is not perfect or i’m not happy with it after i get it back they would give me my money back and after 4 months of Alfa telling lies and giving no service whatsoever —- alfa romeo shares its workshop with Vauxhall techies i will say again they had no idea what they where dealing with — simply re setting the ecu and giving me it back —- 4-5 times this happened gave me it back - drive it for less than 2 miles and it went into limp mode again — no checking whatsoever — shockingly bad and as i’ve said Alfa themselves where equally as bad — rotten company rotten dealership rotten to the core — i don’t write this for the hell of it !!!why do you see so few new alfas on the road — ??? simple reason people know how bad they are — mitò guilietta— easy peasy re badged fiats so don’t come into the issues — anything else in the range — nightmare !!and let me repeat — alfa uk not interested — alfa milan not interested — both never returned phone calls or attempted to since the issues — because why —— nobody in the whole company gives a toss- amd i will repeat again John Holland where ASTOUNDINGLY good — best dealership j have ever dealt with — Alfa romeo simply the worst EVER —- shocking —- loads of stelvio and guilia suffer the same issues — dig deeper and you will find out — as i said the dealership near me has 3 in just now with turbo issues — said my piece several times now — maybe time to call this a day for me — no point in repeating myself 😉

cue2,I don’t intend to dig any deeper. I’ve had my non-Quadrifoglio Stelvio from new in December 2018 and found local Alfa dealers to be acceptable and I’m pleased with the car so I settled the final payment at 3 years.
Paul S147 GTA,glad to hear you have a good one 👍
GVblue,"Where you were really unlucky is that no one had the radar cover off and nicked it before it had chance to go wrong.Fortunately, for me at least, my experience with Alfa Romeo over the past forty years has been pretty much the opposite of yours. Yes, I have had issues but nothing sufficiently annoying/frustrating so as to fill me with the level of contempt your clearly now have for the brand."
Paul S147 GTA,yup make stunning cars that could obviously go wrong sometimes but with the older dealer network usually found someone who cared enough to fix themnow as you say total contempt !! shame — but that’s what they have for the people who take a huge risk and spend upwards of £60k of their hard earned money on one of their carsthey don’t give a toss — not one person myself or my wife spoke to from Alfa cared enough to call back never mind take it on board to try a solve the problem — any car / even business can have a quality issue — it’s how they deal with it shows the true quality of any brandyup total contempt for their customer is how Alfa choose to deal with it —- for OVER 4 months !!they only deserve likewiseas i say i still love the cars still have one ( maybe 2 soon)current company stinks to the core 😱
Muz,"My experience of Alfa customer service is a “couldn’t give a ****“ attitude. The Alfa garage I use is excellent, cheaper than a main dealer but not cheap, but they have sorted every problem with my Alfas quickly and efficiently. My experience with Porsche is that even though I used a very good Indy the parts costs are a complete rip off and the cars are nowhere near as bullet proof as the perceived wisdom and Porsche propaganda would have you believe.Also the expectations of Porsche buyers (old 911s and 968s) is ridiculous, they expect 20 to 30 year old cars to be as good as new. The garage owner (a very well respected Indy) I bought my 911 from agrees with me as well. Most are just garage queens and seen as an investment, not a car to drive. I will never buy another Porsche, my heart lies with flawed Alfas."
Paul S147 GTA,hi yes i agree on porsche parts — and many 911’s being garage queensmy experience with porsche tho - and going back to the 1980’s ( yes i’m that old ) is very good -of course cars have had faults but fixed in decent time with no further issues — i also use a V good indie porsche garage with no complaints— just wish i could find a good Alfa indie in glasgowbut to Porsche’s credit they have a huge dealer network with a very professional management backup and that to my mind is where Alfa fail massively — down to a lack of proper investment by parent company such a shame for a truly memorable car companybut getting your £60k plus new car serviced and repaired by Vauxhall trainees is just not good enough in my book

Muz,"Monza Sport in Ashington. Top notch. Kevin is a very knowledgeable mechanic, helpful and friendly too. As is Keith the Service manager"
Paul S147 GTA,wish we had a good one in glasgow — there was one but the guy is close to retirement and just doing ‘any’ work nowi have Kw coilovers / eibach anti roll bars/ wizard manifolds / Q2 diff to fit to my 147 GTA but can’t find anywhere local / able that wants to do the job 😳
GVblue,"Bit too far for me in Derbyshire I'm afraid.I used to use Peak Alfa in Hope, eighteen miles away so could easily cycle home after dropping the car off.Unfortunately they have stopped doing general Alfa work to concentrate on preparing them for racing."
gogsygtv,"Agreed Paul, we are really lacking alternatives in the west of Scotland, I have lamented the same in the (rather quiet) Scottish section on here. McLennans in Edinburgh is a bit far as is CP up in Dundee although both have a good rep!"

metalgod23,"The biggest and worst common denominator in all this is ""Arnold Clarke"" - useless based on reports on this forum, most dealers further down the country, especially down south are quite competent. Turbo and wiring loom issues are NOT common on these cars and I have owned a Giulia 2.0 and now the 2.9V6 for a total of 5 years, part of a fairly large Quadrifoglio owners group in the UK and South East with probably 1 or 2 issues reported for turbo (fault with boost diverter solenoid wiring) or wiring loom (water ingress in Body Computer, known issue on some early cars), most issues are battery related. I understand you frustrations though."
Paul S147 GTA,"i have to totally agree with you on your opinion on Arnold Clark — simply theee most incompetent and uncaring dealership i have ever had the misfortune to deal with — i would never purchase a car that had to be serviced at any of their dealershipsbut i’m sorry , i have to disagree with you !!! turbo and wiring issues are very common on all QF models, yes wiring more so on earlier cars , but turbo / wastegate issues are still common on all models"
metalgod23,"Ok let me be more specific.Wiring issues - very few reports of entire wiring harness needing replacement. The main failure seems to be water ingress due to faulty HVAC Evaporator drain or the fresh air vent seal letting water in during heavy rain.Turbo issues - the way you describe it sounds far worse than it is. There have been rare turbo failures per se. The main mode of turbo issue is either due to the left bank turbo solenoid wiring loom being short and pulling on the yellow tabbed connector to the solenoid under turns and hard acceleration resulting in temporary unavailability of boost diversion on throttle let off. This causes a CEL. This is now a known issue on early cars, fixed by a longer wiring loom. On newer cars, the flexible accordion pipe on the air intake, again on the left bank , can rub against the solenoid connector located directly underneath which with time results in the tab loosening and loss of connection, same symptoms as the earlier scenario. This is not so common but can happen under certain conditions.The other turbo issue can be cause by disconnection of the vacuum line pipe to the pneumatic waste gate. This gives all the symptoms of loud exhaust note due to waste gate being left open under load , loss of boost pressure and CEL.BOTH of the above turbo related issues can be quite easily diagnosed by a competent technician, not something Arnold Clarke are blessed with. Some of the other dealerships are not that much better off and a few have struggled with diagnosing these as well with I suspect some perfectly fine turbos being replaced unnecessarily or the fix taking far too long due to incompetence.Mechanically the engine design is quite sound. Dealership competence not so much. Hope this gives you some context. I have owned a Giulia for the last 5 years and a few other Alfas for 12 years before that so I am aware of the issues, having access to official technical bulletins, workshop manuals also help."
stelviowner,"Seems to be a theme developing where the dealership support for owners is less than ideal. It is a real shame that this impression is gaining traction when what Alfa need is a solid dependable network to support their customers when trouble strikes. I have an Alfa Stelvio Milano which I am thoroughly pleased with and it is a delight to drive. The local dealers are kind of ok. If you need a non urgent problem solved or a service done they are fine but turn up with an immediate issue and ask for help, don't bother. local independents are way more helpful than Alfa dealers. They want the business and value the customers. Alfa are way too self important and treat their customers with indifference. Nobody will be more surprised that the self satisfied dealers when the whole nonsense comes crashing down and leaves them out in the cold when the Ex Alfa customers vote with their feet and invest their hard earned money in a different marque having been exposed to Alfa's lack of ability to care less,"

Fedz,"Is there anyone out there who has or is experiencing severe battery drain on their Alfa Romeo Stelvio. My car has been back to the Dealership where it was purchased to rectify a stop/start issue which was supposed to be resolved by replacing the existing battery with a new one. However, since the installation way back in September I have experienced low power situations culminating in a dead battery after car wasn’t used for 2 days!!. Raised again with Alfa and after inspection was told that problem was the volume button on central console not switching off properly which caused the drain. This was replaced but once again battery is virtually flat again!!. This is now really concerning as what happens when you go on holiday and return to car after 2 weeks a completely flat car!!. Anyone got any ideas?"
,
cue2,"I bought mine new three years ago , to the day , and it has covered 11,700 miles. It went flat through lack of use in lockdown so I called the Alfa number and a customer service van arrived in just over half and hour. The technician charged the car up and it’s been fine since. Have you ever left the audio on? I think earlier cars had a “sticky”vol. on/off button."
Mash1138,Had the same issue. Was a dead battery replaced under warranty and the sticky volume knob was the culprit. Has been fine since new battery.
Alfie155,I had the volume control knob replaced (as a precaution i think) when I had an EML and limp mode issue and dodgy alarm. Never had a flat battery but S/S seldom works despite charging with a CTEK. The HRW does work however.Bendy fuel flap not as bad as last winter strangely. Perhaps not as cold so far.
Mash1138,"Had the bendy fuel flap replaced 3 times, latest seems OK, touch wood."

It has been very cold here last night around -3c but I'm getting nervous.Next month it will be left at an airport for a week dont want to return to a dud battery.Its on the original battery and I know the car only did 1k miles in its second year before we bought it due to lockdown, its likely the battery may not have been maintained properly.Going to upgrade to 95Ah AGM."
Muz,Am I right in thinking that the Veloce comes with a 95AH battery. I can only see a 9 on the battery top
Navlet,My Giulia Veloce MY19 has an EFB think its 80 or 85Ah.
Deman77,This is fine. You can leave your car. It flattens out there and drains really slowly from those levels.I would only replace with AGM when your battery is dud. AGM will not prevent draining - it will just recover fine from excessive discharge.
Navlet,"The car isn't left for more than 2 or 3 days without being used so that's reassuring to know, especially as next month its being left at an airport for a week. I will see what the voltage is tomorrow morning.Appreciate a 95Ah AGM wont prevent draining but is better suited to deep cycling and when fully charged will have a higher starting point than the OEM battery."

I took the car to the dealer, and they said the battery is good, suppose it has a warranty due that must be 15k miles and my car is 13k, they did not want to change the battery and the stop/start is not working. they said all is ok, nothing to fix. I can't believe it they said that when the car is not working on the stop/start and why the battery dead like that."
RBaron,"If the battery is dead to the point of nothing at all works, then suspect either a hard fault so the battery is disconnected from the system (unlikely), or there is something that has not de-powered and has drained the battery (quite likely). What was the voltage across the ‘dead’ battery?In ALFAs, the stop/start is the first thing to be prevented from working if the battery is low on charge, followed quickly by the heated rear window."
c4rm0,Hi just picked up my 2018 Stelvio that was first registered in the UK on 18/12/2018 (Late 2018). I have a Oneplus 9 pro phone with Android auto installed and i connected a USB C to my phone and a USB A connector to the front USB port under the infotainment system. I didn't get anything pop up on my phone/infotainment screen about android auto. Is it the cable i am using ? or does my car not have android auto/apple car play ? I have seen conflicting info around the Stelvio 2018's and Android auto/Apple car play but with my car being registered so late in 2018 i would of expected it to have it. In the centre console i only have a single USB port with a AUX port
,
chichibabin,Sounds like you don't have Android auto. I use the port under the armrest but I'm pretty sure all front ports support AA.Sent from my Pixel 3 using Tapatalk
chichibabin,I have a usb-c port as well in the centre console..Sent from my Pixel 3 using Tapatalk
gogsygtv,"My understanding from prior research (also have a 2018 stelvio) is if you have a single usb and aux as below, you do not have carplay / android auto. The two usb unit shown sitting in the glove box area in the pic needs to be in there.If your media system software is version .056 or higher it is possible to replace this part and have it operate, see the following guide:DIY USB hub installation for AA/CarplayIMPORTANT: Please read the whole thread as they are some important changes that might have to be done to the proxy settings.

Since then, it doesn’t do anything (other than tell me I still have a full tank which I haven’t any more!).I think I’ll leva sit until service is due. It takes forever to get it booked in and I can’t say the app does much that’s important anyway."
Twedds,My Alfa Connect recommends that I book my Stelvio in for a routine service despite it having been serviced in December.The warning appeared on the vehicles first birthday. Is this a common issue and is there a quick remedy?
pocholin,"How useful is the app?In my previous Volvo I could locate the car, it would let me know if a window was open and which , including the roof top and roll windows up.

welshboyo,"My Alfa Connect also says I need a service despite it being serviced in November as per the schedule. The in-car service information is correct however, properly displaying the number of miles until the next service.

Hatchet,Is it normal to get a brake pad sensor come on after 15k? Not driven hard...I felt them start to vibrate a touch so maybe they got uneven wear 👍
,
cue2,"Front , rear or both?"
pocholin,"Just to give you some context on other brands, I changed the rear pads in my previous car a Volvo V90 at 21k miles because the adaptive cruise control uses the rears to brake, being a heavy car, those wear faster than front ones. In fact I replaced all four just to have a different brand that didn't put as much brake dust (Porterfield), the fronts still had about half life left.From your description it sounds like it is the front ones, which would seem a little premature but not unheard off. Have you taken the wheels off and looked at them? How many mm do they have left? Make sure to look at the outer and inner pads."
Deman77,Vibration could be many things even if it happens under braking. Were you told your pads are worn off.? What is the discs condition?Is it QV or regular?
Gwegm,15k is ridiculous. They're only 85.79 on Euro car parts
cue2,Has the car been regularly used?
Muz,My heart sank when I saw the thread title…..I thought that was the bill for REPLACEMENT pads
cue2,"I bought new rear pads and discs for less than 15k when the MOT mentioned the pitting and Alfa U.K. refused to help. They did replace the entire front central armrest (cost £400+) when a rubber bump stop disappeared, at the first service but not the brake discs and pads two years later for less."

wictod,"Hi All,Don't know whether it's just LBC in the M25 area but the DAB radio channel for this station keeps dropping out every minute or so for a second or two? Tried another station X Radio and that appeared fine but haven't really tested it.. Guess I'll just use their FM station if I have to... Never really listened to radio in the car but I find i'm more composed and calm in the Stelvio as opposed to the nutter I was in the GTV.cheers"
,
Alfie155,I trend to use FM for LBC.Yesterday I was listening to Planet Rock on DAB driving on the A3. The more rural the location the more the signal dropped and Talk Radio was even worse. I still prefer FM for reception and clarity.
paultrim,"It does the same in my Giulia, it doesnt matter which station I could be listening too. My previous 3 series had DAB and only used to drop out occasionaly, I'm guessing its to do with a crappy digital antena fitted to the Alfa."
wictod,"Ah thanks guys, not just me thenI'll go back to FM for that station then.."
Otto52,"In my view DAB is a waste of time in a car due to the very poor coverage. At least with FM in a poor signal area you still get something even if it's noisy. The DAB in my Giulietta here in the Yorkshire Dales is hopeless, and there are even parts of the M1 where it doesn't work. Maybe it's the known aerial issue, I don't know, but I'm not prepared to throw money at it because the system isn't worth it."
SteveeGee,"I find DaB coverage is fine, but there is a problem with the implementation in the Stelvio.I asked the dealer to check at service but there is no known fix or update. Personally I think it is a software issue, where the head unit recieves competing frequencies for the same Station at different intensity or strength and it swaps between them because the software doesn’t have a big enough deadband to stop it."
BigFatJeff,"SteveeGee – I have a similar issue (I think). 2021 Stelvio, software version is 119.001.009. With one radio station (Virgin), I lose reception for a second or two, certainly in a number of locations, but can switch to a different station (any of the Heart stations) and it is fine with 100% playback all day long. I have driven my wife’s MG in the same locations with no drop out at all on either of the stations. If you are correct, I think I am left with two options – put up with it or change radio stations?Have I understood your points correctly, are there any other choices I may have?"
wictod,From my experience I think SteveeGee is correct.. I swapped from LBC to Talk Radio and don't get any dropouts in DAB for that station.
Muz,"I have only noticed the drop out on Talk Sport, which is rubbish anyway"

,
Muz,"It’s a small one, about £250 from a main dealer? Basically just an oil and filter change so quite steep imo.I bought mine at a year old, with the first service included, and got a service plan for the next three years including the big fourth service at about £650 which I think was an absolute bargain"
VeloceRosso,I think I was quoted £275 for mine but I ended up buying a service plan for which covered that and the next one (which I think was much more expensive) so seemed better value.
SimpsonTide985,I went to check out a Stelvio QV at the dealer the other day and saw that there was a large crack on the carbon fiber trim on the driver side doorHas anyone dealt with something like this? Is it something that is easy to fix/replace and re-install?(The photo is for reference only for where it would be. Not the actual car)
,
Deman77,It was mentioned before. It’s not common. It would cost you a fortune out of pocket for real cf trim (smth like 300 notes I would think for that panel and may be even more with OEM premium). It should get fixed under warranty. Stelvios don’t crash anywhere near as often as giulias so you will not have much luck from scrapyards.The trouble is it is likely a dodgy batch of panels so others may be heading the same way soon. So I would only accept it if they fix under warranty and give you 12m warranty on remaining panels. But if you can talk them out of a couple of grand just for this risk then it may be worth rolling the dice.
Steve Hop,"Cracks in carbon parts can normally be repaired, depending on how bad it is, but it’s very time consuming & expensive to boot. It’s a specialist job, if you want a good repair & top finish.You’ve been warned 😁"
don.norchi,"It does take time, common sense and some patience to repair damaged carbon fibre.... however, for under £150 you can get sufficient of all materials to repair quite a lot. The materials that I bought to repair a badly damaged front spoiler to a good standard would likely do another two. If the component is cracked as long as you can work the weave back you will not notice the repair once the resin has been painted on and carefully polished to a good finish...."
cue2,The appearance of an interior decor piece is probably more difficult to acheive than a functional spoiler under the front of the car?
Steve Hop,"Can’t say I’ve ever repaired a damaged part myself, but have done a lot of carbon skinning on OE parts over the years. It’s like most things, practice makes perfect. I totally cocked up the first few attempts!! But mastered it over the months & years.Like I said though, a lot of work!."
Zyp,"I know this has been covered before, but there’s currently a discussion in one of the QV FB groups.Seems a few people have been told by their dealer that the extended service plan does not cover the big year 4 service?Ive been told it does, so does anyone have the definitive answer?"
,

bobbybox,That could be it. Although the stalk of the bolt (the threaded bit) is still in place. I had thought that it was a large flat nut that screws onto it. But maybe it sheared off when they tried to remove the trim and i need to spray some WD40 and try and loosen it to see if it comes out...BB

ZAR939,"Nice work, for sure a better sound, but to be honest: the air is sucked in at one of the hottest spots in the engine bay. That may lead to a significant loss of power. This way you trade in sound for performance. Find a way to get cool air to the filters and it would be perfect"
alfaitalia,yes....and reducing the filtering ability from the original paper filters can only be good for the engine too....Oh hang on a moment.......
ZAR939,"What I am wondering about, are there any off the shelf induction kits offered for the QVs? And how do they cope with the heat issue?At last it is a matter of personal preferences regarding the engine sound, not performance. Alfa has invested 5 Billion € to develop the Giulia/Stelvio platform, the engine was constructed in cooperation with Ferrari. I think they found a decent way to aspirate the engine, any change is a drawback in performance, imho. But I would like to hear the sound, must be gorgeous. Sound file, plz"

Also the stock filter can flow more air than the motor will ever need even at max revs....so even if yours could flow more there will be no gain due to that. Its not the 80s with old school restrictive airboxes and filters. A quick google will show that most claimed power increases with CAI are bogus with many actually losing power.....unlike the poor filtration from cotton filters....which is very much fact!!Debunking the K&N Myth - Why OEM is BetterBefore spending your money on an aftermarket intake, let's debunk the misleading incomplete info about filtering and horsepower in the sales literature.www.nicoclub.com"
ZAR939,"That's why professionals clean out their cotton filters after each trackday...I live in the part of Germany that was hit by the catastrophic floods last summer. I've learned 3 things: Never listen to fire- or policemen under such circumstances - they will send you into mayhem. 2nd: Surprisingly a Brera can deal with 2 ft.+ of water. And: a paperfilter is likely to collapse when wet, luckily mine didn't, it was only heavily deformed.After that I considered using a Pipercross filter. But test results like the one above and assuming that floods of the century presumably only occur once in a century kept me from doing it... So under certain circumstances cotton filters make sense"
pocholin,"Well, they're not different than mine functionally...just a lot more beautiful with the carbon fiber pipe.You're right that K&N air filters used to make more of a difference in the performance...even in the early 2000s, when naturally aspirated engines were the dominant type...however, even if they don't flow more...and they are 2.5% less efficient than paper filters at cleaning (as the link you sent states), they don't have to be replaced as often (based on my experience) and still do a good job (based on the article you sent).I've been using K&N in every car I've had since the 90s (Chevy, Benz, Lincoln, Nissan, BMW, Volvo, Alfa), I've never had an issue and I've only used one per vehicle (usually ~100k miles of use during my ownership (the Nissan & Lincoln were the exception with 200k & 170k miles respectively...for me that is reason enough to swap filters...and if I gain any power that is an added bonus.That said, there is a certain amount of heat soak from launch until 25-30 MPH, that's for sure...mine or aftermarket offerings, once the car is moving, there's so much cold air coming in that it shouldn't make a difference.

Jambo,"Morning - I've noticed this for a wihle but not paid too much attention, however last night i had more time to look a bit more.I had a 2017 2.0 280 for some years and never noticed this.But with my QV, it feels like the clutch is almost slamming onto the transmission (rising slightly too high?) when comming out of Park into Drive.I've noticed this also moving into Reverse.I'm no mechanic, pehaps there is a software correction needed, as i'm sure its not wire cables any more that need adjusting?When i'm on a flat - its noticed by the car immediately wanting to pull away, and with reasonable want to, so am quite sure with the break peddle.However when on a slope (not massive - but reasonable) there is a noticeable clunk under the bonnet and the car is shaken forwards.I doesn't sound nice, and ismaking me wince more and more.All then is ok untill i release the footbrake and off we go.I more than likely need to get it into the garage as any clanking noise should not be there. (its just over 6 months from new)Has anyone had the same or any thoughts as to what it may be / how serious?Thanks for any ideas"
,
johnnyroper,If it’s only 6 months old take it back to the dealer to investigate
Deman77,There is no clutch in the torque converter. Clunking does not sound good.Where QV will be different from others in pulling away is release of the handbrake. QV has dedicated handbrakes on rear wheels and others rely on foot brake pads. So when you are pulling away from parked or when it auto engages on the slopes you would hear a release sound when you pull away - from rear wheels. From what you described “under the bonnet” it sounds like something different.
Jambo,"thanks - yes, i can release the handbrake fine - its solely from park to drive when hearing the issue on a slope onlyits booked in a week on monday"
pocholin,"On the slope, you might want to just release the brake pedal, wait about a full second or second and a half to see if the car smoothly starts moving forward. I've noticed that the handoff is not smooth from being on the brake pedal to accelerator...only when I do as described above, which means I always have to give it time to let go."
Jambo,"i‘ve noticed that if I put the car into Neutral before Park and then engage Drive that the problem does not happen… booked into the dealer anyhow a week on Mondaythe geolocation battery is already giving a service note a couple of weeks back, so good to clear thatinterestingly, or not!, the Alfa connect app stopped telling me that I had a service note after I had booked in. I’m sure it’s not that clever though, it pretty basic otherwise and lucky to work normallyDrove lovely today though, the wife commented “one of those journeys then!” About 2 minutes in, so was in trouble quick! And Italy beat wales so my punt at 40 to 1 came in. Should have put more than 2 pounds down."
Jambo,"So i'm told the shudder that i get shifting from Park to Drive is normal and a characteristic of the car.The shudder happens when there is some tension in the gear box (pull away slightly on an incline) and then you stop on the brakes and go to Park.When you next engage Drive the car will shudder/shake. Its not smooth.However, if you engage Neutral before park it will shudder at all. Completely seemless.Mechanically, it does not feel very sympathetic, and surprised the car (software?) does not enact neutral for you in this common case and remove the tension.For now i will stay in the habbit of selecting neutral before park.Has anyone else noticed this... or can recreate?(I didn't notice it on my previous 2.0 280, just this new QV)"

Deman77,"I do not get shudder other on engaging drive or releasing hill hold. I get a minimal shunt(more the sound than the movement) on uphill when the torque makes the hand brake release and the car moves forward, but never a shudder and never anything that feels mechanically unkind to the car.The only time the car feels odd and vibrates unpleasantly is when the 3cyl mode engages in N and D off power on low revs - sounds and feels a bit like you are labouring uphill in too high a gear. But that is definitely normal and mild and you need to know what to listen for. So if what you are feeling is more annoying than that I would keep looking."

Bazzerpl,"Hi, I'm curious to know if other Stevio Quad owners were told that the oil and oil filters should be changed after the first 2000km and not to use Racing mode before that."
,
Deman77,"Different schools of thought on run in procedure - from high heat cycle right away like in the bikes to the very conservative one as specified in the manual where you only start maxing out at around 500 miles. They do not have different run in procedure in the manual for QV or others which means it is unlikely there is anything in the engine that requires conservative run in. I started using mine fully after 100mile run from the dealer on the motorway.It’s a good practice to have run in oil change on any high performance engine at around 1-2k. There is no requirement in the manual, but lots of people do. I did mine. Put it like this - it will not hurt. If you can afford it - do it. It will make your car that little bit more desirable come resell time if there is a run in oil change stamp in the service book. Signals that you look after the car.Two things and this applies over life of the car: do not cold idle the engine - make sure you can drive away as soon after the start as you can. Do not go past 3k rpm until you get 3bars on the engine temperature gauge."

I don't know enough about the new brake systems, but what you describe would be easy to recreate in a conventional system by pumping the brake pedal with the engine off, no servo assistance etc. eventually the pedal would go hard and then you probably can't make the switch on the brake pedal to allow a start.

This didn't work so I took it back again on warranty. They fixed the dragging and replaced the pads when I said they'd obviously worn excessively for the first months.

To go through a rear brake pad in 9,000 miles is not right no matter how you drive it. Did they diagnose the cause of the early wear of the pad? Unfortunately, you might need to have a chat with Alfa UK to get this sorted if the dealer will not help."
cue2,Luckily I didn't have to negotiate with Alfa UK about the sticky calipers on my Giulietta but as Adamcot says you may well have to call them.
drmikeritchie,"FolksThanks for the responses. My local garage, who I've dealt with for years agrees with what you say - likely a sticky calliper. Unfortunately they're not the franchised dealer here, I have to deal with Arnold Clark. Their argument was consistently wear and tear, regardless of the unevenness - they blame Alfa Warranty for decision. When I talk to Alfa Care, they blame Arnold Clark as they are their 'eyes and ears on the ground' and they could not diagnose a fault. (I suspect its a case of computer says no). Where you've suggested calling Alfa UK - is that the customer care number in the handbook, or do you mean calling the UK Head office in Slough? I can't find a contact number for Slough."
cue2,"There's an international number;""UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE NUMBERYou can call Alfa Romeo using the Telephone Number 00 800 2532 0000 from the major European countries*.Use our rapid dialling system - on your phone key 00800 Alfa 0000.*Remember to check the costs of the call if you call from abroad or from a mobile phone.""From the website."
Spider95,"Certainly sounds like a sticking caliper - no doubt it was the inner pad that has worn down. As mentioned you need to escalate to Alfa Romeo direct to get this sorted.Putting aside for a moment the issue of the poor reputation of Arnold Clark, there is an underlying reason why dealerships can sometimes be reluctant to go the warranty route. They are simply paid less than the full retail rate. This is done by the following way:1) The labour rate charged back to AlfaCare is significantly lower than the full retail rate.2) Loading on parts prices (which can be substantial) is not allowed. Only the internal base cost is charged.3) Payment is not immediate from AlfaCare to the dealership. Lots of red tape, internal invoices, 30 days payment terms etc.So the difference Arnold Clark have charged you for the brake repair will be significantly higher than the payment they will receive from AlfaCare.That's how it works. Some dealers are fine with it, some are not. Clearly Arnold Clark are playing the game to their advantage, and not yours. Only a directive from Alfa HQ via a case raised will sort this out."

adamcot,I find it crazy that the customer has to get involved to make this happen. It just shows the massive disconnect between Alfa Romeo dealers and Alfa Romeo UK. Maybe it's the years of selling cheap(er) hatchbacks - not true premium vehicles. Customer's expectations are much higher than this.
hbv,I do not know whether the problems at the back brakes of my Stelvio was the same. After approx. 11000K / 10 monthsthe back discs had heavy. My dealer changed them including the pads - both on guarantee including a service car.He told me that he can do that within the first 12 months. Anyway I would not accept any payment as such a defect is not influenced by the driver.
hbv,heavy scratches.... Sorry
ssv,"to elaborate on my post yesterday.... as was case with hbv, both my rear discs were corroded at both brake pads worn out and had to be replaced."
Hugh Myles,"Exact same situation as Giulia. Corrosion on the discs, and brake pads wearing far too quickly. There is/was a batch of brake discs causing this, all other Stelvio owners should check their rear discs for pitting and scoring on the surfaces' then get onto your dealer. Do not pay for the work, it is a warranty job all the way. They did the same with Giulia owners, some dealers did it under warranty, some didn't. Ring Alfa if in doubt, but only after the dealer has inspected them. There is a long thread on the Giulia forum on the issue."

The disc was red hot where the calliper had blatantly stuck on, but they wanted her to pay for that, saying brake pads/discs weren't a warranty item - even though the wear was caused by a faulty calliper which was a warranty itemI can't remember what happened in the end, think we got them changed outside the dealer network as the Alfa dealer took the mickey on the quote for replacing them just to add insult to injury. Alfa were ordered by the Financial Ombudsman to have the car back in the end as so many things went wrong with it, but most of it would've been made a lot more bearable if the dealer and Alfa UK had known its ar*e from its elbow. One guy in Italy was very good but that's where the competence ended and it doesn't seem massively different now"
OFA018,"I had same situation on my Stelvio with rear brake pads after 15 000 km, left rear inner pad was worn out almost tho the end. I replace pads and check for sticky caliper but found nothing wrong :grumpy:I don't use cruise control at all , and use breaks in same way as in my Giulietta. On Giulietta with 90K still original set of pads. 330 mm bremboSo , what can lead to abnormal pads wear ?"
ChrisBrearley,In a similar situation here. Stelvio just gone in for it's second year service at 16k miles and the health check has come back saying rear discs are excessively pitted - front discs are fine. Surely there is a problem here? 16k miles seems far too soon.
Hugh Myles,"Same problem with Giulia's.Rear brake pad wearHi all, took my girl into get a nuisance check engine light looked at and during the vehicle health check they noted that the rear pads are 50% worn.

I would also expect the...www.alfaowner.comGiulia Veloce - check your rear brake discsI’ve just changed my rear pads but had to replace the rear discs as they were completely rusty and shot on the inside.

ChrisBrearley,Thanks Hugh. Seems like it should be covered under warranty. It is Arnold Clarke though so I expect a fight 🙄
Hugh Myles,Roll up those sleeves and go in swinging....... Its a safety issue.
drmikeritchie,"Hi allI'm new here and need some advice. My Stelvio was at the Dealership a couple of weeks ago to have the brakes looked at. One rear brake pad totally worn out - its only 9 months old and 9,000 miles. Other three rear brake pads worn but plenty life left in them. Alfa and dealership refusing to cover under warranty - they say wear and tear. Had to pay bill to get car back. Any advice on getting them to see sense - this uneven/ aggressive wear is definitely wrong. Has anyone had any joy at getting this sort of thing covered under warranty?ThanksMike"

SickStu,"Just suffered same problem - rear discs & pads gone at ~11k miles, fronts fine. Because of covid lockdowns / me being retired it's taken 2 and a bit years to get to 11k so despite having a five year warranty dealer said ""not covered"". After a month of debating with Alfa Care they offered to pay for the discs and 50% of the pads leaving me a bill of ~£280 for half the pads and the labour. Not very happy, just wanted to vent."
cue2,"You did better than me then. On the first MOT there was an advisory on pitted discs but although it‘d covered only 12,000 miles it was too late and I was not offered any contribution. I was initially by one lady at customer services then the next lady said NO."
Muz,Is this something you can see just by looking at the pads or running your finger across the disc? Obviously the pads would be harder to check without the wheel off?Anyone got photos of theirs when they needed replacing?
SickStu,Here's one of mine (before):-

Starfishy,"Drove my Stelvio to work this morning - no problems.Go to start my car after work - panic!! Everything flashes - warning lights, headlights you name it. Car won't start.So, I call a breakdown service. He arrives, hooks up his battery doohickey and announces that my battery is dead. After a few minutes, he starts the car and everything works perfectly.I hadn't left anything turned on, plugged in or otherwise engaged.I drove to the garage where I bought it from, with the attentive breakdown man following me, and left it there.They'll get back to me after doing a few tests.From what I've read, this isn't an unknown problem??"
,
wictod,It's definitely a known issue but the root cause appears to be elusive.. what drains it down is a mystery.. there's talk of the radio / info screen button being a bit sticky and not turning off?
Starfishy,"I've no idea. Everything appeared to be off when I got out of the car, but it's difficult to say if the screens are dark.I shall wait and see what they say.In any case, I'm looking forward to giving them back the Twingo they lent me. It was very nice of them, but compared to my Stelvio...."
cue2,I reckon it’s possible to leave the radio on. There were some radio volume/onoff controls replaced because they were “sticky” but mine went flat through total lack of use during a lockdown and the power tailgate took the last remaining bit of power so it couldn’t start. No crazy warning light display but a very prompt visit from a customer services man in his van fixed it.
Starfishy,Ah ha! I shall certainly bring up that point with the garage.Thanks.
Starfishy,"Finally, no great mystery. They changed the battery.So, fingers crossed 🤞it was only that."
wictod,I assume it was tested as faulty? what battery did they fit.. hope it sorts it out
Pandra,"Just been through this with Alfa. Changed the original (4 yr old) battery after indications it was struggling. Standard 'fix all' response, blame the battery. Subsequently I performed parasitic draw tests and found that the alarm system, when activated, causes an erratic draw spiking up to 200ma. For reference, normal draw across the industry would not normally exceed 50ma. Mine was 10ma without the alarm set.So, having a third party warranty, I took it to Alfa as I suspected a fault-- parasitic draw from the alarm system. After testing, the tech informed me that this is normal across the Stelvio and Giulia ranges. But not the other models. He said he was just as surprised when he started working for Alfa as he had never seen it before, but confirmed with Alfa that it was correct. He also confirmed that as a result they have no end of electrical issues with Giulia and Stelvio and generally just change a lot of batteries.Fitting the larger battery won't necessarily help as it should be paired with the uprated alternator to cope with it's charging requirements. If you're mainly doing longer trips you'd probably be okay with the standard alternator."
Starfishy,"Don't know - I did ask, but the guy who gave me back the car wasn't the one who did the work. Keeping my fingers crossed!"
Starfishy,"Well, as our nearest Alfa garage is 70kms away, I suspect I'm going to be doing a lot of driving. Or someone is - I have a 24 month guarantee offered by the garage when I bought the car (which is a Renault garage) that basically covers everything except war.Watch this space...."
Isotope,"I woke up to a flat battery a couple of weekends ago and I think it was down to something stopping the powergate from completely closing? Pesky Umbrellas! The night before I noticed the centre console switch lights seemed to be illuminated for a long time but didn't realise they should shut down after about 30 seconds, hindsight is a wonderful thing and now when I lock the car I try amd wait to see if the switch illumination shuts down. I have just about got back to locking and walking away again as I was before the flat battery episode.Thought I'd add, flat battery, open car with blade in fob, open bonnet connect battery to terminals under bonnet and then you should be able to power open the boot, I tried charging the battery for about 4 hours using my Alfa charger but had to jump start using the terminals under the bonnet. Remember don't connect any thing to your battery negative poles on either your's or the donor car. I used the 500x to start the Stelvio and it also has an IBS so I used the battery tray retaining bolt on the 500X to get a good negative."
alfaitalia,You don't need a bigger alternator just because you have a bigger battery. The battery is just the reserve 12v power source for starting and when the alternator cant keep up with electrical demand. The alt will still only need to put as much into the battery as required to keep it topped up....just the same as if it was a small battery. Sure it will take longer to charge from flat....but that's it. I have the biggest battery that will fit in the tray on my 159....the alternator keeps it full no problem. The only time you might need a bigger alternator is if you put higher demand on the 12v system when driving.......like a big sound system or lots of old school high power lighting.I could not start my car after about 10 days non use with the old battery....but my big AGM one starts her cleanly after about 3 weeks. Unless you worry about every last kilo you cant have too big a battery!
Pandra,"Maybe should have clarified; that info came from current Alfa trained tech.Myself, I just fitted the upgrade AGM battery…..🤣"
Autopilot99,HI - I live in Australia has anyone looked into the depreciation rate of a new Stelvio .Which model is the better buy for holding its value ?Do exterior colours and interior colour make a big difference as well ?Any information is appreciated .
,
cue2,I’d imagine trends will differ from market to market but the recent chip crisis and its adjustment to supply has helped values everywhere.
StelvioAlfie,"Not sure about your market but I would imagine that most costly brand , QV, would see the most drastic depreciation in the begging of the years as we see with most higher end cars. 2.0 seems to hold its value relatively well in my market (meaning depreciating at about the same rate with other cars). I think it comes down to what you would prefer to drive."
nannini,I bought my Stelvio Veloce 2.2 last Feb and its worth more now than last year due to uk second-hand prices going upthink colours and spec make a difference like with any car and also there are less options available on the brand new ones
Twedds,I hope that remains the case as I may change my 2.2 Veloce this year if I get the job I want. If successful then my annual mileage will reduce to within QV territory!Although I’ve been hankering after an Alpine A110 for sometime…
Muz,If I could justify it I’d trade my Stelvio in tomorrow to get into an Alpine A110. Fabulous car
alfaitalia,I know Ill be in the minority but sorry I think they are pig ugly!!
metalgod23,"The QV I bought nearly 2 years ago will fetch the same or more than what I paid for it back then, despite adding 12k miles! It is all about supply and demand."

TheGrimJeeper,Pointless.(Do you think the approach and departure angles have been compromised?)
GVblue,
Muz,I quite like the look but it’s a step too far for me to consider one
SGG,bodykit reminds me of this:
cue2,That’s an insult to the Ford designers.
alfaitalia,Having seen the video I don't dislike it as much as I did after seeing the initial photo....it does look pretty much factory build quality too. I'm not sure if that's really a compliment or not!!!
manc350,"I don't get it.. lower an SUV.. and make it wider.. why just why ?it is not quite as ugly as this, (i am pretty sure the Cayenne hit every branch of the ugly tree and face planted at the base..), but still why just why ??"
Per1,"The beauty of the Stelvio Quadrifoglio is that it is understated and really quite subtle - it doesn't have a ton of badges and labelling all over the boot, and simply leaves a subtle Q4 and Stelvio name, and even more subtle Quadrifoglio badges on the front wings. Adding the body kit wrecks the subtlety of the car. Not for me. Subtle is the preference"
alfaitalia,I can see that point of view.....but I also like individually to be expressed through cars.....very boring world with no modded cars.
cue2,Modded as a cheap means of repairing a crashed example. That’s how it looks in many cases.
manc350,"Sorry but I see modding an SUV as increasing ground clearance, increasing suspension articulation, more apt tyres / wheels, rock crawlers, engine sump guards etc, water safe air intakes and electrical protection for wading... ... not turning it into an Alderley edge high street creeping piece of plastic enhanced crap that looks like something a teen boy might want to photograph for his insta...So this would be an appropriately modded 4x4 / SUV -or this -"
Deman77,"I guess the question is whether you are modding the U or the S part of the SUV.isn’t it funny how the journos have separated two door coupes into sports car, super car, GT and treats them all as separate classes. The differences would be just engine power, suspension rigidity. All could go on track or road and cannot go over a deep puddle. They go discussing them like they are worlds apart.Whilst anything raised more than certain amount off the ground is flippantly called SUV - be it Nissan Patrol, Range Rover or Stelvio QV."
StelvioAlfie,Most of the SUV never leaves the pavement so driving a suv is pointless most time. This is probably the reason why the suvs are assimilating sedans. You have to admit that it does look different and also attractive but I'm biased. Lowering the SUV makes no sense to me also but it does add to the handling as the width of the car does.Don't hate. They are beautifulShould have parked the car next to the ranger to make the choise easier

wictod,The only benefit I can see in lowering a Stelvio is it would be marginally easier to get my tools in the boot..
alfaitalia,"Done properly it should improve the handling, lower centre of gravity, less roll etc etc.....but then if you worry about that sort of thing with a Stelvio you probably bought the wrong car."
cue2,And you’ve driven a Stelvio@alfaitalia?
alfaitalia,Yes we have had this conversation before....Im not saying it handles poorly or anything...or insulting Stelvio owners........but a lower stiffer car with a lower CofG (lets say like a Giulia!)....should logically handle better. But as said....you bought the wrong car if you drive at 10 tenths enough of the time to feel the need to lower it. Although I suspect the above car was lowered for cosmetic reasons as much as anything else.
cue2,"You could just get a worse handling car if you want 10 10ths driving. My 147Q2 felt faster than the Giulietta that followed it. The Stelvio is probably faster than that Giulietta, especially on country roads where you can see ahead a bit better. It could post the Quattroruote video comparing the Stelvio Quadrifoglio with the Giulia but you probably wouldn’t watch it."

Deman77,"You simply cannot take the liberties with giulia QV you can get away with with Stelvio qv on the real world roads were you can have a new bump around the bend, some loose material on the surface or a puddle around a blind corner.That is not to say it is not fun on the public roads. I know Stelvio qv is even fun at 6/10 so I’m sure giulia is fine at 8/10 which is probably the maximum any sane person should do. You simply cannot take it to 9/10 on every outing in any weather unless you are a gambler.So, low centre of gravity or not, unless your fun is to be had at regular track visits or you have brilliantly surfaced nsp low traffic twisties near you, you are not getting your money’s worth out of giulia qv. You need very little talent and self restraint to enjoy Stelvio qv to the full and it begs to be pushed. If giulia has that same urge permeating it I would be really frustrated at only being able to do it in the right conditions or on track and holding back all the time.I agree no point lowering Stelvio unless you can do it right (a lot more than just springs) as for marginally better look you are interfering with Ferrari tuned geometry that was good for the n-ring record and reducing the comfort for family use that is just about ok stock. Also pimping up a good looking but understated Q car like this would not be my choice. May be that’s why that deranged car sat on auto trader for ages."
bobbybox,"Hi there,New to this forum and already finding it a mine of really useful info now that I am the proud owner of a Milano Edition 280 petrol Stelvio.On my V5 it says that it was registered at the end of Jan 2019 so I'm assuming its a MY2019 example. However, I cannot find the actual build date anywhere. The VIN plate on the inside of the passenger door only has VIN, engine serial no, paint code and weights etc. No mention of build date (e.g. MDH).How do I find this out? can you decode it from the VIN? if so how.

bobbybox,Turns out it was built on 18/12/2019. I was ordering mapcare and asked the parts guy...Does that make it a MY19 car?BB
Deman77,Think they switch to next my around that time but since next would be my20 facelift you can tell easily by whether you have touchscreen and new look infotainment or dark rear lights and dark Stelvio script on the boot door and dark scudetto surround.

finalfisti,"Hi guys,Happy 159 owner since many years, who now due to 2 kids and a high-mileage 159 is starting to look for a replacement. I did not consider myself to be a SUV person but after having given it a thorough thought I'd like to consider it even more seriously. Buying second hand, probably a 2018/2019 model.One question though: I live in Switzerland and it seems like all or at least most Stelvios around here are sold without roof bars, and I'm an avid roof box user, meaning that I'd need to install my Thule wingbars right on the roof with adapters (as currently done on my 159 saloon without roof bars) - unless one can install OEM roofbars on an existing Stelvio?The glass roof look nice, could anybody provide me insights on the noise level of a glass roof? Bear in mind that I drive on the Autobahn and go up towards 180 km/h on a regular basis. Any issues? And how does the roof box get along with a glass roof (obviously cannot be operated, but can you at least install a ski box?).Many questions, but keeping my hopes up. Other alternatives to the Stelvio is either a Leon Cupra or a 530, neither of which I find as attractive as the Stelvio tbh.Your kind advice is much appreciated."
,
Deman77,"With The wing style crossbar a good box is whisper quiet up to 60mph but quite noticeable at 70mph (probably same noise as standard wind noise through b pillars ) even on my my20 with no glass roof you notice it.I think roof boxes or was it bars are rated up to 70-80mph. You need to get Porsche taycan ones which are wind tunnel tested and rated to higher speeds, but I suspect they are only Porsche fit.At those speeds the drag will be enormous and you will get aero effects so likely will be exceeding roof bar 70kg ratings. If you have been doing it already then you are probably ok with that - I doubt Stelvio structure is weaker than 159.I don’t know what ratings are for mounting points without roof bars.You can retrofit roof bars - I think configurator was allowing either factory fit or dealer fit bars. buy it requires lining lift etc. think someone on here did it."
Muz,"I have a glass roof, the light it lets in without the screen is a massive plus. With the roof opened the wind noise is unbearable at a constant speed. I very seldom open it unless I am bodding aroundCan’t help with roof box comments as I have never used one on the Stelvio"
cue2,We had an Audi A2 with the skyroof option and although it was very worthwhile the amount of warranty work we had back in 2001 still puts me off anything like that. There was a warning that the added 75 kg on the top of the A2 meant no roof box etc. The Stelvio Speciale has more hope of being stable though with a load on the top!
finalfisti,"Thanks guys for your kind answers. Is it possible to have a glass roof and roof bars? I really don't see any Stelvios with glass roof and roof bars. If I can't get an answer here I will ask at a dealer.I'm aware of the added risk with a sun roof, with leaks and unwanted openings etc... but I have a 2 and a 4 year old and putting them in the back with the tinted windows (seems standard here) won't be any fun for them to enjoy longer rides, which is why I'm interested in this option. As a/the (main) driver I will be looking forward anyways instead of up..."
Deman77,You almost certainly can get bars with sun roof or get them retrofitted into car with one. Until you started questioning I would not even think those could mutually exclusive.

Deman77,"my test drive had sunroof and it really lights up the interior - no question and Missus really wanted it because of that. I had to put the foot down based on how useless I found it in 5 years in xc90 and how hot it makes the interior in summer. and glad I did. This is the car with the most effective cooling I have ever had (my xc90 had two condensers and 5 zone a/c with 4 vents even in 3rd row. You just cannot fight solar gain through flimsy sunshade. and we are talking Essex here, not even that hot. On long journeys kids faces are stuck into the screens, on short they like to see carplay screen from the back the like to see music being played. Pretty sure sunroof will add glare and this is no iPad Pro screen quality. I have never sat in my car and thought: “well that’s a bit dark” like I was when nit picking during test drive. I just look forward, like you said. What I notice every time is nicely shaped steering wheel, chunky analogue dials with unlimited resolution, unlimited refresh rate and uncanny 3D effect - who would have thought you don’t need crazy expensive screen for that - just some old school stuff.I rode in the rear seat once and it really isn’t that dark looking out from there. The tint is good quality and not ott. I was really worried when I made that choice but never once regretted it.A chap on US forums alleges that steel roof is aluminised steel (aluminium plated instead of zinc). The main purpose of aluminised steel is heat efficiency - it has 95% infrared rejection.My kids (9 and 5) never commented they missed sunroof from the other car or ever mentioned it was dark there. Not Missus and she would always remind me if I insisted on something and got it wrong - perfect test this.unless you yourself are into sunroofs and happy to sit about 6in back of optimal driving position so it does not start behind your head, just skip it. If you are on the fence, choose car for other reasons and exclude sunroof from your decision tree."
Isotope,"I don't know the definitive answers to your question but I have been to Switzerland on many occaisions and the glass roof would be especially nice for the rear seat passengers to view the mountains without ducking under to look out of the front screen. If you are going to have a roof box pemanently fitted to the car I wouldn't bother with the glass roof. Here in dingy britain it is a really nice way of getting extra light into the car! I suppose this comes down to what you are used to, if you live by the seaside it's not a novelty every day to someone who lives in a town. Same thing for a Swiss man who sees mountains and snow every day! You pay your money and take you chance!! Love the sparkly roads in Switzerland they plough glass into the tarmac!!"
Pandra,"Held out for a pano roof as it really adds to the dynamic of the car, especially with a red and black. Cuts down on the acres of painted metal. No noticeable heat gain that the cooling couldn't handle, probably helped by the athermic glass in the Milano. Everyone who's travelled in the back has commented on the light and airy space compared to a conventional roof. I doubt they'll feel the need to comment every time though, would be a bit weird...No problem with roof rails, just order the right versions if retrofitting as shown above. Available in black or silver. Handbook simply states not to open it if rack or cross bars are fitted, or if there is snow or ice on it, much the same as any electric window. Worth every penny."

Leo159,"I have a Stelvio with pano roof and without roofrails; needed to fit a ski box, and decided to put a set of Thule clamps on the roof (specific model for stelvio of course) rather than retrofitting roof rails which would have been much more expensive as apparently it is quite an time-consuming operation, need to take down the ceiling covers etc.Since I mounted the clamps plus a wingbar+skibox I went to Austria twice for a total of 4000km, and I have absolutely no regrets about this solution, clamps are rocksolid on the roof and have not damaged it at all. Very happy with it"

I did take it to an Alfa Specialist when it first happened, they advised me that it was not true and sensor based which would be an expensive job, so I live with it.Hopefully the OP’s problem is similar"
alfaitalia,Hope its not the issue that the other 159 models suffer from (commonly the TBI and the 2.0 JTDm)....poor sealing between the oil pick up and the pump meaning air is sucked in.....mine had that issue.

No repetition of fault in the 5 months since so something they did fixed it. If someone else has the same fault outside of warranty, i suggest if your cam belt and water pump has not been replaced yet, do that with the work to fix the fault as this will hopefully lessen the financial pain overall.The Service Manager knew I would be interested so he printed off the parts used for me. The main thing they had to replace was some sort of filter that required taking the cam belt off. I’ve got in my head it was a sump filter but I could be wrong. Apparently the new one that they put on was modified / redesigned in 2019 - what does that tell you!Parts were about £1700 at the time (main dealer prices) and there were a lot of labour man hours - God knows how much that should have been. Outside of warranty though all in I reckon it would have cost me somewhere between £2.5k & £3k. Hope this helps anyone else in the future who needs it with all Part Numbers & quantities shown.

wictod,There's a few threads about this i've read... maybe you've seen them already regarding the pump sensor.. the fact it's not staying on is some comfort but anything like that I'd get it down the garage asap in case it's the pump.. hopefully it can be diagnosed with the software they have.. apparently it's difficult to get to the sensor.. good luck...

Starfishy,"I spent a few months looking for a recent, second-hand Guilia Q4, but most of them were too far from me. So, I started looking for Stelvios. Where I live, a very rural area in the centre of France, Stelvios are slightly (I stress the word, slightly) more prevalent than Guilas.You can imagine my surprise and delight when I found a RED Q4 AT8 Executive in a garage only 25km from me. With only 22 000km and loads of options, I snapped it up! The garage have been fantastic including in the price, car registration, 24-month comprehensive guarantee and 4 new tyres to be fitted by them when the present ones are on their way out.I'm also quite pleased that, bigger than the Guiletta I had before, it only took me 10 minutes to back it into our garage the day I brought it home!"

dzienj,"It is the day today where my stelvio decided to die.I was on my way to work in the morning, and noticed that I can't get the blower heater to full speed, it was bearly blowing air.Thought that's strange, but didn't pay too much attention - thought this will go away with the car restart.Took the car out again for lunch, started fine, blower bearly blowing again, so I thought - yeah, this migh be an issue.No error messages or anything on the dashAfter the lunch - packed myself up and the car didn't start. Christmas tree on the dash - specific for low battery issue.I called up someone with jump leads and we started the car, but also measured the voltages and found that it's very low ( 10 volts or so) with the car on, Reving isn't changing a thing and the voltage keeps dropping slowly.The conclusion is that the charging is gone, no messages on the dash suggesting any charging issues, all fuses OK, continuities checked.The obious would be the alternator - but how? Why no messages, no-charge lights on the dash? What the hell did just happen?The car is a 2017, 60k on the clock.Anyone experienced anything like this? Anything I might be missing, a magic fuse hidden somwehere?Wonder your thoughts?"
,
joephoto,"Even with a perfectly functioning alternator, the battery may be at the point where it simply can no longer hold a charge. It could possibly be the alternator, but I would first try a new battery."
dzienj,"Yeah, makes sense, but we managed to put a bit of charge on it with the jump leads and the other car running for some time - enought to drive the stelvio back to the works carpark.Why does a fault in the charging system not show up on the dash? It’s rather fundamental and to my knowledge - very standard. Is it a giulia/stelvio hidden feature not to have that warning?"
dzienj,"In addition - there is no alterator voltage on the battery at all with the car running, just the slowly dropping battery volts when measured on their terminals."
johnnyroper,"I assume it’s got smart charge system like most modern cars,if it’s anything like bmw systems unplugging the small wire on alternator puts it on to a static 14.2v output gives a fault code but might be worth a try to see if alternator kicks in."
jwq,I'm assuming the auxiliary belt is ok ?
Isotope,"I had something very similar on my 147JTD and Giulietta JTDM,in both cases the alternator proved to be the issue. Provided the car started the last thing that stopped working was the engine, even the headlights stopped working on the 147 but the engine got me home and then never started again. The Giulietta got me to work and jump start got me home and then never started again and I don't remember a charging warning light on either car. The diesel injectors only work at about 3Volts iirc so probably the last things to fail dependent on available battery voltage?"
dzienj,"I'll be starting with the battery.Got a smart charger and left it on the car overnight. Charged ""full"". When unplugged, the battery on the car measured arround 11.6V. Not too great but decided to commute in the car to work. Had a voltage meter hooked up to my 12V console socket and was monitoring it while going along.At no point I've seen any rise in the voltage, only a steady fall down. At around 10V this time, less than 15 minutes of drive with everything electric possible switched off, interesting things started happening. First was the iddle speed, went up to 1.5k, then the gearbox errors started showing up and the gearbox changed itself to neutral, I managed to put it to drive for few more seconds and pull over. When pulling, I noticed the power steering is going. The last voltage reading before I shut the engine was 9VGot the car back home with some help, now I'm thinking where to start.The battery is shot - no doubts about it, it shouldn't drain after 15 minutes of driving, even with no charge. I'll be changing it, now getting my head around what and where to buy - AGM , EFB ( this is what the car came with originally) - suggestions welcome on this point.The other issue is the charging itself - I had no clue it's such a sophiticated battery and charging management system - IBS, inteligent alternator... propably a lot of other godenessStarted with scanning the car - among a swept of errors, ""Inteligent Alternator"" glows nice and red, with a comment ""short circut to +V or open circut detected, Dashboard warning light was not activated for this fault""I think I'll start with the battery, see what happens and how it behaves. Maybe the extreme low voltages are causing the batery management sysems not being able to work correctly, not switching the charge on, although I doubt as this should be the first thing that should be engaged to recover from low voltage situation.The next would be the alternator itself I'm affraid"
Isotope,"What year is your car, I don't know the answer but Alfa fitted the security gateway on MY2018 cars iirc so you might be able to read errors but not reset them? JWQ help me on this?"

I had one snap on a Volvo a few years ago, I had no idea until the radio went off, A/C then power steering etc. With no belt to the alternator no charging of the battery, no idea how long I had been driving with no belt as there was no warning until battery died luckily it didnt do any damage."
dzienj,"Yeah - the belt is on and all working and rotating there.Just looked at some the photos I've taken when the timing was changed, to assess how much work is requried to get to the alternator.It appears quite accessible with the intake/air cooler bits removed."
epsonix,"my friend had that one way clutch on alternator broken and so no charging, 2.2d 2016 year ago."
dzienj,"Ever since my last post, I bought a new Varta battery, charged it fully and hooked it all up into the car. I monitored the car voltages and at no point there was any signs of alternator volts. The brand new and fully topped up battery was showing a bit over 12 volts after the first car startup, then gradually - over maybe ,2 hours of driving, iddling, reving etc, was down to 10V. At this point the low voltage message showed up on the dash.Sureley the system doesn't charge and the alternator would be the first call. I observed its works, thought that it's maybe the clutch/pulley on it, but i can see the inner fan spinning. I don't have any error messages in the ECU, no warnings that the charing isn't working - the MES errors I posted earlier cleared all and nothing is coming back. Big question is why. Something as stupid as indicator bulb, or USB port troubles will be brought to the drivers attention, but a critical charging system not? I'm a bit puzzled. It's now more a question of trusting my stelvio, and guilia that my wife is driving, going forward.I enquired with Alfa, it's 800/1200 GBP + VAT for a new alternator ( depending on the type), £ 120 for diagnosis, £250 for new alternator fitting ( two hours).They also claimed that never in their history of dealing with Giulia/stelvios, they had do change an alternator.I'll propably get this booked in.Does anyone have a repair manual detailing the Alternator change work?Thanks"
jwq,See:Guess it could also be a problem with the IBS sensor / connection
epsonix,"my friends 2.2 GIulia, when alternator clutch stopped working, was neither showing any charging errors, thats why first it was different diagnose and he also went for battery change. He bought one from used car for like EUR80, put it in, and car is good since. That guy does anually like 40kmiles, alternator died when car was 2 years on roads (he bought 2016 stock in 2018).I follow many forums and facebook groups Giulia/Stelvio daily, not a common issue, your is 2nd I hear over years, no worries, trust the car. Just your dealer prices, that sucks."

Video linked below"
johnnyroper,Can’t see videos but if you hold fan with screwdriver pulley should freewheel anti-clockwise but be locked clockwise. I did alternator this week that freewheeled both ways as the clutch was knackered

The prices in this trade have always been tremendous."

Deman77,Anyone did this? If so which dongle? Connectivity drops or lagging inputs? I would not do unless those are all but non-existent. Lots of unhappy reviews mainly support related but lots of happy ones as well. So seems like it either works or you are stuffed. Not sure if car specific.The annoying thing with wired CarPlay is forgetting the phone in the car when you are rushing out to let the kids out. I wish apple buzzed the watch when it detects you are getting out of your seat and asked if you want to bring your phone but in the absence of that I am thinking the wireless dongle.
,
Muz,I do that all the time (leave my phone in the car when connected or charging on the wireless charger)an alarm from the phone or car would be goodCan’t help with the dongle though.
Deman77,I submitted feature request to Apple. Shouldn’t be more than a few years.

cue2,What are Stelvio owners doing about carrying bikes?The roof seems a bit high to lift them onto. A towbar mounted carrier has to be best in many ways but what happens with the reversing camera/sensors?I've found it easy enough to get my sons bike to the track with the seats down and the boot flood turned upside down but I want to join him.

markiet,"Don’t own a Stelvio YET, but eith my CRV I found that a detachable tow bar worked the best. There’s a button that turned off the reversing sensor , not sure if that exists in the Stelvio or not. Just make sure you get a rack that that tilts so you can open the hatch easily ."
kgb,A friend of mine has the towbar bike carrier fitted to his 159 SW and it is the perfect solution. So I am thinking of doing the same to my Stelvio. It has an option for the parking sensors for towbar in the infotainment.
RicksAlfas,"When you connect the towbar electrics on a modern car, it ""should"" sort out the fog lights, reversing sensors etc. It will need coding to the car so check with the towbar people first that they can do it. When you unplug the towbar the car reverts to normal."
kgb,I am thinking of something more like this:???????????? ?? ?????? - PERUZZO Azarrono electrics and so on...less then 100euro.Have to find a good towbar as light as possible

The power socket rotates up to hide behind the bumper/rear tray and the tow hook itself hook is detachable and hooks into a socket which is again not visible.Very smart solution, I'll report back when I've got my new Bike rack - I'll prob stick with getting a Thule EasyFold 2 bike carrier. I've used their bike racks in the past and they have been solid.In case anyone has any other suggestions, I'm after something reasonably light, folds up for easy storage and tilts .I've used the roof box company mentioned above in the past and they were great."
cue2,Interesting.Did they charge the price on the link?And what happens with the reversing camera? Does it switch off when the tow bar is on?
nelo1110,Haven't got a Stelvio but assume it will take the Saris Gran Fondo which doesnt obscure the lights or plate on my Guilietta.See post below for photos.https://www.alfaowner.com/Forum/#/topics/1168317
mikesalfa,"Down here in NZ there are bike carrier racks which come with a set of lights on them, and you can also get another number plate with 'Supplementary' written on it to go on the bike rack. Not many people do, and most people's lights and number plates are covered up by the bikes, despite it being a legal requirement. Not sure what the legalities are where you live.As for the reversing camera turning on, does it really matter if it turns on? You don't have to look at the screen but having the ability to turn off he parking sensors would be good so it doesn't constantly beep."
aspender,It won't unfortunately (as the Gran Fondo is the best solution for bike carrying by far) I had to get rid of mine when I got the Stelvio. The angle between the rear screen and bodywork below it make it impossible. Also not sure the significant overhang of the boot spoiler would survive either.Instead I use Whispbar roof bars and Yakima Frontloader carriers. The roof isn't that high - getting bikes on and off is fine.
cue2,Those Saris things can do a lot of damage. I bought one years ago and never had the courage to use it. Think of that aluminium bodywork ...

cue2,I’m a bit too scared to put more than one carbon fibre bike inside the Stelvio. That’s one reason I chose the roof kit I’ve got which clamps the forks in place.If you turn the boot floor panel over you’ll protect the carpet.

Fedz,Anyone facing same problem as me with the fuel consumption of their Stelvio when using new E10 fuel?. I appear to be getting a drop of about 5 mpg from using E5 fuel anyone facing same problem??.
,
amfalconer,Apparently you can expect around a 10% drop in economy with E10 from what I've heard.
Deman77,"More power, more wheel spin, higher consumption.Also all gunk from e5 clogs up your engine so you are turning it into a 1.2l which is obviously more economical."
Deman77,He got it wrong way around didn’t he? E5 is the good stuff. Some people post without thinking
alfaitalia,A friend with a Merc recons his MPG on the display has dropped away a bit.....but his actual when measured tank top to tank top seems to have not changed.....bit odd.
Zorander2,"Hmmmm, let's see. We're replacing 5% of a hydrocarbon with an alcohol, to try and reduce emissions. But, this will drop fuel economy by around 10%, give or take. So, were putting in 10% more fuel than we did before, that has only 5% less hydrocarbon.....theres something not quite adding up here but my mental maths is rubbish.Anyone care to help me out 🤔"
alfaitalia,Its still less emissions of carbon overall.
Zorander2,"I don't doubt it, because the backlash of it not being so, would be cataclysmic. But, considering how much less, taking into account CO2 production of growing the corn and also that all the cars in the world contribute only about 4% of the entire emissions, I fear the difference its making will be over all miniscule 🙂"
Deman77,alcohol is still hydrocarbon just made out of crops instead of extracted from the ground so you are not producing less carbon by burning it just recycling some of the stuff that is already above ground so releasing less of the ground captured carbon.developing countries’ petrol retailers are decades ahead of us on this. It is possible to fuel with e30 unbeknownst to you - though E in their case may be smth other than ethanol. They frown upon it calling it “dilution” - it ruins engines. Little do they know - not only is it earths friendly it will run those horrid petrol engines into the ground sooner.
Isotope,"I have MY21 Stelvio Veloce and have only ever driven on E10 fuel, driving like Miss Daisy in N the best mpg I can hget is about 25mpg! Is there something wrong with my car?"
alfaitalia,You bought a biggish car with a petrol engine and run it on E10......sounds about average to me.
Isotope,It's a proper learning curve when the Giulia 2.2 did 35mpg no matter how you drove it!

wictod,"Interesting, I only use Shell V-Power E5 .. never use E10 but on some tanks I occasionally get lower mpg for covering the same type of driving and have suspected that I have filled with inferior product... with regards MPG .. on combination town and motorway i'm getting about 30mpg .. and on some long stretches where there's average speed restrictions and i'm on cruise control upto 35mpg .. pure town and it's about 26mpg 280bhp petrol engine"
Isotope,Seems we are alll a lot less than the advertised MPG and I don't drive as hard as I used to do in my diesel cars! Big surprise!
Deman77,"There is a table behind this link that shows energy density per litre and kg. You can see ethanol has 20% worse density of energy. So assuming the engine maintains the same efficiency, swapping extra 5% of petrol for ethanol should only see 1% worse economy. So if actual economy is worse than that there is probably drop in engine efficiency. My mental math instinct is that it is not great for the engine nor for overall emissions but I must be just a dinosaur reluctant to embrace change.Stock take: Are e-fuels part of our future? | AutocarExperts discuss environmental and cost benefits of synthetically created liquid fuelswww.autocar.co.uk"
chichibabin,Can't say I've noticed any drop whatsoever using E10 in my 2020 veloce and I've really been looking. I always fill at Esso which might have something to do with it. Did a motorway run last week from Scotland to Manchester and got 34.7 mpg on E10 (doing around 65 on motorway). On the way back was mainly 70 but still around 33 mpg. Very happy with that.

Deman77,Sorry I’m being thick. Just measuring miles between any two refuels and resetting the trip meter will do.
chichibabin,No. Fill up the tank until the overflow sensor at the pump cuts the supply. Reset the trip and drive as usual. When tank is low refill until the overflow sensor cuts in again. Record the volume of fuel dispensed and the number of miles traveled on the trip.Calculate real mpg= Miles ÷ (litres÷4.546)Compare this value to the trip mpg and see what the discrepancy is.Sent from my Pixel 3 using Tapatalk

First it went in for a service and I left the dealership for my 25 mile trip home got half way and the car stopped engine management light went on and couldn’t go anywhere, typical happened on a roundabout I took a photo and when the tow truck took it back to the dealership they said the car had run out of diesel luckily I took the photo and had 117 miles left of diesel? They had the car for a couple of week changed the sender unit, this happened again a couple more times another few weeks later another sender unit even though each time I kept telling them there was fuel in the tank, after the four time they then changed the fuel tank had the car for three/four weeks waiting for parts from Italy as usual. This now is working but had the car back for a couple of weeks now the engine management light is coming on amber and the battery light is flashing, it went back again another couple of weeks there they say it’s the uxilating water cooler, after picking it up it came on again on the way home so back to the dealership, they kept the car again for four more days and said that it was a loose wire may have been when they changed the fuel tank. Well today after having it back for two weeks it come on again engine management light with the battery light flashing at my wits end, I know the car is under warranty but it’s the inconvenience of not having the car and being given crap hire cars when I should have the equivalent to the value and performance of our car, having to wait for a case to be opened with Alfa then having to wait for parts to come from Italy 7-10 days, the inconvenience of having to take time off work to go and collect the car 50 mile round trip and waste of my time when I pick it up from the dealership and take it back the same day, are we just having bad luck, could this be something the dealership have done dodgy wiring?

Isotope,Why are Beechdale at fault in this? Reason I ask is that I bought a new car last year from them.
cue2,"Beechdale sold you your car new but didn’t sell the OP their car.Warranty , and presumably recall work , does not pay well."
Heather.marsh,"We purchased our Stelvio TI TD AWD 2.2 2019 in April 2021, we feel exhausted and let down now, our car has been back to the dealership over six times looking at seven tomorrow. First it went in for a service and I left the dealership for my 25 mile trip home got half way and the car stopped engine management light went on and couldn’t go anywhere, typical happened on a roundabout I took a photo and when the tow truck took it back to the dealership they said the car had run out of diesel luckily I took the photo and had 117 miles left of diesel? They had the car for a couple of week changed the sender unit, this happened again a couple more times another few weeks later another sender unit even though each time I kept telling them there was fuel in the tank, after the four time they then changed the fuel tank had the car for three/four weeks waiting for parts from Italy as usual. This now is working but had the car back for a couple of weeks now the engine management light is coming on amber and the battery light is flashing, it went back again another couple of weeks there they say it’s the uxilating water cooler, after picking it up it came on again on the way home so back to the dealership, they kept the car again for four more days and said that it was a loose wire may have been when they changed the fuel tank. Well today after having it back for two weeks it come on again engine management light with the battery light flashing at my wits end, I know the car is under warranty but it’s the inconvenience of not having the car and being given crap hire cars when I should have the equivalent to the value and performance of our car, having to wait for a case to be opened with Alfa then having to wait for parts to come from Italy 7-10 days, the inconvenience of having to take time off work to go and collect the car 50 mile round trip and waste of my time when I pick it up from the dealership and take it back the same day, are we just having bad luck, could this be something the dealership have done dodgy wiring? We are going to give them a call tomorrow we are not happy, we just love the car but seem to be having so many problems"
,
Muz,You’d think that dealers who can’t sort problems would flag up with Alfa though. Your excuse for them doesn’t hold water imo. Just because they didn’t sell the car SHOULD make no difference on sorting warranty claims.No wonder Alfa dealers have such a bad reputation. Weren’t Beechdale the ones who handed a brand new QV to a dodgy backstreet valet company for preparation? The one where the video appeared of the guy washing the car and filming revving the nuts off it? Apologies if I got that wrong
cue2,Beechdale pile-em high in just the way the new boss of Alfa Romeo wants to avoid by the “built to order” future. If their way of trading means they don’t see the value to the marque of being helpful to all owners it can’t be helpful but we don’t know the whole story of the car concerned. Perhaps the agency dealership model will help?
ronan,Both our Alfas bought via trade not private.... paid a wee bit more but had peace of mind.....and any problems were sorted.We were lucky.
Navlet,"Back to the OP.Im sorry to hear of your misfortune Heather and yes I think you have been unlucky. Problem is Auto 100 are unlikely to have seen many of these cars and like most dealers they are only interested in selling not after sales so willl be unwilling to help you.I live in Nottingham and would only take my Alfas to Research at Nuneaton for new cars , AF1 or Italiatec for used.I hope you get it sorted, and that you will be able to love your car soon."
cue2,"Most brands try to keep the cars in their own networks , mainly for residual values , but it’s unfortunate if they go to dealers who don’t know them or have any commitment to serving the customers."
Isotope,"Hi Heather, I had an experience not unlike yours where I bought a car from one place and needed some warranty work. Luckily for me it had a good outcome! My Giulia had about 3 weeks of warranty left when the first Covid lockdown cut in, the handbrake switch stopped working and would only engage with P on the gear lever. I took it to Motorvogue in Kings Lynn and they carried out a warranty repair. They were one of the only dealers open at the time! It's like every day in life, you will meet good and bad people, give everyone one chance and never go back to anyone that let's you down. I am a bit concerned that myself as a recent customer of Beechdale, that they would not pick up the mantle for you? Most of us on here have invested in a brand loyalty that despite low volume sales keeps us coming back for more, and any dealer not valuing that deserves to go under. I'm on my fourth Alfa and love them to bits! Thats what you should feel too!Give Beechdale a call and ask for Stuart Wood, Oliver Lloyd or JuliaPepper.Theyare good people who are normally very happy to help!"
Zyp,Interesting - I’m also in Notts and had thought I’d use Beechdale for servicing etc.I did actually go to Research when I was looking to buy (they didn’t have a QV for sale and I ended up buying one from Sytner Tamworth) and quite liked the vibe there.Do you take yours to Research for servicing?
Navlet,"Yes I do use them to service the Giulia and Stelvio which we purchased from them.Its a bit of a drive but they are very good to us, we had a problems with the Stelvio AC and bonnet release which they sorted and gave us a courtesy car both times. Alfa dealers get a bad rep but these are good so I want to stay loyal.Stoneacre Chesterfield are closer and I will contact them 30 days before next service as they have offered me a 2 year service plan £449 + VAT. However I dont know what they are like."
Muz,"If it’s an Alfa service plan you can use it an any Alfa dealer I think?Actually I don’t think, I know because I bought my service plan from the dealer I bought the car from who are too far away for me to go to for a service so I used one more local to me, they were very happy to let me do so and even did some warranty work at the same time"
Navlet,"When I enquired with 3 different dealers last year about service plans for my then 18 month old car I got 3 different answers. One just said they only offer them on new cars, the other two did but at quite different price points.I know people on here have purchased plans and used them elsewhere but not all dealers seem willing to do this.Seems a lottery but Im not surprised.I will try again this year."
cue2,"Ancaster in Dartford eventually admitted they wouldn’t sell me the Mopar plan as they have their own , which they didn’t try to sell me. That was when they were servicing my Stelvio and it was Mopar plan funded. The fact that they didn’t tell me about the condition of the rear discs , which were an MOT item a week later , disappointed me. They did remove the rear skid pan and replace it with a Veloce Ti version , which I provided , free of charge."
Isotope,"I have used Stoneacre Chesterfield for the Giulia servicing and to be fair they treated me as a premium customer, priority treatment etc, once the appointment was booked it was like they were waiting for me when I got there! However it is a multi franchise servicing centre and the courtesy car was some weird underpowered thing that I can't even remember what it was now, maybe a Daihatsu? It was over a couple of years ago, but being ushered into something so unlike what you have is a tad wearing. I know there probably aren't enough Alfa cars in the pool to provide a equivalent courtesy car but a well equipped Fiat/Jeep would not be a bad courtesy car."
wictod,I normally get given low end 500s but got an 500x last time.. can't complain for a day but would get the hump if it was for an extended period of time..
Isotope,"I got lent a 500x by Motorvogue in Kings Lynn and I bought it! I think it is the highest specced car in the country, you can't get a new one with all the gadgets and gizmo's ours has, even got LED headlights, not an option anymore I beleive?"
cue2,Suppliers will often provide examples of their expensive options free to OEMs to get them on demos and get some real orders. The trouble is not many people order the expensive lights instead of spending the same on big alloys!
Isotope,"The trouble is we are at year three and looking to replace it and we can't get a better new car with the same equipment let alone an upgrade! Probably going to be a Daihatsu Tucson Ultimate Hybrid sat next to the Stelvio,but we are hanging on for the Tonale launch before we make a decision!!"
JTD_Liam,"Heather's experience sounds not terribly unusual in regards to parts delays - I've experienced that with Alfa and Fiat long before the current supply chain delays. They're just not great at keeping some items in stock and unlike some competitors, they take far too long to get items to the UK from Italy. Hopefully the tie-up with PSA will resolve this, assuming they're better - our PSA vehicles have never required parts so I've no experience. To be fair the Italian cars haven't needed a great deal but its the time it takes and the clunkiness of the whole operation that makes it feel like a bigger deal than it actually is. Might be worth trying another dealer though - Beechdale seem to do better for sales than aftercare, even for those who bought the vehicle from them.They've just done a tweak to the 500x range & given it the front and rear badges from the new electric 500, with trim levels altering.It's now Club, Cross, Red & Sport and all seem quite generously equipped. However, LED headlights are now only standard on the Sport trim, not even optional on others. When my parents bought their 500x the LEDs were standard on the Cross Plus and Sport and might've been optional on lower trims too. That said their Cross Plus has the LEDs and auto lights but bizarrely no auto wipers, auto dipping rear view mirror or even front armrest- the spec is quite strange. Good engine though (1.0 FireFly T3 120)."
cue2,The 500X no doubt will soon be an Ex-500 when it gets replaced by a rebadged Peugeot.
Muz,"True, my ex demo came with all the bells and whistles other than the leg swinging boot opener and annoyingly no spare wheel. Sunroof, DAP, upgraded sound system were all there though."
Isotope,"Sorry I know this is not a Fiat forum but! Ours is a Cross 1.3 Firefly 150 bhp,it has every option I can see on the new website. Auto dipping LED headlights, adaptive and normal cruise control, blind spot monitoring, front and rear ultrasonic parking sensors, reversing camera, lane departure with active steering, it even goes round bends on its own till it detects you've taken your hands off! 18"" wheels, front fogs that come on in slow speed turns, leather seats, TCT gearbox and we can't find another new car with it all in stock, so probably looking at a factory order to replace it?"

JTD_Liam,"A rebadged Peugeot is an unfair assessment but it (and the Jeep Renegade & Alfa Brennero) are all rumoured to be built in Poland (500/Ypsilon plant) on an evolution of PSAs e-CMP platform from the Peugeot 2008 & new Vauxhall Mokka.Can't say I'm thrilled at the prospect of PSA engines replacing FCA ones as FCA engines seem more mechanically sorted (especially compared to PSA petrols) but as far as electric powertrains go I doubt it'll matter and providing they do enough to differentiate from their Stellantis relatives (2008 & Mokka) then I'm sure it'll be fine, judging by Peugeot's recent efforts."
cue2,"Vauxhall seems to have been reborn under PSA. The Turkish makers of Doblos and the Tipo , Koç Holding , are going to be short of work at this rate. I’m sure they will find something of their own to make and there’s the Transit contract which should grow when the VW Transporter collaboration comes to fruition."
JTD_Liam,"Wow yeah that's a tonne of options. I know they got rid of City Cross & Cross Plus in favour of just 'Cross', but I'd assume Cross was equal to or lower than the standard spec of the 2020 Cross Plus that my parents have. On ours LEDs are standard, but auto dipping function would be an extra, as was adaptive Cruise, blind spot monitoring, front parking sensors (rear & camera are standard on ours), 18"" wheels were standard (I think 19""s were actually standard but you could switch to nicer looking 18s as a no cost option) and leather & lane departure were optional. The cool foglights that come on for cornering are standard though. In fact the 2007 Bravo had that, even though the Alfa Giulietta didn't - I never understand why they give Alfa's lower spec in these areas.You'd definitely need a factory order to match the current one, though annoyingly unless it's a website glitch, you appear to have to add all the option packs together, so even if you just want Leather Pack for example, it forces you to add the other two packs, sending the price through the roof. There was no 1.3 showing since the very recent update either, though a new 1.3 with 130bhp has just launched in the updated Jeep Compass and there's meant to be a new Mild Hybrid engine from the Tonale going into the Compass and Renegade, so whether the 500x is waiting for that too, as they're all built in the same plant. Probably worth a little wait."
cue2,I think they’ll be making batches of 500X in the new Red version to save on all that crazy complexity plus a load for the rental fleets.
JTD_Liam,"Agreed. I've always had a disliking for most Vauxhalls but things like the new Corsa & Mokka are far more appealing than the GM predecessors.I wonder if Fiat will switch the Doblo over to the PSA equivalents (Berlingo/Partner) or carry on as they are, since they've had the PSA tie-up for commercial vehicles for years and always kept Doblo as their own despite the collaboration for Fiorino, Scudo & Ducato. They seem to have scrapped the short lived Renault Trafic / Fiat Talento project as I've had an email tonight from the dealer I bought my Fiat from advertising the new models including the Tonale, new Grand Cherokee and the new electric Scudo, which is clearly a Peugeot Expert with a Fiat badge.I'm surprised they've kept selling the Tipo here - I've seen one of the facelift models and it's been available over a year. They tried to get me into one but no chance - the only engine is a 1.0 Firefly with 100bhp & 5 speed manual. If they'd used the 1.0 Firefly 120bhp with 6 speed manual from the 500x then maybe, but to ditch the diesels and the 1.4 T-Jet 120bhp (TB 120 in the Giulietta) and only have that 1.0 available? No thanks. The prices are silly now too. That said I imagine the factory will be kept busy from sales in Turkey and some of Europe - they're more realistic with pricing there, still have the diesels and have sold far more Tipo's than even a fairly satisfied owner like me would've thought.My biggest concern for factories is Krajujavac in Serbia, who currently build the very old 500L. Would make sense for any new Panda to move there, due to low labour costs, but very little info on that thus far."

I've seem a couple of 21 plate 500x's driving round that look suspiciously like rentals - WM number plates with no dealer name on, etc.There's a tonne of options on 500x's though. Very surprised that Stellantis hasn't put a stop to that like they have on Alfa's. Mind you the 500x is probably the most popular post-2019 Fiat I see after the little 500 & new electric one, so maybe that justifies the option choices."

Besides, it was you that said 'Vauxhall seems to have been reborn under PSA' - I was merely agreeing, they haveBut yes, I can't see how they can possibly keep every factory open. Even if France was more expensive they'd never allow one of them to close, it's just not how France operates, so I fear for one of the Fiat plants in Italy - possibly the one making the Maserati Ghibli & Quattroporte since they could shift production to Mirafiori alongside the Levante for the new models and it's the factory where all product lines are closest to retirement, other than the Serbian plant which will presumably have cost on its side."
Isotope,"We sat in a RED version and it was good, we were told all the TCT models are 1.3 Firefly 150bhp engines so felt good initially, but the salesman kept going back and forwards trying to a deal that took so long we realised how many options our current car had over and above the brand new car. They do have a sport button, but so many things missing! The worst part is that if they had proposed the final offer they could go to after the 1 and half hours of being in the showroom at the first point we probably would have bought the car in the first 10 minutes! Why do car dealers think they can hold you hostage till you agree to £10 over your budget that you told them at the beginning???"
hello.u.its.me,It should be Q4 on the boot I think.
Isotope,"I might be wrong but I am led to believe that all Stelvios in the UK market are 4WD? There is a cheaper 2WD version available in Italy to meet the ""Superbollo"" tax rate ."
JTD_Liam,"Did they confirm that the RED version was definitely a 1.3 Firefly 150? Only asking as the configurator is still showing the latest 500x as only available with the 1.0 Firefly 120 engine. Not unlike Fiat to make a co*k up with the configurator but I was half expecting them to use the slight facelift to the 500x to harmonise engine choices across 500x & Renegade with the Compass and Tonale as there are new options coming on stream that could replace the 1.3 150 TCT.You pretty much have to say your budget is £50 per month lower than reality to get any chance of them being close, I find. Sometimes I swear they do it on purpose. I'm not sure what happened to the idea that if I say my budget is £270 a month, I might actually mean it, so I feel your pain."
JTD_Liam,"I think there was originally a base model 2.2 diesel Stelvio which was RWD only. There might've been one in 'Super' spec too, with the same engine. It was only base model & Super though. As far as I can tell they barely sold any of the lower spec Stelvios with any engine, let alone the RWD version, so I doubt you'll have seen any without Q4.Most i see in the UK are Speciale, Milano Edition & latterly Veloce."
cue2,There are two 2WD Stelvios listed onSearch results for 'Alfa stelvio' - How Many Left?Lower spec Stelvio sales are avoided by better contributions from Alfa on the higher specs which combine with better resiiduals to make a Veloce a few quid a month extra if anything.

cue2,The Tonale is released on next Tuesday.
Isotope,We are really hoping it will be a little Stelvio? But I don't think UK showrooms will have one in stock before June?
JTD_Liam,"Interesting. Must be a configurator mistake that only one engine option is showing then.I imagine there'll be quite a price difference between the 500x and Tonale, not helped by the decent discounts available on the Fiat. The Jeep Compass that Tonale is based on starts at £29k - I've a feeling the Tonale will start at more than £30k, with the PHEV edging £40k, with the editional Road Fund Licence that brings 😕I'd heard it was June for UK launch too, probably a couple of months after European launch."

904 Buster,Has anyone had any experience with changing out the OEM back up lights with brighter ones. If so what did you use?
,
cue2,I think reversing lights are there as much as anything to alert pedestrians you are about to move backwards. I find the combination of parking sensors and reversing camera are fine.
904 Buster,"I disagree. The back up lights primary purpose is for the driver to see while he is backing up. After all if I back in to someone or something, and possibly back up off the road into a ditch or whatever; its my fault. The back up camera and sensors are there to assist the driver in the process.Rear visibility in my Stelvio is not very good. The back-up camera and sensors on mine are less in quality found in many vehicles. And my back up lights are not bright enough for my liking. And you are not very bright as well. If you're going to respond at least make an attempt to answer the question."
alfaitalia,"You are wrong I'm afraid and@cue2is correctFrom an automotive law site I refer to.""Reverse lights ( also called backup lights.) They areused to warn other vehicles and people around the car that the vehicle is about to move backwards. ... Reverse lights on a vehicle must be white in color, and these (at least one) come standard on all vehicles. Reversing lights are for the benefit of other drivers and pedestrians, not to illuminate the way when reversing as they then can look like headlights. Its the reason why they are low wattage.""This is why road worker types fit extra light for visibility when reversing on busy building sites. Nothing illegal about you fitting extra lights or brighter reversing bulbs though.....perhaps LED so they don't get too hot?"
cue2,As somebody who has designed a few taillamps in my career I am aware of their functions and also have a Stelvio. The rear camera has proved very useful along with the sensors and pedestrians can both see the lights and set off the alerts. Next comes a request to make the camera image higher definition to which my response is why?Plus; why “changing out” when it should be either “changing” or “upgrading”?

Alfie155,"""Swapping out"" is a bit annoying too!Actually I tend to agree with the OP in one respect. My night time parking move requires precise placement to avoid putting wheels on grass and destroying a Jasmine plant with the rear bumper.

Isotope,"I had another look tonight and the vertical items are piano black, the rest of the window surround is just rubber seal, like you can see on the Visconti green car in the pictures"
cue2,"Has anybody de- chromed the Stelvio window surround finisher?perhaps a wrap ,over the bright insert?"
cuttlefish,My 71 plate is exactly the same if that's any consolation.
Isotope,"Mine is also 71 plate,only had the car 3 months and I've had to have a new windscreen fitted this week! Can you check for me on the right side behind the rear view mirror there is a cover that houses the FCW camera , rain sensor etc. I now have a 10mm hole that I don't know if it has always been like that or did the fitter remove something that wasn't fit to replace? Hopefully you know what I mean, if its normal, but I'll take a picture tomorrow in the daylight."
cue2,The original black finishers were the same parts as the bright one.This closeup from a 2017 5th gear test shows it well!The kind of in-cycle “cost saving opportunity” all manufacturers take..
Isotope,"Shame, my MY2017 Giulia had all piano black finishers around the windows, I wouldn't want chrome but shame they chose neat rubber, I can even see the joint at the bottom of the rear quarter segment at the bottom of the back window"
makaveli144,"Hi all,Cleaned my new Stelvio for the first time last night and realised the window surrounds are just the bare rubber.My Giulia has gloss black which looks 100× better than the rubber.Does anyone know what spec level or option the gloss black surrounds are as I cant see it on the configurator so cant see where I missed it."
,
cuttlefish,"Same on mine, subtle join is noticeable. I don't think the seals are as obvious to others as we might think, but I'd still rather them have the gloss surrounds :-/"
Isotope,My car is MY21 and it doesn't look too bad in rubber but you know the older cars were better finished. I guess its a sign of the times and the global increased costs?
cue2,The 2022 cars offer the finisher insert in either gloss black or bright finish at extra cost; bright finish 400euros or 500 for gloss black.
Isotope,I'm not quite ready to change my 7 month old car just yet but thanks for the info! Bugger!
cue2,I did mention it in this threadSpot the revised interior trim specto which you replied….
Isotope,My reply on that occaission was more about the seat mechanism and level of equipment on the 500X that we have. The Giulia Speciale that I had did have the gloss black surrounds.
cuttlefish,"Hello Stelvio community! After a 2 year Alfa hiatus since saying goodbye to my Giulia Veloce and Spider, I am back with a brand new Stelvio Veloce, which I took delivery of a few weeks ago 🤩 It's VERY good to be back! I live in a rural spot now and with 3 dogs I needed Q4 and the practicality of the hatch. I'm appreciating the MY21 updates and the car is just lovely to drive, whatever mood you're in. I went for Misano blue with panoramic roof and HK audio. Hope to catch you all soon."
,
monotokpoint,"Not usually a fan of black wheels, but they looks fab with that colour combo!"
gogsygtv,"Agreed, that colour and wheels look really very smart. Enjoy!"
manc350,"Welcome back !! i have a 21 Veloce in Red with brown leather and black wheels, loving it so far. Misano had me debating for a while, nearly had your car's twin"
GVblue,"I think Misano blue is the best Alfa colour at the moment (excluding the uber expensive ones) but as I already have a Misano blue Giulia, my wife decided two of the same colour would be a bit sad, hence, I ended up with the traditional Alfa red. But boy, does it wax up and shine well.The black wheels work a treat with both colours and really make them stand out."
Deman77,Misano also looks no worse on cloudy winter day (manages to catch whatever light there is) and looks pretty clean from the distance until you have it properly caked.but it’s splitting hairs. It’s hard to find a bad looking Stelvio.
cuttlefish,"Thanks everyone! I never used to like black wheels but this had me convinced. They are, however, a pain to keep looking clean. Happy to be acquainted with fellow Stelvio drivers"
Isotope,"Hi Cuttlefish, welcome back! I've replied to you on the window surround thread. I love the Misano blue colour and I went to look at swapping my Grey Giulia Speciale for a Misano Blue Giulia Veloce. As we walked around the dealership, I saw what would be my first brand new Alfa, a Stelvio Veloce in Alfa red! I've always wanted a red Alfa and a couple of years ago circumstances meant that I had to cancel a 147 Selespeed in Alfa red. We're a bit like you, thinking of getting a Tonale when we can but two red Alfa's on the drive might look a bit much so thinking a Misano blue Tonale as and when if available?"
W1NST,That is one good looking Stelvio!
cuttlefish,"Definitely keen to see what the Tonale actually looks like in a week or so's time at the Premier. I've noticed on the AR website, they've stripped the Stelvio range right down, and the Veloce has lost some of the spec and options. Strange, I'm not aware of any updates coming soon, and it's supposed to soldier on alongside the Tonale. Anyway, 2 Alfa's on the drive is never a bad thing, regardless of model or colour... do it!"
manc350,Hi...So my 2021 Stelvio is misting up when parked overnight.. i always run on AC with heat and can't find any wet bits insie the car.Car was fine until the cold snap kicked in and damp mornings / evenings. Car lives outside but so does my wife's merc coupe and that has no mist .Any suggestions what may cause this ?Cheers.
,
Muz,No help to you with the cause but I had similar on a few occasions early this year when it was cold and icy. One morning I even had a light misting of ice on the inside of the passenger side. Only happened a couple of times so I did nothing about it as I doubted it could be traced unless it was happening when it went to the dealer.
Muz,Double post
VeloceRosso,I had a similar thing happen with mine last winter.I put one of those bags of silica that you find in the boxes of electronic things when you buy them. Left it on the dashboard a couple of nights and the problem went away.I guess there was some damp in the cabin somewhere.it worked for me anyway so hope it helps.
jwq,"Check the cabin air filter to make sure this is still good,"
mikesalfa,"Someone, (dealer) who knows may have left a window or door open when raining so water entered the car. Even if no carpet or seat feels damp, it may still harbour damp. Or you drive around, with lots of people in it, pets etc. Heater on, A/C on. Car is nice and warm, lots of people breathing. Lots of moisture entering the cars warm atmosphere. You park, people leave, air temperature in car drops. Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, cool air dumps it's moisture wherever it can (windows, fabrics etc)."
Old Engineer,The A/C unit forms ice when being used but it needs to dissolve and drain out when you stop. If you haven't got a puddle underneath 5 minutes after stopping you have proved it's not draining to the outside.
alfaitalia,"I would be checking under the mats for damp in the carpet....far and away the most common cause of condensation. My car was misting heavily about a month ago....turned out the scuttle drain was blocked allowing water to get in via the HVAC.....I unblocked the drain, dried the carpet by leaving a couple of newspapers under my rubber mats for a couple of days... Sorted....not steamed up at all since."
Deman77,I’d go with this as first theory for OP especially if it’s not persisting. We had unusually high humidity in the air in UK and something like 7-8 degrees overnight temperature drops. If you drove with no a/c on (a/c dries air out) or windows open or doors/boot are open a little too long after the journey and there is very humid air inside. That drop in temperature especially on the windows which are the least insulated spot could be enough to get the water in the air to reach a dew point.the bigger the temperature drop and the higher the air humidity the more likely it is.if it does persists into the drier air conditions only then I would suspect something adding moisture inside and look for damp.
manc350,Commented on a few treads about this related to Stelvio and Giulia.. so..Realised after a few people commented that I had auto recirculation set.. turned it off and have run the car for a couple of weeks and no more condensate... my bad.. but happy i now have a resolution !
Muz,"Same, except I changed from manual to auto. Occasionally get misting whilst driving on the driver’s window but 10 seconds of max on window demisting clears itImpressed with the heating on the Stelvio"
GVblue,"manc, just to clarify by ""auto recirculation"" I presume you mean the bottom button where you can toggle between A and M?I've read the handbook but I just can't get my head round the icons and buttons on this control. What is the difference between 'AUTO' and 'A' and 'M' ?In my past Alfas there was just the choice of auto or manual. What is the optimal setting with the Giulia/Stelvio?"
manc350,"EDIT....Hi GVblue.. yes button in pic below with number 15 .. There are 2 states for internal air recirculation - On or OffThe auto buttons (button 2 and 8) set auto temp etc climate control for driver and passenger and are independent from recirculationIf you have it on there are 2 types of recirculation it does -M = always on, always recirculate cabin air and gives fast internal temp warm up...A = let the car decide it it needs to recirculate .. not sure how it does this.. maybe a sensor for temp or quality ?It can be accessed from screen also from button 4 below - (button 2 and 7 are passenger and driver auto climate control)I would use the car and it would warm up, clear the fogging after about 5 mins and after use park with clear screen.. But next time I used the fog would come back instantly on start-up as moisture still in system. I have it now as off completely, so it is always drawing in fresh air and my fogging has stopped completely.. for me off is optimal to stop the haze although sat in stopped / slow moving traffic on a dry day with fumes around me I will go with on and manual so always on but turn back off as soon as practical.It was previously set to On and with setting Auto to A when I was finding the car would be either already steamed up in the morning or would steam up on start.. since I changed it then had a good run in the car to get everything nice and hot / dry I have not had any fogging on cold / damp mornings or using during the rain etc."
manc350,"As well as my edit above re auto climate button just read this for the first time how auto and conditions can affect stop start.. which might explain some oddities when a warm day at least -START&STOP EVO The automatic dual-zone climate control system manages the Start&Stop Evo (engine off when the car speed is 0 km/h) to ensure adequate comfort inside the car.In particular, the automatic dual-zone climate control systemdeactivates the Start&Stop Evoif: the automatic dual-zone climate control system is in AUTO mode (LED on the button switched on) and the temperature conditions inside the vehicle are far from a comfort temperature; the automatic dual-zone climate control system is in LO maximum cooling; the automatic dual-zone climate control system is in HI maximum heating; the automatic dual-zone climate control system is in MAX-DEF mode. With Start&Stop Evo function on (engine off and car stopped), the flow is reduced as much as possible, to keep the compartment comfort conditions for longer"
GVblue,"Thanks manc350I had forgotten all about the touchscreen controls, mainly because I hate using touchscreens whilst driving. I was having great fun playing with it on the drive though until a bloody great spider crawled from under the dashboard to see what I was doing.I decided a bit of mist on the screen wasn't such a problem after all."
Navlet,"Our Stelvio Speciale has 19 inch wheels Pirelli Scorpion tyres.Compared to the Giulia ( Potenza Run Flats) which is poised sure footed and predictable if not a little firm the handling is twitchy, very camber sensitive on anything other than a perfect surface, even going over a painted white line makes it twitch especially when wet. I know being a 4x4 its not going to be the same but we ve had two 4x4s previously and they felt alot better.On good surfaces its fine.Not sure if its the tyres or tracking, would be interested to hear what other tyres people are running and their experiences."
,
cue2,I went for Michelins when I upgraded to 20” wheels on my Stelvio. The Pirelli Zeros on my Giulietta were a bit of a disappointment too so they were replaced with Goodyears.
Deman77,"I am assuming you are talking verde and not winters. I have never heard good things about scorpion verde. I recall Volvo XC90 was extremely sensitive to tyre choice and original contis were awful. Then they started shipping the with scorpions and Michelins and the latter were great whilst scorpions not good.What you are describing - even going over white lines - makes me think it’s this unnecessary movement right at the top of the suspension travel. my QV has it too. It goes away if you push her but if you drive for comfort it is always there - any sort of unevenness she rocks a little - twitch is probably too much of a word. It is noticeable stepping out of a non-suv into Stelvio, so compared to excellent even for saloon Giulia you will really notice it. It’s less noticeable on good tyres - summer PZ4s are an improvement over stiffer side wall scorpion winters for me. But recommended pressure range is quite wide for QV. Oddly, I find it does better nearer the upper end of pressure. So I went higher pressure with scorpions winters and it’s ok.tramlining could be unrelated alignment related but again could be helped by pressure.If you get twitchiness at the limit of grip then note if you are running summer tyre in sub 5-7c conditions it will be a lot harder rubber esp in the wet where temperature cannot be maintained. Different tyre will respond differently. generally it will be loss of traction that could manifest itself on different ways. I know that pz4 in the wet 7c loses traction on full beans even in 3rd gear on QV. Michelin summers are known to do well way into lower temperatures if you are going to experiment but prefer to stick with summers.I would start with just two extreme ends of pressure range to see if it makes a difference with bumpiness. Do use a good gauge if at home. I have a well calibrated dedicated gauge and I find gauges on the pumps I use can be out quite a bit."
Navlet,Yes Verde tyres.Good info - I will play around with tyre pressures and see if that makes a difference. Im sure it could be better..
wictod,I had proper worn out Scorpion Verdes and experienced the same issue.. crossing the painted lines especially when wet and the back felt very unstable almost like you've run over something in the road.. didn't like that feel at all.. After 25k swapped to Michellin Pilot 4 SUV and not a problem.. so would suggest not the tracking but tyres.. was running 32psi front 34 psi rear on the Pirellis.
Navlet,That describes it perfectly almost as if for a split second the back isn't connected to the front.
wictod,"Yep exactly that, like a split second of weightlessness but through your backside..."
Navlet,After some consideration I decided to get the two rear Scorpion Verde tyres changed. I checked the tread and they were down to 2-3 mm ( fronts 4 -5mm ) and in these cold climates and wet roads I had lost confidence in them.I have decided to go for Scorpion Verde All Season tyres so had them done this lunchtime along with the tracking which was slightly out.I have never had All Season tyres before but their popularity is rising and if the manager of the Tyre shop is true many Police forces and Ambulance fleets are now using them.Time will tell if I made a mistake but on the short drive home they seemed better.
Isotope,"I have a 2.0 veloce Stelvio and it's on 20"" Michelin Latitudes, they do seem to be quite capable and much more compliant after having a Giulia with the runflats on 18"" wheels. They also go over most potholes without any noise/problems, very important where I live in poor Lincolnshire!!"
gogsygtv,Another one for Michelins just fitted to replace Scorpion Verdes. I went for the All Season Cross Climates and very happy. Stopped getting the full lock scrub as well as a bonus (probably would of happened with any new tyres though I would guess).
Isotope,I still get the scrubbing on full lock with the Michelins but they do seem very good. I drive the car pretty hard and the wear rate is really good. Just approaching 8k miles and still got about 4mm of tread on the rears. Does anyone move the tyres from front to back or do you just replace as and when needed? The Michelins are about £200 a corner!!
pocholin,"My previous car, a 2017 Volvo V90 T6, had these Verde all season tyres,...I HATED them and they were damn scary on the snow. I had never bought dedicated snow tyres for my cars but because they were like summer tyres on the snow. Literally, the second day of snow I decided to stop driving it and get snow tyres since those still had over half of their life in them. They were marginally okay on dry and in the summer but nothing worth keeping. When the time came I changed them with Pirelli Cinturato P7s, All Season, and loved them the rest of the car's ownership. I would highly recommend those Cinturatos, good price and great performance in ALL seasons."
wictod,Looks like he's having fun...
alfaitalia,11F is nearly minus 12 C....nippy!
wictod,I thought I heard him wrong.... brain fog.. never considered Fahrenheit .. cripes that is cold
pocholin,"This was last week in Chicago, going home from my daughter's horseback riding lesson...that morning was -18CI am running my tyres at 33 lbs cold, thus the TPMS light...so be it!"
RMT,My 2021 Stelvio keeps turning back on the lane warning sign and noise even though I keep turning it off.How do I turn this off permanently?Second is there any way to have the GPS map stay in daylight mode even at night as I fine it very hard to read in night mode?
,
pocholin,"Did you change any of the speakers that makes you get the speaker failure sign? That will force it to permanently. If you didn't then you should be able to select the warning type in ""driver's assistance"" menu.GPS map, enter the map, then press your settings button on the center console, there's an area where to select day, night, auto."
RMT,"Hi thanks for the try but I havent changed any speakers, its not the noise Im worried about, I just want to turn the lane assist off and not have it keep turning on again.For the GPS I understand you can change it BUT on auto it goes automatically dark at night or even a dull rainy day and its just about impossible to read. If I push Day sure it goes to day mode but as soon as it dark it goes back the the dull night unreadable colours. I want it to stay on day lighting all the time."
pocholin,"Oh, inside Infotainment>Display you'll find the brightness control for day and night, you just need to match both"
Pinny100,"Hi there,I've a 2018 Stelvio Quadrifoglio and I keep getting the 'service automatic lights' message come up in the dashboard intermittently with a warning light. Its been to the dealership twice and they've not been able to resolve the issue. Has anyone else had a similar problem? According to the handbook the warning light is for 'automatic directional lights failure' but the lights seem to be working OK?"
,
cue2,Are they still steering when you drive around corners?https://www.stelvioforum.com/attachments/lighting-pdf.18192/
Isotope,Do all Stelvios have this feature?
wictod,"Mine doesn't 2018 Specialie but the Mrs 500x does, we weren't sure why the light was doing what it does... what is the point of this feature?"
GVblue,Veloces do and I find it both annoying and pointless. much prefer the static ones on our Giulie
Muz,"The lights on my Stelvio are without a doubt the best lights I have ever had on a ,car. The auto lights are also a complete godsend to me"
925,"Hello, recently purchased used Stelvio. What bothers me is mismatched colour of wood trim. The central console is sort of blueish/greenish colour while top one is fine brown. Images do not represent authentic difference but you get an idea pretty accurately. Has anyone dealt with this weird colour mismatch? I bet central console was cleaned with something not suitable for wood trim. I wonder is there any chance to bring colour back."
,
cue2,"Have you tried cleaning the centre console veneer? It’s microns thick so you need to be gentle but cleaning it might get rid of the blue tint. You could see if Faurecia , the suppliers, have any advice."
joephoto,"It could be due to the sun hitting/not hitting one trim piece versus the other and causing the discoloration. If cleaning won’t help, it may be something that you have to live with of you can’t replace the trim."
925,"No, I don't know how to do it. Do you mean using polishing machine?Knowing it was mostly used in very mild climate zone (more rain than sunshine) i doubt it. Also, it is perfectly discoloured all the way to the cup holder lid which means it was probably intensively cleaned using something weird. At least the real wood colour is not that warm brown/yellow that some Stelvios features so the difference is not THAT bad."
Isotope,"There's a Jaguar dealer in Lincoln that sells cars with breaks, does that not worry you as a car driver or am I pedantic ****? I have some Alpha red paint from the dealer that sold me my car!"
,
wictod,"Hi All,Went to fill up yesterday and noticed the fuel flap looked a bit misaligned, I've had a few occasions where it doesn't close on the first push as if it's not mating to the latch correctly, anyway, I found that the painted flap appears to be moving slightly from the big black plastic hinge it's connected to if you grab hold of it and give it a wiggle.. there's also a noticeable gap between the back of the flap (petrol cap side) to the length of the plastic hinge as if it is coming away from the hinge or not clipped in correctly.Not sure how the flap connects to the hinge or whether it's glued in to make the flap bend to the surface of the hinge (which is curved in itself to replicate the exterior lines of the car) and didn't want to snap the thing off but it defo not closing properly??Done some reading on the other StelvioForum and there's few out there with this problem that are apparently under warranty so guess it's another trip back for a check up and see what they say?Some others have reported the flap mechanism freezing in cold weather so wonder with Winter coming up if there's any preventative maintenance for the freezing like some spray or something as I don't fancy caught out in the few really bad cold days we normally get here once a year.. (I'm assuming there's a manual release somewhere in the boot)?The fuel flap closed photo doesn't look as bad as when I first saw it after some pushing the flap but it's still noticeable..Cheers"
,
cue2,The plastic is affected by temperaturehttps://www.alfaowner.com/Forum/alfa-giulia/1121505-giulia-fuel-lid.htmlMine fits at the moment.
wictod,"Thanks Cue2, so this is happening on Giulias as well then.. I was thinking maybe some double sided tape inside the gap to hold it.. wonder what it'll look like as the temp really starts to drop?"
Sweeney70,Had the same on mine.Took it back to dealer who were going to replace it and put it in the paint shop to match the colours up.But instead they adjusted it and now it's looking pretty flush to me.
Gator1,"My fuel cap was not totally flush for a while. Then somehow it corrected itself. So@cue2must be right, temperature sensitive."
DaleC1964,"I had the same issue with my ex, a Giulia, and the flap was replaced under warranty. So far, the flap on the Stelvio has not shown any signs of movement, although we've yet to have any really cold nights."
Saxon6,"I have the same issue which started about two weeks ago. I thought they had redesigned this as it’s a known issue. Mine is a MY19 build, so obviously they haven’t . :tired:"
GVblue,"First sign of winter up here in the Peak District a week ago.The fuel flap on my Giulia (same design as Stelvio) went from convex shape to concave.I just put up with it last winter, I'll see how bad it gets this.Much the same as I am doing with the alarm."
Mash1138,"Hiyes, just noticed, this has happened on mine too...when it goes in for recall, will hopefully get sorted."
wictod,"My fuel flap has got so loose I was afraid it would come off mid flight so I've done a quick fix that appears to work well.. I know the purists will hate me for this and say just take it back and get Alfa to sort it but I just have the time at the moment... Anyway the I looked at the flap this morning and just slightly wiggled it and it just popped off, while it was off I can see that top and bottom of the flap is 3 grooves which slot in and and push the flap forwards towards the front of the car and they snap into position.. in the middle of the assembly towards the rear there's a wedge non return flap that doesn't work very well as it easily popped off mine..What I have done (refer to initial photo first post) is run a little hot glue along the edge that is clearly coming away from the black hinge assembly and hold in position with some pressure so it's reshaped to the profile of the hinge.. there's a couple of places where this is really evident.. once cooled off it has retained it's shape nicely. More importantly for me I don't think the flap is going to drop off whilst i'm driving now and if I have to take it back in for a fix the glue is easy to separate from the assembly. I know I shouldn't be doing this but it's doing my nut in thinking the flap is going to come away.. cheersOh and also a little rubber grease on the latching mechanism as that was sticking on some occasions and apparently in really cold places this has frozen just when you don't want it to.."
cue2,The hinge cannot be moulded into the flap as any feature on the back thicker than 50% of the flap itself will create a sink mark on the front surface. That’s what they teach at design school anyway.
wictod,"cue2, I'm not that academicand i'm sure you're correct here and will endeavor to understand the design principles but I think what I'm doing is sort of different to what you've described, I've made the flap follow the contour of the hinge as it's supposed to be before the elements have forced them apart.. I guess the forces are still that way with the flap trying to come away from hinge but held in position by the glue, hopefully over time those forces will reduce as there won't be any forces pulling away from each other.. Cheers"
wictod,"Update: The hot glue didn't work, after a cold night it's come adrift again and looks worse like a dried out sandwich curling up at the ends.. Has anyone been in for this to be fixed? I just don't fancy a primed part then a duff colour match from the local spray boys.."
Mash1138,"Mine is not flush anymore either. When I had the fuel recall done, mentioned this, they sais this was a design flaw on early models, mine must have slipped through the cracks. Are getting a new updated flap orderd to fit. hope this will cure it??"
Sweeney70,mines got really bad in the last couple of weeks.it's quite a gap toady after a motorway journey in the cold weather. I'm really not wanting to go back to the dealer again though.
wictod,Booked into dealer for Monday for fuel flap and start / stop / battery issue..... leathered the car down the other day and when I went across the fuel flap it come offgot to get it sorted now..
Mash1138,Mine booked in to get flap done on the 9th...
Bobbybear,Just contacted Dealer today.Seriously this is a bit embarrassing as that is closed position.
W1NST,"Same here contacted my dealer, sent them some pictures and they are ordering a new one in and getting it painted."
Alfie155,"Taking my Milano back to Slough for the fuel gauge recall on Monday week. I mentioned the fuel flap issue and that the stop-start function has stopped. He said In that case we'll need the car a couple of days rather than the while-you-wait gauge software fix.I use one of those accessory socket plug-in gizmos that shows volts and (interior) temp.On my MX5 the volts seldom drops below 14 but on the Stelvio it usually hovers around 13.5/13.8. I know that, electrically, there is more going on but is the alternator up to the job or is it 'just' the battery?Returning to the fuel flap issue, if they just fit another one, wont that distort as well or is the whole assembly improved in some way?"

wictod,"Had mine in the dealers today.. 1. They have reshaped the flap with some heat and it looks flush at the moment, they reckon it's been changed already so not sure what's going on but I'll see what happens. Arriving early on a frosty morning I had a look around their parking lot, all but one of the Stelvios had badly warped fuel flaps including 2 brand new cars without plates on? 2. One of the cells in the battery was shot so they replaced the battery but have put an original one and not the AGM type which I hoped they would.. , again I'll have to see if it lasts.. but can't complain, got to talk with the technician who gave me the confidence that if there was any issues just bring it back.."
wictod,"UPDATE: So the dealer fix didn't last long and bent out of shape again but since then the warm weather has returned and the fuel flap has gone back to being perfectly flush.So now I'm thinking, what can I do to keep it there so it doesn't go wonky again when it gets cold.. seems like the perfect time to work out a fix.. Originally I tried hot glue run along the seem with some pressure to hold it in shape.. that lasted about 2 weeks before it came away.. anyone got any suggestions what could hold the flap in the perfect position knowing that when it gets cold it's going to try and bend again (superglue maybe?).. oh excuse the dust on the car.. I've polished it twice since lock down but haven't gone anywhereand it keeps getting crappy.."
Sweeney70,Sorry no suggestions from me but mines gone back into shape too. Noticed it the other day looking perfectly flush.My dealer wanted to replace the filler flap and take the car into the paint shop for two days which seemed a bit excessive.

cue2,When my wife’s car was a Kuga it rarely got washed because it was such a pointy unpleasant shape to put a sponge on. The Stelvio is lovely in comparison.

Ok so if I read this correctly, my Italian is not that good and the hopefully the translation is better, that appears to be the fix from Alfa Romeo HQ that was passed down to a dealer in Germany to fix a customers car? Also the results aren't perfect but the thread is dated 23 January 2018 so it was during the cold season.. wonder if the customers flap is good now? Cheers"
cue2,No need to get in a flap after all. Just modify the existing part. Maybe that explains the good colour match.
jwq,"yeah, apparently what they do is remove/slide of the metal flap from the plastic clips, then cut v-shaped notches out of the plastic to make it less rigid in order to keep it from deforming the metal caused by the different expansion coefficients of metal & plastic, and replace the metal cover.....see also :"
cue2,Which part is metal?The door isNylon.PA66
wictod,If it is it's non ferrous as I can't get a magnet to stick to it?

wictod,"Hi All,Went to fill up yesterday and noticed the fuel flap looked a bit misaligned, I've had a few occasions where it doesn't close on the first push as if it's not mating to the latch correctly, anyway, I found that the painted flap appears to be moving slightly from the big black plastic hinge it's connected to if you grab hold of it and give it a wiggle.. there's also a noticeable gap between the back of the flap (petrol cap side) to the length of the plastic hinge as if it is coming away from the hinge or not clipped in correctly.Not sure how the flap connects to the hinge or whether it's glued in to make the flap bend to the surface of the hinge (which is curved in itself to replicate the exterior lines of the car) and didn't want to snap the thing off but it defo not closing properly??Done some reading on the other StelvioForum and there's few out there with this problem that are apparently under warranty so guess it's another trip back for a check up and see what they say?Some others have reported the flap mechanism freezing in cold weather so wonder with Winter coming up if there's any preventative maintenance for the freezing like some spray or something as I don't fancy caught out in the few really bad cold days we normally get here once a year.. (I'm assuming there's a manual release somewhere in the boot)?The fuel flap closed photo doesn't look as bad as when I first saw it after some pushing the flap but it's still noticeable..Cheers"
,
wictod,"Looking at the cuts, I would of thought that would exacerbate the problem... but then again i'm no engineermaybe there's metal in those sections?"
cue2,Where is there any metal in this?I’m confused.
jwq,"yeah, obviously doesn't work as intended, as the problem still persistsguess there could still be stress between parts, if they're made of different plastics (flap and retainer).....afaik, there's no real sollution in the way of a new/modified cover, as the problem still happens and seems to come back over time in replaced parts, under influence of temperature .... It does however appear to be reversable though, when temp changes again"
cue2,The v cuts in the webs which come off the back surface of the door will reduce their ability to maintain the curvature in the door!

wictod,"Over the last few cold days mine has also changed but this is the least pronounced warp I have seen under these conditions, wondering whether age reduces the effect over time? Mine's a 2018 build and was really noticeable in the past.."
cue2,I’m just happy it’s on the passenger side so I don’t look that often at the form. If the flap was made of metal like the one on my wife's Toyota it‘d retain its form.

The battery is on the way out though.On the other hand though, the fuel flap on my 2018 Giulia Veloce curls up like a cheese quaver in winter, although this does seem to be happening less each year but normally, around now, I would be un-clipping the cover, placing it on a warm radiator and weighting it to bend it back to its original shape.This will last another year and whilst a bit of a nuisance I find it a better solution than a new replacement where the colour match may be not quite right and with no guarantee the new one won't deform."

Zyp,"I posted this on a different thread a few weeks ago…But having now read all of this thread, perhaps it still won’t work. Although Tigerseal is bloody strong stuff..‘So I’ve noticed my flap sticks out a bit at the top. What I’ve also noticed is that it should be easy to fix by glueing (Tigerseal possibly) and clamping the flap to the plastic frame - particularly at the point where the dimple is.It seems that this is the reason for the warping - if the frame and flap were joined together mechanically then no warp would occur.’"

To labour the point, our 500x has every gizmo you can think of, we went to look at a new one and there isn't another car on sale today in stock with the same level of equipment, it will have to be a factory order to get close towhat we already have and you can't get the LED headlights anymore!"
Deman77,6’2” and I have been steadily moving nearer to steering wheel to get closer to the optimal position for the arms. With steering column barely coming out I end up well ahead of the b pillar so the function works for me and I really appreciate it.When I first got the car and set it up as a comfy lounge chair mainly for leg comfort the function was not working as I was behind b pillar and I was so far from the steering wheel it wasn’t necessary. I couldn’t drive like this now - I now notice shoulder strain if elbows are not resting against the torso and it bothers me if I had to regrip opposite arm at anything other than 90 degree low speed sharp turn. Legs had to learn to adjust though - luckily no clutch.I’d pay for the function now if it was optional.
cue2,see what follows the word Sellerie for the Sprint spec.
,
cue2,Two options on the French price list are for window surrounds; bright finish 400euros or 500 for gloss black. Both as an alternative to the plain black rubber found on many Stelvios.
manc350,Alfa used to be quite good at spec / pack pricing on the Stelvio.. almost in line with BM Audi and Merc bundling the options sensibly.. but now appears latest spec is back to the old school of everything is an option.... wow.. next they will not underseal them.. oh wait.. too late.
cue2,That’s what they’re all planning now Covid and chip crises have reset supply and demand. BMW is planning to charge for activating some functions. Removing a couple of regular features and making them options forces people to make a factory order.
savannahsister,"Does anyone else tow a caravan? We've recently bought a heavier one, and whilst its a good match ontowcar.info, I feel that even at optimal nose weight, the Stelvio sags and the back of the caravan is raised. My husband thinks we need new springs and shocks. Its a 67 model. Surely it cant be knackered already? Has anyone else had this issue?"
,
alfaitalia,"What nose weight is your van set at? Have you weighted it on a noseweight gauge or bathroom scales? The biggest issue we get with customers using the Stevio to tow with is the rather pathetic 70kg noseweight ALFA quote on many of the newer ones (yours is 90). Many run of the mill saloon cars have a higher limit than that and most SUVs higher still....for example my Jeep was 140kg. I set that at 100kg nose weight (the maximum limit for any UK caravan)....and it towed levelish and rock solid. As you probably know the ideal stance is slightly nose down....level is ok just about....never tow nose up....air flowing under the van at speed make for a horrible towing experience,."
savannahsister,85kg
savannahsister,85kg
alfaitalia,Well thats not far away from the 90 kg limit for your model....Im surprised you have an issue. How high is the top of the towball when no caravan is on it.
savannahsister,"My book says limit for mine is 95kg. However, it's not sagging with no caravan on it. Do u mean in inches from the ground? Our previous caravan was 75kg nose weight and we didn't have an issue at all."
alfaitalia,"Nose weight is dictated by the car ....not the caravan........getting as close to the car NW limit as possible (without going over or exceeding the hitches 100kg limit) will always give a good stable tow.....nothing tows worse than a van with too LITTLE noseweight. Ideally the top of the towball with no van on and the car empty should be around 17.5 inches (450mm) from the ground on a level surface. The main thing is , that the caravan tows well and does not feel like its on the verge of snaking all the time....as long as its not very low to the point of the jockey wheel touching down over humps and sleeping policemen that I would not worry too much."
savannahsister,"Thanks, it's not so low that it's bumping. It's just that the back of the van looks higher and thats spooks us a little."
alfaitalia,Better than the other way around.....
savannahsister,"Well, yes!"
alfaitalia,Give us a shout if you need any other caravan info....if you don't know I'm the sales manager at a caravan dealer on the South Coast.....worked there 20 years in October.
W1NST,i have been towing a 1500kg Dethleffs with our 2018 Stelvio Speciale 210 Q4 for the last 3 years & it‘s the best tow car we have had in 16 years of caravanning. How heavy is your caravan and is your Stelvio Q4 / AWD?
savannahsister,Thank you!
savannahsister,"MTPLM 1541kg and yes its Q4/AWD. Tows beautifully, its just that we bought a new caravan, and it sits differently"
W1NST,"I think you will be fine then, as another member said as long as you haven’t got problems with your jockey wheel being too near to the floor. We also find the rear end to be angled upwards a bit but have never experienced a problem in thousands of miles of towing with the Stelvio to date. Just be thankful we both have the older models with higher nose weight and 210 bhp as you can only get the higher bhp on the top of the range trims now I believe."
savannahsister,"Yes, thanks. I'll be keeping this car, I love it so much."
Isotope,"Woke up today thinking my key fob battery needed replacing, got the spare and still no joy. So opened the drivers door with the key blade and still no life from the dashboard when I got in. So diagnosed a flat battery fairly quickly. Note drivers door is the only one you can open with no voltage. I connected my 1000amp Noco jumpstarter and it wasn't enough to revive the bella? We got it started doing things the old fashioned way with a jump start from the 500x at 3500rpm. Has anyone had a similar experience I think the internal lighting caused the current drain but I don't know why? Roof lights came on when the external booster was connected? Once we got it started every fault you can imagine came up, TPMS, ATS, Hillholder, FCWs, AAC, no DNA, adaptive lighting, Jesus wants me for a sunbeam dash board! Took it for a 75 mile drive and most faults cleared except for ATS, FCWS and AAC, switched it off, at the next restart all appears to be okay. I've got it on the Alfa battery conditioner at the moment but I'm struggling to understand what happened. I did note the central console was illuminated for a long time after key off but the park brakelight switch takes about 5 minutes to go off, is this normal?"
,
Deman77,"So humid and then snaps cold. Lots of condensation. Could be some short getting created somewhere.let’s hope it was a one off, but the battery willNot be the same again - deep discharge reduces capacity, so it will take less effort to get it flat now.I’d fit a monitor to hopefully spot if you have repeating parasitic drain. Keeping it on tender could just mean you will not know and it will drain on you somewhere away from home.if monitor shows a systematic drain could try going through a fuse box to narrow it down."
wictod,Hopefully it's the battery that failed rather than some weird electrical / computer gremlin.. shame the Noco didn't start it.. I've got a similar booster that has come in handy for other vehicles including GTV 3.0.. it had no problems starting that from flat but I did find it needs someone to make sure the connections are really tight on the posts (sort of holding the clips but forcing them to grip).. I also regularly take it out the car and run it down a bit then charge it to be sure it's full..... I never considered a jump start old school as I thought these new cars didn't work like that.. the Mrs has 500x so I know where to go now if I have the same grief..
Isotope,"Whatever you do if faced with the same problem do not connect to the negative pole of the battery on either car. The Stelvio and Giulia for that matter has a post under the bonnet, really dissapointed the 500x didn't have a similar setup, but there's a nut on the left side of the battery box that provided a good ground. Just wish I knew what caused the issue in the first place? The internal lights are LED's so wouldn't think they would drain the battery overnight but I can't think of anything else?"
cue2,I think there’s some potential in the “sticky” radio knob theory since my wife recently waited in the car while I visited my mum in hospital. She wasn’t sure if she’d switched it off after switching it back on while she sat in the car then went for a stroll.
wictod,Good advice thanks... I've heard that the infotainment power button can be sticky leaving the unit on but I'm sure you'd see that before getting out the car.. I find myself standing outside the car waiting for the high pitch noise to stop before I go indoors... supposedly things are still shutting even after you've locked it?
Isotope,"You both might have a point because I sat there trying to start the car thinking "" Who needs the ******* radio on right now!"" it kept coming back on as soon as there was enough voltage! I've noticed that the LED in the park brake switch takes about 5 minutes to go off, is this normal?"
Maximus84,Yesterday our Stelvio's battery completely died for the second time in 3 weeks. I think the battery was just shot. I was an hour away from home but was able to jump start it. Last time it happened I put it on full overnight charge with a CTEK so it's completely discharged in 3 weeks.Didn't test for a parasitic drain but I've suspected the battery has been dodgy for a while. Ordered and fit a brand new battery today so we'll see how that fares...
Isotope,"I have the Alfa branded CTEK charger but it is only a battery maintainer, don't think it can provide enough charge to get the car going in less than 12 hours of use but could be wrong? I've now got 2 lights on so looks like it's working, the car is only 6months old so hope the battery has a couple of years left in it?"
Isotope,"I did notice the centre console lights seemed to be on for a long time last night, but just thought that was part of the normal shutdown? Then the two lights in the boot were constantly on but dim, like old LEDs with voltage monitoring? Today they go off properly so what were they trying to tell me?"
Deman77,Did you hear the double beep when locking? If the door is not properly closed it will not central lock and it continues to draw current. Mine goes dark pretty much straight away.Can you also check you don’t have any leads plugged into USBs. I am not sure all USB ports go dead on shut down and with all the condensation in this weather leads could get shorted.
Deman77,I also would disable keyless access for a while. Handle touch wakes the car up regardless of whether it will get unlocked or not. Mine is disabled for that reason as it reacts to car being washed. I wonder if with weird moist air the door handle sensors get triggered and wake the car up.
W1NST,If it’s still under warranty get your local dealer to check the battery - mine was replaced under warranty because they fitted a load of lower powered batteries than the required spec accidentally.
Isotope,I'll see what tomorrow brings
wictod,Just checked and mine stays on after I've double tapped the locking button for about 4 - 5 minutes as well..
jwq,parking brake is normal at approx 5 minutes.... You'll also hear the sound of the brakes clunking at that time....It's basially systems shutting down
Isotope,I'm thinking two possibilities caused the problem:-Umbrella jammed in the powergate stopped it closing so car never shut downor can you put the roof/map lights on forever and get out with them still on?Car is working as expected today!
Deman77,"It would not double beep and would not fold the mirrors if it refused to lock. I get that sometimes when kids don’t close the doors properly. You know smth is off even if you are not thinking - that double beep is so annoying you always cringe in expectation and when it’s not there your brain is asking what’s wrong,"
Isotope,I have also noticed a third beep when the bonnet is open using the charger today. Hopefully it was the Umberella stopping the powergate?
Deman77,I stuck mine on ctek yesterday to see how effective car charging is. It did end up with higher initial off charge voltage (12.72) - see last cycle in screen shot than from car charging (12.55) - all previous cycles.It was on ctek for 3 hours whereas my trips are fairly short (30min typically) so it just not long enough even though charging voltage from the car is higher than what ctek pumps out (and I was using higher voltage AGM charging cycle on ctek because it was sub 5c).It is still not as high as off charge battery voltage than even from car charging in summer where I see 12.80+ and sometimes over 13v after long trips. So battery is just not taking that much charge in cold. But this difference is probably around 3-4 idle days at most and I have seen my battery happily sit there for over two weeks in the airport car park in summer whilst I was on holiday and the car was starting from 12.2v even after that.In this weather I idled the car for 9 days recently and saw it drop to 12.07 and it sat at that voltage quite happily and there were no cranking problems. To get from 12.2 to 12.07 in summer would take another 10-15 days I’d say as voltage starts dropping really slow after about 6-7 days idle.I would say easily over a month idle in warm weather off full charge and easily three weeks in this weather off full charge. If you are short tripper like me you don’t have full charge it is still easily 2 weeks in this weather.What is important though is that the car battery controller recognises the battery needs charge because scrolling through cold weather charging in detail I see almost never charge throttling strategy applied (charging voltage jumping around through the trip) which happens regularly in summer. It pretty much always throwing full alternator power at it.So definitely no idle drain design issues. If battery gets knackered it is something parasitic and car specific.

,
wictod,"Deman77, where you getting this data from? Is that some battery monitor permanently attached to the car.."
Deman77,Yes the cheap generic Bluetooth one that everyone fits. Best 20 quid you will spend.
wictod,Looks like it works well.. gotta have one of those.. they on Amazon?
alfaitalia,Id ignore those 12.8 and 13v volt reading after a trip....you need to leave the battery to settle for a while to get an accurate reading. 12.7 volts is 100% charged....Id question the accuracy of any reading (after 1/2 an hour sitting) above that.....
Deman77,It’s accurate. The monitor shows CTEK voltage changes exactly how they describe their programs to 0.01v.i agree the off charge battery voltage drops exponentially and very quickly. However it is significant in determining how much charge battery carries relative to another cycle because discharge always follows very similar shape - you can see from the charts. So the higher it starts off charge the slower it reaches those typical voltage metrics. So I rely on that number for relative performance of the battery between cycles and I don’t need to wait 3-4 hours which is quite imprecise too (there 33% difference between 3 and 4). So looking at these numbers I know my battery was fuller after ctek than after typical trip in this weather. I also know I probably cannot expect higher charge than what CTEK gave me no matter how long I will drive around. I also know my battery was fuller after a typical trip in sumner than it is now even after CTEK. I’m not making representations about % as those vary quite a bit between battery models and probably even between particular batteries based on how badly they deteriorated.
Deman77,"Amazon, eBay, AliExpress even if you are happy to wait. Just check that it works with Battery Monitor app, refers to improved Bluetooth (early models had weaker signal). You can fit on existing posts without undoing anything by just adding some extra nuts. Takes 5min and pair with the app. Then figure out where your phone can reach it from. Mine manges from behind one of the windows but depending on your house might need to be outside. But whenever it manages it will take a reading and then tell you once a day do you don’t need to remember to check.Then enable notifications for the app and configure to pester you at low charge. Mine saved me once after a long holiday trip when something decided to drain the battery after I arrived. It was just straight line like the car never shut off. Luckily I passed by the window in the holiday house and it told me battery low. I took for 30min drive and it was fine. Don’t know what it was, could be anything and since it never repeated I don’t care. I just know it saved me from stress on holiday and from getting a deep cycle on nearly new battery."
wictod,Appreciate the explanation... Ordinarily I wouldn't go to these lengths but there's definitely some mystery issues with random battery drain other than the battery is expiring naturally. I've got a booster on board as well if I need it but like the idea of knowing real time where we're at regards the voltage.So reading your other explanation am I right in saying that Summer driving charges the battery fuller than the ctek charging in Winter. Is that due to a slow glide downwards in battery capacity through deep cycles or something to do with the temperature / more stuff running / drawing current in the car? Regardless it looks like we need to periodically use the ctek in Winter to keep it topped up.. hope I've understood that correctly..
Muz,Mine is currently showing 12.39 and 66% but it also says Low power
Deman77,Low temperature temporarily reduces battery capacity.The permanent reduction happens from deep cycling (fast) and age (slowly).I don’t think there is need to use ctek unless the car was not used more than 2 weeks and it’s very cold. If you have a monitor then no guessing - plug it in if it goes below 12.05. That should be very rare. I am on shorter trip side of things and I only plugged in out of curiosity - even when I left it idle for a while it didn’t need to be plugged in as it stabilised around 12.1 and sat there.The Recond CTEK cycle once a year makes sense. I will do mine in spring when temperatures pick up.
Deman77,Ignore the % - it’s not linear and it’s an estimate. Voltage is what it measures and that’s accurate - 12.39 in winter is solid charge. It can probably sit on this for quite a while if you don’t unlock it to drain power.
Muz,I noticed that the guy who did my ceramic coating left the engine running when he was doing the seating and have since done similar if I spend any time with the doors or boot left open.
Deman77,It drains but it’s not heavy enough for you to run the engine. Certainly not for pottering around. I sometimes do deep interior clean waiting for kids on Saturday morning. That’s an hour of opening closing doors and boot. You can see voltage drop - that’s because battery is called upon but it does not drain an awful lot and bounces back to a decent level. By the time I return home (30min drive) the battery charge is back to normal. I only mentioned opening doors because with these computers on wheels it has an impact and done enough times can affect the battery a fair bit.idling is not good for modern engine and I wouldn’t do it for battery sake.
Isotope,Can anyone post a link to the device you are using I can't find it on Amazon?
Isotope,is it this?Battery Monitor BM2 device for Cars & Campervans 12V Battery/leisure battery tester Compatible with Android iOS and Ipad with bluetooth 4.0 and above. : Amazon.co.uk: Automotive
Deman77,Yes looks like one of them. They keep switching the product listing.
Isotope,I presume you bolt it onto the battery clamp posts before the IBS on the negative pole?
Deman77,

Isotope,"Is this screen part of the BM2 app, I can't find the option in the version I now have?"
alfaitalia,Now...just from a battery makers website.
Isotope,"Thanks for the reply, I downloaded the latest version of the app and I was starting to think I was being a bit thick, the colours look almost identical to the alarm notification option screen"
Isotope,It's all fitted now and very re-assuring. What's the trip thing supposed to show in the app?
Muz,"It shows the date, time for the start of drive, time for the end of drive and duration of driveWorryingly my battery was showing 68% yesterday lunch time but I just checked it now and it shows 34% but a charge of 12.20v. Hoping that Denman 77’s comments about ignoring the percentage are right!"
Muz,I had this this morning. I have been walking the dog twice a day (driving to the park) throughout the wet weather we have had recently. I know there is almost certainly moisture in the car from wet coats and a wet dog as well as boots. I have rubber mats for the winter so it’s not getting through to the carpets.Is anyone else getting similar? I don’t get fogged up windows in normal driving conditions and have just bought some silica bags to combat it during this wet and icy weatherI am a little concerned that I might have water getting into the car although It was only the windscreen that had a thin sheet of ice inside.Am I worrying about nothing?I did have this a couple of times last winter but nothing since until today
,
Navlet,Our car us left outside in all weather but no sign of moisture in the car.I think wet clothes and wet dog would indeed cause enough moisture in the cabin leading to condensation on windscreen which could freeze.If carpets are dry in front footwells I woudnt worry.
Mash1138,"Ours had moisture in this morning, no idea where from??"
Muz,"I MAY have solved this. Air circulation was set to manual which I think recirculates the air in the car. I have only ever used this on other cars when in a tunnel or behind a stinking car or lorry.Since I changed it back to auto a few days ago, I haven’t had any issues with moisture or ice on the inside of the windscreenFingers crossed"
Navlet,That could cause condensation if its in manual and closed to recirculate air.
manc350,I have had some misting issues in my 2021 Stelvio even though i have air circulation set to Auto.. today i found the depression where your heel sits when using the brake soaked through.. which is strange because i have not used the car in the rain for some time...Going to set some card up to see if something is dripping from under the steering column.. the wet patch is 3 inches in front of the brake pedal directly under the plastic covers below the steering column.. any ideas ?Cheers !

That can cause leakage into the car
manc350,Will take a look .. last time I looked it was ok but I was scooping copious amounts of snow out of it.. but that was about 3 weeks back !
Muz,"I noticed tonight that the only interior lights I get in the dark when I get in the car are the footwell lights, no overhead courtesy lights though.Checked the manual and see that I have to press overhead button 4, which was illuminated when I start the car. I pressed it and the light on the number 4 button goes off.When I turn the engine off, get out of the car and lock it the interior lights go out quite quickly. However if I don’t lock the car the front and rear courtesy lights as well as the door handle lights all stay on. I waited 5 mins and they were still on. Good way to flatten the battery if I hadn’t noticed this difference from locking and not locking the car.Am I being stupid, have I missed something, or do I have an electrical fault?"
,
joephoto,"Sounds like you may have a fault, or more likely, the setting for how long the interior lights stay on is set incorrectly. There are three modes for turning off the overhead lighting:1. When all doors are closed after entering the vehicle, the three-minute timer will stop and a seconds timer will start for the interior lights. This timing will stop when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN position.2. When doors are locked (either with key fob or with key inserted on driver side door), the overhead light turns off.3. The interior lights will turn off after 15 minutes to preserve the battery.It looks like you are set for Option 2, as my '21 Stelvio (US model) operates per Option 1."
Isotope,"I had a flat battery this weekend and I think I made the overhead lights stay on after exiting the vehicle. Today I noticed I had no overhead lights and one of the buttons in the roof was yellow? Not the Airbag notification, I pressed the yellow button and all is back to how I expect when getting in and out of the car, turning the ignition on and off etc."
joephoto,There is also a setting buried somewhere to let you change the interior lighting mode.
Maximus84,"Wait, you have footwell lights...!?"
joephoto,Doesn’t everyone? 🤣
Isotope,"Even the passenger has footwell lights!I also have front footwell lights drivers side, centre cup holder and door pocket lights in the MY21 car, then there's the outer door handle lights! They stay on for like ever untill you lock the car. Internal top down submarine lights have gone from red to white LED's since the Giulietta and the internal roof lights are really brilliant during entry and egress!"
Maximus84,Hmm.... I have the roof and door handle ambient lighting but nothing in the footwell. I did think it strange as my Giulia had footwell lighting... will need to investigate!
Alfie155,My MY19 Milano has footwell lighting but I assume it is part of the ambient lighting package ie separate from the overhead interior lighting. You can access ambient lighting through Lighting in the menu and it can be set to Off or Level 1 to Level 5. Further it only functions when the dipped beams are turned on. Incidentally there is no discernable difference in brightness between level 1 and level 5. The door handle (exterior) lights are separate again and are switchable through the Menu.
Maximus84,"Mine's a special and doesn't have the exterior door handle lights, which I believe is because it doesn't have keyless entry. Shame, as my Giulia had both, and it was useful.I checked and the ambient lighting was set at '5'. Odd."
Jambo,"Morning, perhaps a silly question, or not?But is the Geolocation function on the current Stelvio recognised as a tracking device by insurance companies?"
,
Deman77,There is a tracking service you can subscribe to for 50-60/year that is recognised as a tracker by both admiral and LV for me.
Muz,Which one is that? MyAlfaConnect also do one but it’s £96 a year or £9 a month. There is also a five year one for £320 but not sure I’ll keep the car that long
Deman77,Correct on AlfaConnect. Is it as much as that? Thought it was 60 or so.
Deman77,Ok I checked it says “blocked price” on my sub but it is annual. I assume that’s euro English for fixed renewal price. That’s probably why it was lower for me.
Muz,"Indeed, I had a blocked price of £80 renewable on 03 Jan. I got the invoice and then the next day they cancelled it. I am now going through the very frustrating and long winded process with customer service to find out why.The staff are always very pleasant but absolutely incapable of sorting anything without referring it and then the conversation has to start from scratch with every escalation. It’s wearing and very irritating"
Jambo,thanks for the help - good info to know for costs playing off against insurance renewal that appears to have jumped from c.500 to 650-750£supposedly there are no new customer only deals now either - so a different search activity this year
Deman77,Admiral were always best for me for years. Always higher every year as is customary even with maxed out ncb. Would obviously need a ring when they jack it up too high. They were best again for when QV was new but come renewal they wanted 50% more and they couldn’t get anywhere near LV which was lower than all the dodgy offshore insurers too. I am bracing for a chunky hike later this year when renews as muddy water with rule changes and inflation going through the roof is obviously a good excuse to hike and if they all do it together we just have to lump it.
Jambo,"Agree - I'm with Admiral now and have been bouncing between them and Aviva for the past few years. LV, Direct Line, have never been competative.Shopping new customer deals has been a frustrating event every year - receiving the envelope and ""ffs they've done it again!""But its us that do shop around that will be hit as there were always those that didn't and paid more. Now that is spread across us all and the ones that do not shop around in fact benefit.Its a completely different approach to the energy industry where we are told to shop around or lose out. (exception to the joke situation of energy today).At the end of the day its rather little a problem - the cost of a few bottles of nice gin that wound never last for an annual renewal."
Jambo,Just came across Darwin Insurance (new since 2019 - part of the direct line group).Very competative 30% less than the best other renewal i have from Admiral multicar on my Stelvio.Would mean setting up individual policies - but they quote very similar on my wife's Giulietta.I'm checking Darwin out - they appear all good if you are happy to manage the account online.Would mean a saving close on £300 on the renewal of both cars!
Jambo,haAdmiral just matched it within £15 - The discount game still exists!

stevemacqueen,Exactly right. I haven’t got high beam assist. Same message again this morning
stevemacqueen,"Many thanks for the link. Having bought this car used in Oct 2020 from an independent dealer I was now interested to study the relevant price list. The dealer knew little about Alfa so I got it at a knock down price including sun roof, metallic paint, HK sound and roof rails non standard extras. It would appear that I should have auto high beam because it is in the driver assistance pack the other features of which I do have. Therefore it is possible the high beam is there but not working hence the error message. I will have to get an Alfa dealer to look into it.At the same time the rear screen demist appears not to work. It's all very confusing and typically Alfa."

VeloceRosso,"Nothing like that but on the app today, all of my fuel has disappeared and I filled it the other day and have only driven 30 miles!Bit of a useless app anyway."
GVblue,"Our Stelvio is now eighteen months old and apart from an electrical glitch, which I put down to a low charged battery when the car was delivered, it has been great. Until tonight when I think that early glitch may have been something more sinister.About 9.00 tonight a rather grumpy neighbour knocked on the door to inform me that the Stelvio alarm was going off, although the hazards weren't flashing. I knew straight away, with the alarm not functioning as it should, that it was a battery issue and, sure enough, it was pretty flat yet the interior lights and handbrake light were on and did not go out.So the question is, did the lights not extinguish themselves when I came home in the car at 2.00 this afternoon and quickly run the battery down or did they stay on as one of the strange things these cars do when the battery goes flat?With my wife working from home the car does not get a lot of use but I do CTEK my cars regularly and the Stelvio always charges up very quickly.The battery is now disconnected from the car and on charge but I doubt my CTEK will rescue it now so it looks like a call to recovery in the morning.This is particularly disappointing as I had been singing the car's praises all afternoon for the way it had tackled the mini blizzard that had just hit my part of Derbyshire, blocking many roads and stranding many vehicles.."
,
VeloceRosso,"That’ll interesting. Apart from an over sensitive alarm sensor, I have only had one problem with mine when battery died whilst on holiday in June. Car had been stood idle for 2 days. Rescue came out, jumped it (after saying it was utterly flat despite having driven 400 miles in the 2 days prior) but since then it’s not failed but nearly always shows low voltage on the battery monitor gadget everyone seems to fit.I have noticed that sometimes when the car is parked up, the led next to the handbrake is still on hours after it’s been parked.With you mentioning the handbrake light, I wonder if this is a similar thing.Dealer wasn’t playing ball when it came to swapping battery under warranty unless I left the car with them for 2 days while they “tested it” so I gave up."
pocholin,"Looks like time for a new battery, AGM is the better way to go. When the battery in my 2020 QV started acting up (recently) I didn't even waste time going to the dealer looking for warranty replacement, I paid ~200 American dollars and replaced it myself."
VeloceRosso,Yes that’s what I’m going to do if mine fails again.I work for a battery company so can get one at staff price.

Isotope,"Must admit when I had the 147 I had a front wheel puncture and it took a lot of kicking of the wheel to free it off tochange.Itsprobably a disimilar metal problem, betweeen the alloys and the steel hub/disc.

wictod,The corrosion was wire brushed off from the mating surfaces and copper slip applied.. If there's a good reason not to do that I'll get it cleaned off... cheers
wictod,maybe it's specific to this type of wheel... ?
alfaitalia,Common occurrence no matter what make of car or model. The steel hub corrodes to the alloy wheel. Copper slipping those surfaces with a very thin layer or copper slip or other anti-seize will stop it happening again.....just don't put it on the bolts. Kicking the tyre hard IN TOWARDS the car will usually break it free if it does happen. I would never happen on mine as I take the wheels off two or three times a year to clean the backs of them and jet wash under the arches.....

Last one I recall was a Land Rover Freelander which had the service bulletin updated to include this. Has no bearing on the fastness of the wheels whatsoever. As mentioned above though, never on the wheel bolt threads. Still come across this now and again in some garages. Specifically not recommended by some manufacturers, as they know it happens, I think it was Nissan the last time I read that somewhere, and that can have an adverse affect on bolt surety."
cue2,In theory the wheels might be removed for checks to brakes or rotation of tyres at the annual service but I’m sure they’re not.
alfaitalia,Brakes are usually checked through the spokes and from the back unless there are issues. Tyre rotation is a thing of the past for most....unless you have a 4x4 like my last Grand Cherokee where having tyres of differing rolling circumference of more than a few mil front to rear can damage the transfer case. I used to rotate the wheels (a five tyre rotate like below) every three months but I was doing quite a lot of mileage at the time. You need non directional tyres to do this though.
wictod,"Car serviced 25th February 2021Tyres changed 26th February 2021 (last time I know for sure the wheels were off)Car serviced 29th November 2021Brakes changed under observation sections from service 15th December 2021Less than a year but 10,000 miles since tyres changed.."
cue2,"Exactly. A friend with a GTV , far enough in the past for him to be the first owner, was surprised that after the third service the wheels were almost impossible to remove. He’d assumed the wheels would have been removed by then.There are suggestions that loosening the bolts and driving the car around will undo the electrochemical “glue”."
Jetronic77,"Done that with truck wheels... but not on the public road, just on the courtyard in front of the workshop. works super and beats hammering off the heavy wheels from the pit."
cue2,looking on howmanyleft shows the rare models and it’s not the Quadrifoglio.
,
Alfie155,"I've no idea what the TD4x2 Auto is but there's only 2 of them. I assume it's the 2-wheel drive only version so wouldn't have the Q4 badge on the back, being the only way of identifying it. Does anyone on here own one of them?."
cue2,"I think it’s theoretical “price point“ model, now gone. It’s in the early brochure."
wictod,At what point in 2021 did the Specialie morph into the Veloce or are they different?
Muz,"JanuarJanuary 2020, I have one of the first registered in the UK. Updated infotainment, leather gear knob, leather dash and armrests and tops. Ipad charging point, etc etc"
cue2,"The Sprint replaced the Speciale, I’d say."
cue2,Except that the 210 diesel didn’t make it from Speciale to Sprint. Only available on the Veloce.
wictod,"The Sprint petrol version looks to be only 200bhp version.. Specialie was 280bhp mind you I get really confused with these options.. especially when you get into the ""packs"" details etc"
cue2,I was impressed when the John Lewis insurance call centre man pronounced Speciale correctly when I called for the renewal. The 210 diesel and 280 petrol have obviously been saved as a reason to get a Veloce but when I considered changing to one it was no more expensive than a Sprint on monthly figures.
wictod,"That is impressive, wonder whether he would pronounced Giulia corr3ectly if you had one of those.."
Deman77,How can one pronounce Giulia incorrectly? Thought it was just spelling people struggled with.
cue2,"A hard G , like Gweeliar. I’ve heard it and even seen it spelled phonetically like that here."
alfaitalia,"Nope...as a half Italian!....Giulia is pronounced “Joo-Lee-Uh”; basically, it's just like the English name “Julia.” Giulia is a girl's name in Italian, coming from Italian and Latin origin meaning, “youthful.”"
JTD_Liam,"Speciale was replaced with Lusso TI and that was quickly dropped, so there's effectively no direct replacement for Speciale now.You either go down to Sprint and lose the more powerful engine choices or up to Veloce to get the 210bhp diesel or 280bhp petrol. When they did the revisions to the dashboard and equipment levels, trim levels switched from base, Super, Speciale, Milano/TI, to Super, Sprint, Lusso TI, Veloce, before Super & Lusso TI were quickly deleted.Veloce is the effective replacement for Milano Edition and the short lived TI. Veloce TI is a new trim to close the gap between the core range and Quadrifoglio."
cue2,The Milano was effectively the “Launch Edition” offered at the Speciale price most of the time. The Lusso Ti did not come with the more powerful engines which were available with the Speciale but gained the Lusso pack of wood trims etc as standard so resale values could reflect a specific list price. They ended up being preregistered it would appear.Most of us 0% Italians know that but some go for a “hard G” just to be awkward!
ban1111,nope.. basically the English name Julia is like the Italian/Latin and proper name Giulia
cue2,It even gets translated from Giulia to Julia on Google translate.
Per1,"I gather the loud clunking sound (or a bit like the wheel skipping/hopping) is quite normal - fat tyres and all, but what causes it? Is it the steering geometry?

jwq,see also official bulletin from Alfa :
Per1,"Cheers guys - I had heard that it was the Ackermann Angle and grateful that you have confirmed it to be so, and the bulletin is good to have had a read of 👍👍"
GVblue,"Weird thing is, I get it on our Giulia but not on our Stelvio"
jwq,different tires perhaps
Isotope,"I used to get it on the 2017 Giulia, but thought the new Stelvios had done away with it. My MY21 Stelvio has the same characteristics. Tight lock generates the same sound but I thought Alfa had given up on Ackemann geometry due to customer complaints (lack of technical knowledge) last year?"
Isotope,its a really strange noise like your car has knobbly tyres when you obviously don't on full lock!
Deman77,I think that’s a myth. It was only mentioned once by a dealer who needed to make a case to@Multo Benethat his my21 giulia QV steering he hated was as expected. I think it was a fib.Qv owners of my20/21 still have skipping on summer oem tyres. Other models would probably only not experience it because they might be on comfort focused softer compound tyres from factory.
jwq,"As said, I think it was just hearsay.....Why give up on an essentialy good system, used by lots of other high performance brands....."
alfaitalia,My wifes A Class suffers from the same thing....pretty embarrassing in a multi story or anywhere else with a shinyish floor....makes you sound like a hooligan screeching about!! But its only happening a very low speeds.
alfaitalia,All cars have the Ackerman effect (its need to compensate for the fact that on a corner the inside wheel needs to make a tighter circle than the outside one......turn ANY car to full lock on one side and the inner wheel will have turned further than the outer....that Ackerman geometry in effect)...but the reason its more noticeable on some cars inc the Giulia and Stelvio is the acute Ackerman angles employed to enhance driving experience. A price worth paying though.
Isotope,You will also notice it more in the colder ambient temperatures as the rubber tyres aren't as compliant when warm!
Jetronic77,"It's lack of Ackermann that causes this, or too much. The only way to get no sounds is to have fairly good Ackermann. Tyres with enough flexibility in the thread can mask it, or tyres with low friction can reduce the banging."
Jetronic77,Absolutely!
sheepapple,"Hello all.While reversing on a dirt road, I nudged a tree and snapped a few bumper and arch moulding clips/slides. Super glad the they are really soft and break easily, else the bumper might have caved and I'd have probably had a nervous breakdown! Comp Rosso! The PPF thankfully did its job really well.The bumper does need to be re-positioned though. It's moved about 2-3mm and needs to be pulled slightly back.I really don't want to do any more damage while re-seating everything. Does anyone have a video or instructions on how to correctly strip the moulding and bumper? My Google-fu doesn't seem to yield any results.I'd also be happy to hear any other thoughts or advice on the matter.Thanks everyone."
,
cue2,Hopefully the bumper support mountings are intact and the sacrificial clips have done their job. If you look on eBay you can probably see what’s on the back of the bumper.
Mash1138,Hithe live updates have always been intermittent. But now seem to have gone forever??Any ideas.Cheers Mash

jwq,what do you mean with live updates ?
Mash1138,"Traffic delays, roadworks, accidents etc. As you get on standard Tom Tom or Google Maps/Waze ??"

Jimbon1973,"I've been busy contacting a whole host of dealers to try and sort a Stelvio TI for next June.Apart from the usual very average sales service from most of them (sorry we're not ordering cars for 2022 yet, can you call back in January) one dealer has told me there's going to be some pretty big changes to the Stelvio line up for 2022. The TI is going and there's a lot of change to the spec in Sprint, Veloce (adds LSD & Auto high beam, hands free tail, speaker system down to 8 speakers).Has anyone ordered a Stelvio TI for 2022?"
,
cue2,I think you’ll find any salesman more interested in their current month‘s target than that far ahead. Alfa is being positioned more carefully under the new Stellantis management to maximise margins more rather than piling them high. By that time the idea of every car being a customer order may have become reality as part of the agency sales model. Some dealers may not be in the system any more.
wictod,Was shooting the breeze with service manager this morning at one of their dealers.. he says they're having trouble getting hold of new Alfas at the moment with extended lead times and the second hand market is just as scarce.. whether the latter reflects a good resale I don't know.
cue2,I had the same response from the service department at Ancaster a couple of weeks ago. Seems likely from the Italian websites.
manc350,That bears out across manufacturers.. my wife looking to replace company car in March 2022... Audi and Merc quoting June / July for factory builds of the models she wants.... he company unwilling to extend current car as she already extended by 12 months so it will be 4 years old.. going to be a case of what is available at the time I think.

wictod,"Recently got recommended some videos on youtube regarding battery post corrosion on the Stelvio.. I think we're all aware how sensitive some of the systems are to battery voltage etc so worth a look at the video.I haven't checked mine yet to be fair but this dealer in the US is explaining some of the issues that he's seen with brand new shipped units to the States whereby they spend a long time in transit with exposure to salt air etc. And often throw up a few errors with only a few miles on the clock due to corrosion.I just ordered some post cleaners and dielectric grease to put round the posts and will check and do the procedure. My cars getting on a bit now, done 35k miles and think it's a good preventative maintenance check to negate any issues like this creeping up on you.."
,
alfaitalia,LOL.....poor old you....I'm amazed its lasted this long!!! Its only just about run in!!
wictod,"yeah silly comment... What I should of said is, it's getting to the stage where things need replacing, having said that, and I don't want to tempt fate, I'm surprised how robust this car is compared to the GTV 3.0 I had for twenty years. The amount of things swapped out during that period far exceeded what has to be done on the Stelvio.."
cue2,"Weird comment about age of car. An acquaintance told me this morning he’s trading in his second car , a Mini Countryman , which is still under warranty. He’s had two major cost repairs. Like £1800 for the air con condenser!And yet he’s getting a BMW to replace it."

Mathew Rudd,
,
alfaitalia,That's great and all that.....but with roads like they are at the moment it will look the same as it did at the start in about three days!! I might consider it in the summer (if I had the money to ...erm....waste?....waste seems a bit harsh....but I could get nearly a good a result myself).....but not in the depths of winter. Looked great when finished though and I really don't do green!
cue2,You’re missing out on the bonding with the car experience but hopefully the work protects the car.
Mathew Rudd,I very much disagree...there were loads of factory induced sanding marks and holograms.....its crystal clear now....and yes roads at the moment are terrible but the ceramic coating will last 5 years if maintained which I wash my car twice amonth.moneywell spent in my eyes
Mathew Rudd,Oh I have bonded with the car alot already only picked up car last day of October and done almost 2kmileage.wasonly away for three days
amfalconer,"Take it this wasn't the firm revving the nuts off it, as per your earlier post?"
Deman77,I suspect your swirling was your or the dealer contractor doing.My detailer commented that paintwork was in superb state from factory with almost no correction needed. But I did pre-agree no washing on PDI and it went to the detailer a few days after collection to minimise damage.
Mathew Rudd,Haha definitely not them
Mathew Rudd,"I never washedthe car,yes it was taken to some polish contractor near beechdale"
Deman77,"it protects clear coat and is a little harder than uncoated clear coat so it will be less swirly over time. My coated Alfa has a lot less propensity to pick up an occasional mini scuff than uncoated bmw. For mini swirls you can only tell the difference with specialist equipment close up or in a very strong sunshine. When washed and dried with correct techniques both look great and both look better still with LSP applied. Mine are both bright colours and those look clean very long time and also look great after cleaning. Take a dark car and bad washing techniques and I suspect ceramic will make a lot more difference.the downside of ceramic is that you cannot just polish off a scratch or a scuff, the whole panel needs to be polished and recoated. With touch up chip repair if you polish to blend in you will remove ceramic on the area. Also ceramic keeps more water in those pretty fat beads on horizontal surfaces (on angled surfaces they just roll off) than uncoated car and that dries quite unsightly in summer months. Rain does not roll off easily because there is simply not enough water flow to sheet. But if you splash water out of a bucket or open hose you can basically make 95% of it run off if you car is clean."
Mekerz,"Looks great! Don't listen to those who say you've wasted money, it's your money and I don't see any issue splashing out a couple of K to protect a car that's probably £70k+.I know if I take my hourly work rate and multipled that by the hours the detailer spent on my Giulia, it would have cost me much more money than I paid. Plus whilst I'm OCD when it comes to cleaning my car, I don't have the experience the detailer I used has when it come to leveling out coatings, I don't have access to those coatings and I don't have experience with applying PPF either.I had my Veloce paint corrected, coated with professional grade ceramic and PPF to the full front and A pillars. It really makes a difference! The paint finish form factory wasn't great and I saw lots of issues with the clear coat and that wasn't even going over it closely, now the paint is level and shiny.I can't even describe what it's like to wash the car now, it's like the mitt just glides and you can see the protection in action with how the water and suds come off the panel. I also gave the interior leather a good clean with LRC cleaner, followed by the protection cream - really recommend this stuff, especially as it has a leather scent to it."
cue2,"The main benefit for the detailed, other than extensive experience, is the ability to work indoors as many of the products need to be left to cure. I get pretty good results with Swissvax applied by hand in the outdoors. Great fun driving in the rain with the beading on the bonnet!"
amfalconer,"Just watched it this morning, hadn't realised ,but I'd seen this chap's channel before, he seems to do a great job.It said you drove 5hrs to get there....

wictod,Nothing like the attention to detail that the OP has had done to that beautiful Green machine but I am really impressed with the Fusso coat I have been using... still beading and very easy to wash ...
Deman77,One of my favourite pass times. any car really but with Stelvio it’s another level. Real joy to wash.

AmicusPro,"Worth looking into an OBD reader just in case there is an underlying issue, even if it's a glitch - if it causes the ""issue"" to re-appear then you can think about narrowing it down to a cause (though never a guarantee). Garages will let you do it for anywhere between free and £60, or you can buy anything from a full-on plug ""domestic"" device or a bluetooth dongle that talks to your mobile phone. Everyone has their own opinions (and I wouldn't mind paying a garage if they could justify the £50-60 easily enough) on what you should or shouldn't pay for. I went with a cheap Amazon one (OBD2 Bluetooth Scanner Code Reader Reset for Android Windows, Auto Car Diagnostic Scan Tool OBDII Adapter for Check Engine Light) that cost just under £10. I only got around to using it on holiday this year and it wouldn't connect. Tried all the usual and got a different device working on the car. They sent a replacement within a week foc. You can use free apps or you can pay. I have previously bought the Windows App of Car Scanner for about £3. It gives you access to a number of readings from the car though I've not had a proper play yet and, if nothing else, means I can go to a garage and say ""this is the fault"", not ""I don't know what is wrong, so here's £60 before you even start."
cue2,I refuse to buy an OBD reader for a car I’ve bought new and is still under warranty!
AmicusPro,"That's fine if it's not going to cost you, but I've never really been in a position (read that as I have other priorities for my income) to buy a new car. I'd certainly not bin it in case it helped with any issues that started (e.g. if it keeps kicking out errors, what better way to take it to them than to go armed with the evidence... It's not unreasonable for a car to last x years before developing fault x). Yes, I am overly-simplifying things, but I'm sure you get the drift!"
cue2,The warranty on my car is 5 years.
stelviowner,If I bought an OBD reader I wouldn't know which hole to stick it in what to do with it once it was there and how to interpret any result I happened to get. Horses for courses where I'm concerned. Any garage bloke would see through me in an instant if I tried to act knowledgable. All I really want is a car that just gets on with its job. I can't see Alfa tipping you off about any low cost fix however temporary. At the very least it helps dig you out at the time. A little bit of paper tucked into the handbook with the heads up about some easy techno tricks would be a nice addition to the new owner pack. I'm sure they will never do it but that is a shame. When you drive a computer with an Alfa badge all the help is gratefully accepted and having to find the easy fix from a forum is a pity when it can save you a shed load of money. And because it was a great benefit to me to be tipped off in that way I though it only proper to share the knowledge around. If I'm lucky maybe someone will respond with another get you out of trouble tip that can help me out in the future.
AmicusPro,"I didn't know where it needed to be so I did a little searching (I'll admit to being more technical than mechanically minded). For the 159 it's to the right of the steering wheel with the fuse box. Hardest bit was taking the cover off because I'm ham-fingered! The software gives you some knowledge (e.g. it's not just a number it's something like ""low boost pressure""). You don't have to give a full diagnosis to the mechanic, just list the symptoms (if any), the outcome (e.g. limp mode) and the error. Anyway, I realise it's not for everyone - my parents wouldn't choose to use one but then they don't really do smart phones at all either (not saying you don't, just pointing out that we're all different)Ultimately, glad the situation was resolved and hopefully it never happens again!"
AmicusPro,That's nice... Not sure if I needed to know that ;-) I was giving a generalised answer

stelviowner,"Do you remember when your throttle was controlled by a cable, needed a bit of oil every couple of years. You got pissed off if it stuck occasionally. Not such a problem now is it."
stelviowner,"I had a stupid a short time ago where my infotainment controls froze. Ignition off and on made no difference and I was unwilling to pay the dealers diagnosis fee for what was probably going to be a simple fix. Had the equipment been around the house I would simply had turned it off and on again therefore I applied the same logic to the car and I pulled the negative terminal off the battery ( it simply unplugs ) left it a moment and reconnected it. Apart from the car moaning at me for a short while it survived. The infotainment issue went away and no further problems. So apparently if you get an electronic glitch on your Stelvio you can indeed disconnect/reconnect your battery and survive. All I lost was my trip data from the dash, a minor issue. ."
cue2,Cars nowadays are computers so a “power-cycle” may work to fix them.
leeannhahn,It was driver side module A fuel pump that had to be replaced. $800ish later and not a single issue since!
stelviowner,At least Alfa's are reliable in that any repair will be eye wateringly expensive.
cue2,Are you suggesting Alfa parts prices are higher than other car’s parts?
stelviowner,Twenty quid for a set of ALFA tyre valve caps would tend to suggest that yes Alfa parts can be priced for the discerning but monied owner. This Coupled with the lack of dealerships can make Alfa ownership a challenge.
cue2,They are not spare parts. They are not needed but some owners like their cars so much they want to put them on.

The car performed perfectly for the remainder of the holiday which totalled 1200 miles, and has still to put another foot wrong.Thank christ for the forum and the advice, who would ever have dreamt that the fault was a software glitch and the five engine starts were all it took to remedy things. Could have cost a fortune to trouble shoot that one only to spend out on a great big nothing.Alfas are fun to drive and different to own but you do need a sense of humour."

You know you are not shopping at the economy end of the market. Are Alfas costly to own? They certainly can be. And regarding the battery disconnect earlier. I was unsure as to the consequences of that. Did cross my mind that I might need a laptop to start it again but thankfully no. At least I did not need to confront the £95.00 'diagnosis fee' which my local dealer is delighted to impose. It would not cross their mind to do a quick simple fix and sent a customer on their way happy to be back in business and relieved to be not charged to the hilt. My usual independant garage has in the past done light bulb changes for me and just sent me on my way. 'Go on with you, the bulbs a couple of quid and you're a regular customer' they said. Goes a long way with me."

I will stick to my own example of £305.00 to repair a number plate light which was out. Turned out to be a corroded connector. As the car is only 4 years old it is disappointing to encounter a corrosion based fault.
cue2,I could say that the valve cap price is a dozen miles depreciation at the rate I use mine. I don’t know how much I’d have lost on the alternative cars I could’ve had but I only wanted a new Stelvio. I didn’t need to change my Giulietta Speciale but I did.What are the circumstances of your massive bill for a number plate lamp? My dealer would probably have replaced if it was faulty. Sounds like it was.When my battery went flat during lockdown a repair guy appeared very quickly and recharged it outside our house.
stelviowner,Three weeks out of warranty. The guy charged the full diagnostic and the repair fee. The fault put a message onto the dash 'check number plate light'. Turned out to be a corroded connector. The fault has been fixed now.
cue2,When my first Giulietta was the same time out of warranty the tailgate wiring failed on one wire. When the dealer told me it’d be £800 I said I didn’t think so. As I’d owned it from new and had a full service history the repair was free on goodwill. Not easy as it was just before the August shutdown so the claim started with Italy and ended with Fiat U.K.
stelviowner,"Latest trick?? Speedo not working. Put the car to bed, it was fine. In the morning we set out and the speedo didn't move, didn't do anything. Over time as we went along it gradually came back to life, creeping higher up the clock until finally after half an hour or so it was reading somewhere near the mark. Probably another electrical connection fault but can I trust it to read anything like true now? Who knows. Never saw that one coming."
wictod,"Just had my Stelvio serviced at a main dealer (won't name them at this point until I've spoken with them again) hopefully after some advice from this forum..So basically the price of the service was £624.00 including the courtesy vehicle..When I turned up to pick the car up.. I quickly scanned the inventory of parts etc and queried the oil on the list.. I expected Selenia Digitiek but the line item for the oil was ""Total ST C3 5w 30"" . The service advocate said... oh yeah that's wrong.. it's listed as that but it's actually Selenia Digitek.. So sort of accepting that he scored out the line and had wrote ""Selenia Digitek""When I got home i ckecked it again against the previous service from the same place and they had another ambiguous line item saying ""drum 0w30 200L.. I remember at the time querying this but they convinced me I had Selenia in it... that line item was £62.40 which is probably about right for the Selenia.. The line item cost for this ""Total ST C3 5w30"" is £20.90????As well as that, no spark plugs are listed on the inventory? I thought they were part of the 36K Stelvio Service..So i'm going to have a chat with them tomorrow about this but if they insist everything is ok and i've got Selenia in there, is there anyway I can check this as I'm not confident that particular oil is in my car?I think I'll go independent specialist next time.."
,
cue2,"Your car is a Multiair? The oil used should not be from the drum of sieved stuff known in the trade as the “pot of gold” due to its incredible profitability, My first Giulietta MA got the wrong oil put in by a main dealer but when I checked Alfa customer services told them to collect it and change it for the correct stuff. The handbook gives a mileage that should not be exceeded with the wrong oil."
wictod,"Thanks Cue... my car is 2.0L 280 Specialie ... as far as I'm aware it needs to be the Selenia Digitek 0w 30.. What I can't get my head around even if it's a genuine mistake is why the parts list states the wrong oil on two occasions.. this time I think i've been sold the wrong stuff because of the price... surely they must realise Alfa owners are OCD about this sort of thing? Furthermore, they have advised that front and back discs and pads are needed very soon but quote for that work is £1050.00.. I know nothings cheap these days but seems a bit pricey to me."
pocholin,"It seems Alfa has the same ""repair"" policy than Volvo...when pads need replacing it is time to replace discs as well, regardless of how good/bad they look. At 36k miles your disc rotors should not need to be replaced. I would suggest taking a rear tire off and checking the disc thickness, I bet is hasn't even worn one millimeter off in total thickness...if so, ask Alfa to quote just the pad replacement. If they say they don't do that (like Volvo did to me at two different dealers), I would suggest you do it yourself or take it to an independent mechanic.I replaced all pads on my V90 Volvo at 26k miles because of this, same discs were still in the car when I got rid of it at 68k miles and only had 0.9mm wear...which was still far from the minimum thickness."
Deman77,"Volvo main dealer only recommended and did pads on my xc90 when rears wore off. So it’s not a manufacturer policy - it’s a easy job eager dealer.It is not a given that the pads will always go first and discs will be fine. It depends on the disc and the pad and how brakes are worked too. But on road use car it should probably just be pads.I would expect them to have told you what the wear is - new, current, minimum style measures on both disc and pad. It’s not like they are asking for 30 to change windscreen wipers.I do not like the sound of your dealer. I would stay away from them. Don’t let them do anything else - just go somewhere else and write off the money. If they are pulling those stunts with oil on you they may easily be fitting non oem filters or not changing them. Any remedial work - how can you trust they do it right now. I would name them too. Even if they fix the issue people should be weary and check everything with that one."

Muz,i thought the Stelvio had a chain not a belt? Well the petrol ones anyway
Pandra,Thought this would make that little space a bit more usable. I couldn't find anything existing so had to have it made up. Surprised Alfa didn't think of it. Most manufacturers put them on the accessories list for a stupid amount of cash.
,
joephoto,Good idea. Amazon has the item in the link that does almost the same thing.Rear Trunk Organizer Side Divider Board Logo Emblem Badge Sticker Compatible with Alfa Romeo Stelvio 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Accessorieshttps://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08MZLR...abc_573QHJH84JGVYJG7V6WS?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
Pandra,"I hadn't seen that, but then I was searching for nets. It's an option certainly, the only downsides I can see are that it limits the size of any items to what will fit over the edge of the board, whereas the net will flex to accommodate more. Plus the 'velcro' fixing might not resist too much abuse, whereas the net is screwed through the trim with spire nuts on the reverse, so can take a lot more strain. Not that I would choose to strain it too much, but, you know, small differences.But I think the clincher for me would be the large motive in the middle. Not sure why they would think that every piece of aftermarket tat needs a logo, just cheapens it for me. But that part is just personal opinion, I know some folks like logo's everywhere. Good to have a choice though"
JnL,"Really odd that Alfa did not think about that, even more when you think that this is a SUV where you are supposed to transport material/stuff in your boot."
wictod,"Got a bit of an issue with the driver side bonnet catch mechanism, twice it has come adrift from fully shut after seemingly closing properly.. thought I had bonnet warp like the fuel flap the first time.. there's no warning indicator on the dash either.Is this a simple adjustment to maintain it's locked position or shall I just add it to the list for the service that's due in 1000 miles?Cheers"
,
SteveeGee,"I’ve got the opposite problem, have to pry mine open after releasing the catch. I haven’t tried to adjust it, it’s on the list of issues for its 1st service next week."
wictod,Think I'll save it for the dealer to fix then.. I think there's a sensor on them as well.. cheers
Navlet,"Just found this on our Stelvio Speciale.I popped the bonnet last week to charge battery, it took 3 attempts pulling the release handle inside the car to open it as it was stuck on near side.Yesterday I was washing it and noticed the offside had popped up, I pressed it down and it seated properly. I have driven to the North East this week and it must have popped open during the 350 mile round trip but never noticed.The bonnet does seem rather flimsy as if it is warped anyone else had this ?"
jwq,"It is fairly lightweight of course, which might contribute to this (carbon on the QV, alluminium on other models......"
Deman77,"Pretty sure it’s aluminium on Stelvio QV.I either have the same problem exacerbated by slightly misfit front bumper or just bumper misfit. Will get my dealer to look at at first service in a couple of weeks.Additionally, you can make it rattle a little around hinges if you put a towel on the bonnet and try to dry it."
Navlet,"Had a go at trying to see whats going on with our bonnet but couldnt find any obvious reason why the drivers side pops up from being closed.Played around with the bump stops but they were screwed in as far as they would go so I cant get it to go lower. It's really annoying me now as the panel gap looks biggger on that side and I hate wonky shut lines - looks cheap. Ive taken to getting out the car and pressing it down whenever I park up as it bugs me and spoils what is otherwise perfect.Also, I believe the manual says to close the bonnet just drop it from a small height and let gravity make it drop and shut, mine just stays put !It only seems to have become an issue since the temps dropped but that could be a coincidence."

( Covid no doubt )Spoke to the dealer 30 mins ago and will send some pics to them tomorrow for them to look at the cable which runs to the latch which could be the cause. I have to say the dealer is excellent  but over an hour away ."
cue2,Sounds like it just wasn’t opened enough times! Hopefully it just needs greasing and the two catches are needed for the weight saving material used.
Navlet,"Took the Stelvio to the main dealer today to get the bonnet latch replaced due to bonnet popping up on the drivers side.Two weeks ago I sent them photos of the bonnet and latch and they said it needed a new latch, which was duely ordered. It was booked in today at 8.30am 1st on the ramp by 9.10am it was replaced under warranty - just enough time for a coffee and a look around some nice shiny new AlfasExellent service from Research Garage Nuneaton."
Deman77,First Stelvio road trip coming up next week. Boot is pocket sized so I kept my xc90 roof box.Tried it on today. She pulls it off quite well even with overhang.Luckily the windscreen comms area is so big in Stelvio it blocks out the overhang so nothing reducing the vision. I was really not looking forward to that.Managed to fit kids bikes 24in and 12in with only front wheels and pedals off and still half the box free for other bulky but lightweight rubbish.No extra wind noise - tried to 60 on local roads with decent crosswinds. Think Stelvio is a bit wider and lower than Volvo so it’s even less affected.if anyone is not content with OEM bars I recommend Yakima whispbars. They have lower posts and are a wider bar so look better (less bad rather) to my eye. They are better ergonomics than Thule wing bar which is what I had before as their rubber T bolt channel does not need to be cut for your equipment - just pushes in and closes when you take it off.
,
Deman77,Had the first proper journey with the box on. I was very apprehensive as the car is quite twitchy in the back on high rate springs and rear passengers tend to complain on all but the best surfaces.I have to say weighed down with a full roof box and a full boot on tyres at just below max pressure it rode much better than empty. I couldn’t really detect the unsettled bit on any surface. I had a mix of motorway and country lanes and it did fine on both. This is a huge relief.To correct my earlier wind noise comments. I only tested on B roads to 60 before. On motorways nothing till about 65 but at close to 70 get noticeable wind noise - similar sort of levels as what is coming from B pillar - does not seem to increase past that but I didn’t go much past 70.Noticeable is not terrible. Didn’t really interfere with conversation.Dropped the box on the other end so have uncompromised car on holiday.Here is a better picture that shows box size relative to the car.here it is with just roof bars. These don’t make noise at 70 so can be kept on but not the best look for Stelvio IMO.
pocholin,"I like the look with the cross bars, they all match in black, nice! BTW, Misano blue would've been my color of choice if there would've been availability of it in the used market near me, beautiful color!I recently bought these for my QV and a Yakima box, as well as three roof bike carriers (used in the Spring and Summer). I purposely decided on the cross bars with overhang because sometimes I do the combination of the box and two bikes which would not have fitted in the narrower systems like yours."
berndogg66,"This is just a general gripe about bad, really apathetic customer service from Alfa/Fiat of Kirkland Washington.I have had nothing but fantastic luck with my car. I love it. Took a long time and a lot of sacrifice to finally get one. No problems or issues per say, but are now experiencing battery issues which can affect all the computers/relays/sensors causing error codes to be appear and the vehicle to run erratic.....and so I called the dealership, and this is where the problems started.First call - disconnected. Second call - transferred to sales instead of service department. Third call - finally the right department but some one that took a very long time to get me an unsatisfactory answer. Yes I'm covered but can't get me in until AFTER Thanksgiving, cannot replace the battery until they run a 4-5 hour ""diagnostic test"" on it to see if it will replaced and all this may or may not cost me (Still under warranty).I am leaving for Whidbey Island Wednesday with an ""iffy"" battery. If the battery drops below a certain charge or goes dead, I cannot enter the vehicle, if I manage to that I cannot take it out of ""park"" without sufficient charge, and, did I mention, I will be on an island.For a premium brand, in an upscale dealership that prides itself on ""customer satisfaction"" this is unacceptable. Take my car in, NOW, give me a bloody loaner, and run your ""diagnostics"" !!!!"
,
lizard,I would recommend you buy an AGM 95Ah battery. It seems to fix battery related issues.
wictod,Yeah it's a pain... depending on how bad the battery is in your example (mine was stop / start wouldn't work and heated rear window) it should last until you can it in the dealer. My battery was put under some test as well but they had absolutely no problem in changing it for another once they diagnosed it was faulty (original Varta). Mine was replaced with another Varta non AGM variant but from what I've read it appears the US dealers can replace with AGM type versions as lizard has mentioned. hope it goes well..
pocholin,Does installing a new battery require letting the computer know it has a new one like BMWs?
wictod,"Hi All,After some options... I need to put fibre glass fold up step ladders on top of the Stelvio, the yellow and blue Werner type. I've already got the silver rails that run down both sides of the roof.. What kit do I need to add to those silver bars to properly secure the ladders?Cheers in advance.."

Top Down,Posh transport for a window cleaner?
wictod,Thanks for the replies.. window cleanermade me laugh.. I done that about 40 years ago... Normally they'll go in a van but can't be sure the guy who has all the heavy tools and the van can make all this type of work we're getting.. boot will be loaded with tools in hard box. Will be driving a fair way with them... not local jobs. Maybe I should buy a van
Deman77,"If you can make it work why not mix pleasure with business. Driving all those miles in the van thinking it could have been the Alfa I’d be gutted - but then I’ve never driven a van. Putting things on the roof will defeat the purpose though.I cannot imagine you will be packed so much you can’t find room for a ladder in the cab. Unless there are three passengers with you you should be able to fit it. Btw try to make use of footwells for heaviest stuff for better centre of gravity rather than just chucking them in the boot and weight will be closer to the centre of rotation too. I think a nicely padded case for the ladder should do it - may be smth like a padded golf bag travel case or the surfboard travel case. You can move the passenger seat all the way forward, and lean it forward to max out the space for the ladder. Just put in such a way that it leans against the headrest and may be secure it so would not take out your windscreen in an accident."
pocholin,I wonder if you can re-purpose/retrofit a kayak carrier as a ladder carrier. I'd be wanting to drive my Stelvio to work too...who knows it might generate some buzz and get you more work.
wictod,The Yellow / blue fibre ladders (1.8m closed) I bought fitted easily inside the Stelvio with passenger rear seats folded down and I took the passenger side headrest off as well. I could of probably got the longer ones inside.. quite deceptive until you actually pop them inside. Wrapped the front of the ladders that were inside the cabin with a towel but no problems really.. Won't need to think about sticking them on the roof either.. Thanks for all suggestions..
Zyp,Is this an easy DIY fit on a Stelvio Q?Anyone have the instructions to hand so I could see if I deem myself capable or not….Really trying to avoid a 6+hr round trip.cheers

Deman77,Better off reaching out on giulia forum. Not much of an upgrade crowd here. Fair few people had it done there.
katieakita,"Any advice or tips greatly appreciated, thanks in advance. Not mechanically minded and had hoped for a Tonale but they seem a bit away still. The wife and i eligible for the FCA affinity scheme. Looking at the dimensions the Stelvio though higher is not the bus the wife thought it was and looking at pictures does not appear much bigger than theTonale.Goodfortune has put us in the position that we can afford a Stelvio and was looking at a Diesel due to running costs. There seems to have been a few changes since launch which i believe is more about the cabin so any heads up about trim levels, the add on packs, the 190 or 210 engine would be most helpful, many thanks"
,
ban1111,roadtax... we bought a 3 year old low mileage stelvio and the roadtax for the next few years will be £490 a year.. we came from a giulia which was £150 a year and our last few cars including a giuletta cost us no more than 30 notes a year so the road tax for the stelvio is for me a real pain.. i also thought that in the uk the option was 210 bhp and not the 190bhp? so id stick with the 210bhp
alfaitalia,That will be the same for any car costing over £40k new and first registered after April 2017. Luxury car tax adds £335 on top of the road tax until it's six years old....then it will drop back to the £155 or whatever it is now.
Deman77,"What are you after in your car? Stelvio is an unusual one as it is driving focused which is not a forte of SUVs. It will still not be the Giulia but if you need the extra space, the height, the awd, the tow, the boot and the roof rails it is a good driver focused compromise.But then going with diesel you take some of that away. When you say running costs, what is your maths? The largest cost is depreciation.is it only Toenail and Stelvio or do you have other cars on your shortlist? By the time you take delivery Tonale should be available so you might want to wait a bit so you do not regret buying Stelvio."

Have little vices but the boss does love the Alfas we have had so only really a choice of the Guilia or Stelvio. The wife when we met had a big old Mazda that had been dumped on her that she hated and back in the day having tested a 159 and not liking it is a bit loathe to having a saloon but chatting tonight have convinced her to look also at the Guilia, the car would do around 15k a year and never really compared the running costs between the Petrol/Diesel engine. For us the depreciation is not the end of the world and we accept it. Think i will try and get the boss behind the wheel of both and see what she thinks"
cue2,The 210 is reserved for the Veloce whereas it was available in the Speciale spec previously.
Deman77,"Seeing as you didn’t do the maths and clearly are not that fussed, 15k would be on the fence for fuel costs so you may as well go with petrol - it’s more fun. You should definitely try giulia. it’s better ride, lighter car, cheaper. Same engine gets you a bit more performance.If you must have higher riding position Stelvio is hard to beat for driver appeal."
katieakita,"Thanks all for the responses and ideas, went to have a look yesterday at a nearby Alfa dealer and had talked the boss into test driving both. Had a sit in both and did a test drive in a Stelvio (lots of buttons and gadgets) then went to sit in a Guilia but the boss had loved the seats in the Stelvio and found it really comfortable having slipped a disc last year and struggled since now and again so just sat in the Guilia and didn't fancy the driving position so an SUV it is. She fell in love with the colour Misano blue and that was that Stelvio incoming. Result for me as the deal is she drives the better car and i take on the older one. Last time it was a Giulietta 1.6 Jtdm lower spec or a 2.0 Jtdm business edition with Sat nav etc and more extras for around the same price in dark grey but wanted the blue 1.6 hmm! has took around 3 years for here finally to admit she made the wrong choice. Only downside for me is having to say goodbye to my old faithful Giulietta having took me up and down the motorway for 163K miles but starting to use a bit of oil now so the boss has put her foot down. Old faithful even passed the Mot Friday and a bit loathed to take the derisory P/ex offer. Again to all who have responded and those who post on the Forum thank you"
cue2,Advertise the Giulietta on here and get a quote from WeBuyAnyCar. The dealers probably want one but with half that mileage and it could make getting a price from them easier.
Isotope,"@katieakitaI had a 2.0jtdm2 Giulietta, then could afford a 2.2 Giulia it was a nice car, but as we like you have got a bit older the higher seats of an SUV are very easy to transfer into from a standing position so we have a Stelvio but am eagerly awaiting the PHEV Tonale. My father bought a new car about 10 years ago and pulled his back getting into it on the day he picked it up! Two years off work and fused vertebrates later he was back in the game."
Mathew Rudd,So I took delivery of my factory order stelvio quad a week ago now.i decided to have a look on YouTube on stelvios because I'm in love with the car and then I come across my actual car being reved to the redline by some c**t having no respect that its brand new and posting it and the registration on theInternet.imso angry .I have emailed beechdale for them to change who they use to wash their cars and to ask them to take down thevideo.itseems someone else's montreal green gulia has been treated the same if you look at his othervideos.whatwould you do in my situation?

lussoman,"And a brand new engine that presumably wasn't even warmed-up.You have all the evidence you'll ever need. At the very least I'd want some sort of compensation.Presumably the dealer employed this idiot so it's the dealer's responsibility to resolve it.If you're not happy with any solution they come up with, then you can post that evidence at any given opportunity wherever you see fit."
mikesalfa,"To be fair I don't think it's uncommon for new cars to be thrashed prior to delivery to the dealer. Or when people take it for test drives.Although doing this, recording it and putting it on the internet is not the best idea.

It's not a stone cold engine, but it is unlikely to be at peak operating temperature.Once I was given the opportunity to test drive a Porsche Boxster. It was automatic, and the pedals were very close. I had my foot hard on what I thought was the brake when I started the car. However it was the accelerator. I'll never forget... Car ran good though.What would I do if this was my car... Be annoyed obviously, but what can one do. Maybe press for a free service first time round? Realistically I know I would not drive a car like this sedately. It would be a matter of when, not 'if' for the car to go to the red line. The red line, of course if perfectly natural and ok for an engine to do (just not when cold).Is it worse to know something, or just to have never known it in the first place?"
Leo_NL,"I would return it and insist for a new one. If necessary find a way through the factory.The overrevving has been logged probably by the engine ECU but doesn’t say when. Yet, the videoclip says all. Revving an engine without load never is smart to do, something I always try to avoid when working on them."
Navlet,"What a bell end, at least he has provided you with all the evidence. He has also put your car and reg on the internet and sprayed water all over the engine bay, I would want a free service or some form of gesture.Probably will be OK, when the Giulia QV was launched back end of 2016 I was invited to a dealer to see one of the first ones in the UK, needless to say it was revved hard for the attendees expecting a show, I remember thinking at the time it was a bit harsh.Who knows what happens to our pride and joys when they are with dealers."
Muz,"What a manky car wash facility!Like the OP I would be seriously pissed off the find a video like that of my brand new pride and joy. No need to slam the bonnet down like that either, and what’s he doing leaving the bonnet on the catch whilst washing it?I will be interested to hear how Beechdale respond to your very justified complaint."
lussoman,Isn't it. Looks like the sort of place you'd take a cheap run around to for a 5 minute bucket and sponge job.It seems Beechdale have little respect for their customers.
GVblue,"If we knew half of what happened to our loved ones from the minute they rolled off the production line into the hands of the delivery company, we would have nightmares.Not to mention what happens when they go in for a service, so much so, dash cam disconnection is the first action that is carried out.Just comfort yourself with the belief that mechanical tolerances are so precise now that no harm will have been done.I would think that the poor sods working in that depressing environment will get up to all sorts of things to brighten up their days."

Navlet,I wouldnt want to be Beechdale sales director right now.
alfaitalia,"One of my fitters ""forgot"" to put the oil back in a 400 mile (yes just four hundred miles) old Golf.....he then road tested it and it threw a rod.....that took some explaining to the owner and quite a lot of diplomacy to put right and avoid the bad publicity!!!! Only time I remember anything like that in about 15 years working there. But I would say that generally the guys were car enthusiasts and treated the cars as they would want theirs treated.....and they knew they would catch it from me if they didn't. To be honest car owners trying to blame us for every slightest mark or dink on the car was a bigger issue. In the end we did a look round with the customer before they left to stop them trying it on! Customers with unrealistically high expectations of the build quality of new cars was the other issue.....they are mass produced objects....they will NEVER be 100% perfect......even good ones like I sold!! Luckily most punters were not like that!Im not in anyway defending that cleaner.....but with modern engines having good tolerances and running in almost being a thing of the past it wont have done any harm.....but yes I would be cross if it was my car too!"
lussoman,"When you say ''one of my fitters'', are you referring to 'mechanics', and in a business you owned? I'd have thought a competent mechanic was head and shoulders above any car 'salesman'..."

I did not own the business....I was sales manager...then acting General manager. I'll ignore that last comment!.....and I was a paid car mechanic once for an indy in Horndean near Portsmouth before I went into sales.....for purely financial reasons!!."
lussoman,"Ah, fair enough alfaitalia, I understand now. I don't use main dealers as a rule. When I've been forced to go there (car under warranty) I've wondered what goes on in the back where the customer isn't allowed to venture.For about twenty years now I've used the same one-man band mechanic who runs his own little business. Someone I trust and have full respect for.I get that sales people are necessary to hammer out deals, sort finance etc and get vehicles out of the showrooms."
armoore,"A friend of mine picked up a colleague who had just dropped off his car at a dealers for servicing. Driving along they were overtaken by the car being driven rather too ‘enthusiastically’. Further down the road the traffic came to a full stop and the car could be seen in the queue further along so the owner jumped out, ran to his car, hauled the ‘mechanic’ out and gave him a thumping. Not that I condone the action but understandable."

alfaitalia,Video taken down as well......
Deman77,"missed out on the video, but I figure what’s there from description. It is totally unacceptable to do things like that by people who are trusted and have no clear need to red line the car and especially in abusive manner (no warm up or idle revving). I’d be gutted. I would insist on their workshop reaching out to the factory techs as they do when they don’t know how to fix smth to advise what should be done in this instance. They should assume it was cold red lined at idle and potentially a few times to get the video right. At the very least oil should be changed if the car was cold revved and not run in yet as oil may now be contaminated. No point asking for freebees - if they want to give smth to create good will - fine, but the important thing is that they support you to do what is necessary.Having said that I do think a mechanic definitely has a need to give these types of cars full beans and drive them how I would. Is it a perk? Yes. But does it also benefit me as a customer? Yes. If they do so regularly, they have a better chance of spotting something odd with one. Now I do expect the car to be warmed up prior to this and it only takes about 5min driving it at 2.5k.When alfaworkshop was doing my run in oil change I checked with them the car would be insured for a test drive by the mechanic and asked him to take it round the block in race mode to see he was happy with everything. He obliged and came back grinning ear to ear - said he encountered a willing f type R and dropped it out of a roundabout on a dual carriageway. He then checked for leaks before sending me on my way. That is completely different from a sales rep, designated driver or a washing contractor doing that as they have zero need that benefits the customer."

But why I should assume others are any better, I don't know."
Olloyd1,"Good afternoon,Beechdale are aware of the videos circulating YouTube at this time.Like most dealers we are forced to sublet valet work and discussions have been held with the owner of this company who has already dealt with this is the most serious and severe way.There is no excuse for this idiotic behaviour, we thoroughly condemn it and will review this business partnership going forward.From investigation it seems limited to a small volume of vehicles over last few weeks with one being owned by the dealership. The GM is in contact with the owner of the other vehicle to resolve this immediately.Regards,Oliver"
duemila,"Review the partnership, the partnership should be over"
Isotope,Really worried to see this post and haven't seen the video. I bought my Stelvio Veloce from Beechdale in July and I had a fantastic experience from the dealership. The car was in stock and made available about a week after I'd seen it. Having not seen the video you refer to was it just a joyride or a proper PDI run?
GVblue,"The car was stationary and being valeted in what looked like a derelict second world war underground bunker. The idiot valeting it filmed himself revving the engine to the redline.Can't imagine they would be revving the nuts off an ordinary 280 bhp car, as even in the cavernous cellar they seemed to be working in. the aural delights just wouldn't be present.I'm guessing it's just a Quad thing.Unless it was just some muppet who doesn't like people having nice cars and was carrying out a mechanical version of 'keying'."
Navlet,"We will never know what happens to our cars when with a dealer or garage, especially if they sub contract work out which is not unusual. In this instance it was recorded by the muppet himself.Hopefully Beechdale use someone else now for washing their cars, that place looked awful."
sizewell,"One used to get a ""Valet key"" with some cars. It would take very little effort for Alfa to enable the engine to be ""Locked into Valet Mode"", by software. The same could be done for all exotica! This kind of thing could then be prevented. It would also make the car more secure when parked up for the night!"
Deman77,"I think that usually just limits the speed and not the revs. Leaves plenty of room to abuse or even to wipe it out off a roundabout.It positive that they get “a pro” and not just paying minimum wage someone to scrape grit with a bucket of dirty water. Though that might still happen for post service wash.But I would just contract a mobile valet guy. Just think of all the petrol moving the cars to the site and back and the drivers and their cars. Seems awfully inefficient.They mobile valet guys carry enough ionised water to properly pressure wash a dozen cars. You get to see what they are doing. Just erect a permanent gazebo for them in your parking lot and sort out a call out system. It will work out cheaper, the quality will be better and they would bite your hand off for that kind of volume business."

Isotope,I'm just 4 months in to a new Stelvio Veloce and love it. The normal fuel consumption does seem a bit low but its a really nice place to be in 2021 trim!
Muz,"Had my 18000 mile service at 11500 miles and just under 2 years last weekAll good except having had max on the oil level monitor since I got the car, it’s now 9/10ths. Oh for a dipstick.All a bit anal I know but it annoys me and I won’t be going back to the dealer as it’s not really a big dealThe car clearly has enough oil but now I won’t be certain if the oil level changes over the next few months unless it’s dramatic, I could top up but if I put in too much that is going to be worse.Any of you had similar after a service?"
,
RJS463,I don’t see the issue. 90% is fine. Why would you want it on max? Having too much is as bad as having too little oil.
SmOgER,9/10 is way better than 10/10 and not knowing if it was overfilled (as it's actually the case quite often).
Muz,"Thanks for the responses, good points made, I was overthinking this I think"
Pud237,"For what it's worth, I try to fill oil levels to somewhere around 2/3rds or 3/4 between min & max, where there's a dipstick. I was always taught never to fill up to max."

Deman77,Cheap Bluetooth battery monitor takes 15min to fit and connect to your iPhone - one of the best upgrades.

Deman77,"That looks like mine. Mine exact one was removed from Amazon but probably replaced with one exactly like it. It is generic and gets sold under different names. Just need to connect to battery monitor app. The app does all that needs doing - displays history, polls the unit for latest reading when in range, sends daily notifications with state of charge or emergency ones when soc is critical. Just need a couple of nuts and add them to existing terminal posts so as not to unscrew anything that’s there."
Isotope,I noticed some guys taking an interest in my car and then they moved away when the car unlocked only to get into another Stelvio? If it's anyone on here I'm happy to share the MY21 car features. I think you were looking for the keyless entry?
,
cue2,Or just looking for spares!
Isotope,"Hope not, their car looked about 2 years older than mine? Once they realised I saw their Stelvio it became a bit more normal. These cars are so rare I can understand people comparing them when they see one."

Pandra,"Rear wiper is available without the arm. It's a standard clip out blade.Just put a Bosch replacement on mine for £9. Code: A310H.The originals seem to be very tight which just lends to the theory that you need to change the whole arm. It's not the case, but it does feel like you're going to break it at first. Just strap on your big boy pants and unclip it. The replacements go on easier (perfectly secure) and the problem goes away.For reference, I got a full set of Bosch Aeroblades from WindscreenWipersDirect. Three pieces for £32.60."
Pandra,"I am selling my unused space saver, along with all of the paraphernalia that is needed to install it in the Stelvio boot.You get the wheel and clamp, the steel bridge that spans the battery and the polystyrene boot insert. I don't know what the standard car comes with tool wise, so if you need the jack too, then that's fine. If they all came with a jack then obviously we won't exchange jacks.In return, I will require £200 and your polystyrene boot insert so that my boot floor doesn't collapse. Due to it's size, this means that we will have to meet up somewhere to exchange items, so I'm sorry if that will exclude some folks who may be a long way off. Of course it's up to you how far you are prepared to travel. Fortunately I'm fairly central in north Oxfordshire, so hopefully that won't be too much of an issue for a lot of people.The wheel is as new, unused, as is the jack (if required), and the polystyrene in perfect order. Pictures attached.First response to this thread has dibs so that everyone can see that it is fair. Then contact can be through PM's etc.I'm listing it here as it's Stelvio specific and it might get lost in the general sales forum. The wheel will no doubt fit a Giulia but I need the boot former which is unlikely to match, so for now it's Stelvio first.I assume most people on here will be fine with it, but if you are not sure how to go about removing the bits, don't worry, I can do it for you, takes five minutes."

Muz,I’d be very interested if you don’t get other takers and are down south in the next month or two. Being on the South Coast between Worthing and Littlehampton makes it just that bit too far for me though.I would be willing to travel but not that far North
Pandra,"No problem Muz, Wait and see I suppose"
RJS463,How quickly do you need to do this? I'm on holiday until Friday so could meet over next weekend 30/31st? I can meet you in Buckingham Area as it's about an hour from me (live in Arlesey Beds). Could you bring a socket for the clamp bolts?
Pandra,"I’m in no rush, but typically can’t do next weekend. I’m sure we can sort something out, and tools etc are no problem.If you want to go ahead just reply here so that everyone else can see that it’s claimed, otherwise someone else might swoop in and take it and it starts to get ugly. I’ll then pm you to make arrangements."
RJS463,"Yes, I want it please. I’m coming back off holiday early so may be able to do this between Tue and Fri this week if that works. PM please with a suitable day this week or a future weekend you can do it."

lussoman,Jaguar F-Pace SVR vs. Alfa Stelvio QuadrifoglioThe best cars Alfa and Jaguar make might be SUVs - but which is better?www.pistonheads.com
,
Deman77,I think they got the gist of it perfectly. Captured what Stelvio qv is about. She really does make you want to drive like a hot hatch any chance you get.I find mine more comfortable and less noisy on motorway and in town than my previous xc90 barge. More controlled body movement. The fidget in the rear settles down after about 2k as suspension loosened up.They overstate quite a bit the importance for a special driver’s cars of a big touch screen or the softness of vynil.They also briefly mention but don’t emphasise enough the advantage of being able to use these cars at 8/10 all year round. Just about any rwd sports car or saloon that out-enjoys Stelvio qv in the dry on perfectly surfaced public roads at legal speeds will be driving 6/10 at most for 6 months of the year or on tricky roads. The AWD super estate and suv crowd will struggle to match for fun as they are all heavier and none have the cleverness of the Q4 set up which is RWD by default rather than by exception like others. And most have much harsher ride.
jerehada,"Agree a quad at low speeds is a very quiet and smooth engine and fine at motorway speeds. I've liked driving long journeys in it and never felt tired even compared to big lux estates before. It does have a real strong what I call self righting when on badly surfaced uneven roads at low speeds it can jostle you a bit (stiff springs and roll bar combination) apart from that comfort is fine the dampers work beautifully.My plan for interior is to visit an automotive trimmer and leather the door cards, steering column shroud put alcantara on some other surfaces such as the gear lever but car would be out of action for some time and I would miss driving it."
Jonathan Coates,"An interesting conclusion I think. ""I'd get the Jag as it has worse fuel consumption, it's slower, uglier and costs a lot more but I've always wanted a big etch-a-sketch"".Wow."
Deman77,"I think they are similar bracket for cost ie heavily undercutting the larger UHP SUVs the x5m, Cayenne, q8 or Urus for broadly the same straight line performance. The Jag would do a better job than Stelvio at comfort, has bigger boot and the v8 - it can tow too. So it does have its advantages even if it will not beat Stelvio on the n-ring, it still puts a smile on your face.for example,@Multo Benewho hated my21 changes to his giulia qv - not as focused as his earlier one - sold it and went looking far and wide. Both Stelvio and Ftype featured as well as m5, c63 and he went for the Jag. It depends what you need it to do for you. He has things that will do a better job than either for B road thrills so other aspects may become more important.I think f type is a very legitimate competitor and can definitely be a better car for many.There is no way it is as nice to wash - that has to be a category for people who find car washing therapeutic."
alfaitalia,"It does not really say that though does it....what it does say about the Jag is its drives close to as well as the ALFA and ""Add into that its extra space, vastly superior driving environment and plush motorway manners and the case it presents really is undeniably strong."" I don't see the Jag as worse looking either....not much in the looks of any of the current style of ""swollen hatchback"" styled SUVs to my eye. I certainly see a lot more Jags than Stelvios though....which is odd as the only sales figures for 2021 I can find are Europe wide ones and total sales for the F-Pace and Stelvio are only a few hundred apart.....That said I don't like or have a use for an SUV....so I would not buy either of them!"
Deman77,"lol. If you hate dogs why offer an opinion on relative looks of the two especially if you say they are both ugly? No offence meant I just don’t see how this adds value to the discussion.By the way have you seen svr in real life? Or talking f-pace in general. It’s very rare - I’ve only seen one to probably 10 Stelvio QVs in the last year though to be fair Alfa stands out more so easier to spot. I thought it tried too hard to look special and it was not working, though I think intrinsically it is pretty special.to me the fact that Alfa developed their QVs first and the rest was derived from them meant that QVs have most of their extra kit functional so they look natural as designer intended. The performance models of other makes tend to be derived from their standard models so they end up lacking in main designer input and are basically kitted up by special ops divisions to look special. So everything is very colour dependant. Stelvio and Guilia qv look good in any colour - just have to pick the right wheels colour for some."
Multo Bene,"Dare I say it, so far I am very happy with my F Pace SVR.I never thought I’d buy an SUV or a black one at that!The ride and handling is, unsurprisingly, very Jaguar like, a lovely well judged blend of ride quality, handling and steering.It's a bit of a hooligan this car and sounds fantastic, the supercharged V8 has near instant twist that you just don't get with a turbo engine.Inside I have lovely leather sports seats and lots of technology that actually all works well and is very usable.I think the Stelvio was essentially a bit too similar to what I've had before, and this is bigger and more usable yet still full of fun factor.Still feel like a sell out buying an SUV, but when it's this good, frankly who cares!And yes, they are pretty rare, another thing that is nice."
Deman77,The true black SVR would be parked in the disabled space even if all the others are free. You must read the manual.I saw a velar svr parked not across two spaces in my golf club and I had to do a double take to make sure. Totally ruins the image.
Multo Bene,"Yup, the image can be questionable, especially the Range Rover Sport SVR. Amusingly they must sell a lot of SVR badges though, as I keep spotting badges up range rovers"
Deman77,"No, I’m just pulling your leg. It’s the Range Rover SVR. Jag not many would know even if they saw it hence buying it as status symbol does not work. People buy it for what it can do on the road whilst still doing the family stuff. That’s probably why they don’t sell that many.The f-type v8 is more ubiquitous and when I see someone get in I I find an excuse to delay passing it to make sure I can hear it start."
gogsygtv,"Hi All, just put a deposit down on a Stelvio and need a bike carrying solution and as no tow bar or rails fitted on the car I'm buying so I've got the choice of installing either.For those that have done the same which would you recommend in terms of cost and living with? I'm coming from an e-class estate with roof bars for the last 7 years so no worries lifting bikes up top, but quite fancy the convenience of a tow bar mounted carrier. My current thule roof bike carrier is past its best so either way I am starting from scratch.Had a search but all I found were quite specific questions or about the OEM setup. Any thoughts very much appreciated!"

gogsygtv,"Also I know roof bars can be fitted without the rails but I am not a fan, having seen images I'd be concerned about causing marks on the roof where they clamp on."
cue2,"Flush rails installationHello, I've decided to install the ""LONGITUDINAL ROOFBARS"" myself. Is there anyone with experience of this? It seems that I have to remove the inner roof lining. The rails has seals on the sides and around the pin screws. I think the covers could be fastened the same way as the rails since...www.stelvioforum.com7 hrs labour including removal of interior headliner."
W1NST,Have a look at SeaSucker bike racks - a few guys have been using them on the Rolex Forum I am on and have been impressed with them.
gogsygtv,"I really like the idea of those, never seen them before. Ideally though I’d be after a 3 bike carrier so it would be the big version which I’d need to put on the roof I expect. I’d be a little nervous of paint damage and having 3 bikes in the wind relying on the suction cups. Having read a little about that I think that would be quite unfounded but i know I would struggle to shake that niggling doubt! Going to give them some consideration though.DIY roof rails seems not a bad shout, any advice where I might be able to get the genuine parts? Feel quite confident dropping the liner and from that forum link looks a breeze to fit.If anyone has had the tow ball retrofitted have you gone to the dealer to fit?"
Deman77,I believe tow bars never get factory fitted. Dealer accessory normally after car arrived. If on order sheet you do not get charged for labour. I could be wrong.
gogsygtv,"Thank you, all options seem to be coming together similar cost wise. I've found genuine rails around £350, assuming fitting will double that price at least or its a afternoon of my time. Tow bar roughly the same.Having looked more and more into the seasucker bomber 3 bike rack it looks like it will hang off the back and while its £450 or so, it would be the cheapest option overall. Maybe I can live with it after all!"
MultiDoc,My Stelvio came with the factory roof rails and I just received the Alfa Romeo bars. I’ll be installing them this weekend probably and will transfer the Thule bike racks (3 in total) that I had been using on my 159 previously.Unfortunately for some weird reason the QV does not have any towing allowance otherwise I would have gone for a towbar solution instead.
cue2,The crossbars are at least correct length rather than hanging out at the ends!
