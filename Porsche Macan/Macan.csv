AndyC160,"The search for a replacement to my current Macan 2.0 hots up....This GTS has been on my radar for a while:https://finder.porsche.com/gb/en-GB/det ... =price_ascNot a massive spec but I like the idea of keeping it simple on a GTS and it visually stays true to the GTS with the spyder alloys, GTS interior, although I really want it with extended leather.And I know the spare and 75 litre tank wasn't ticked when new, but....Does anyone know the car or owned it previously who could give me a bit of history and whether it's worth the long drive up to see it?Also, how are Perth to deal with?Reg is NA70YFN","July 06, 2023"

wab172uk,Looks very dull. Dull Grey with Black wheels.Much nicer examples out there. Personal opinion of course.,"July 07, 2023"
Col Lamb,Personally I would avoid any Macan with only 8 way seats which this one has.,"July 07, 2023"
SAC1,The 8-way GTS are fantastic. So comfortable and the right amount of body grip for the GTS' cornering forces without the seat bolsters being too high. The Race Tex centres are cooler than leather in summer and warm in winter.,"July 07, 2023"
AndyC160,"Yes, I have 14 way comforts with memory in my current one. Maybe use the memory a couple of times a year which is handy...after it's been in for a service etc. Would I really miss all the adjustability? Is it such a compromise?I also have the 75 litre tank and reversing camera. I would like the bigger tank again for when we go up to Scotland and other long trips. Reversing camera...not a massive deal breaker especially with the issues of leaks that people have had on Gen 2 & 3.","July 07, 2023"

wab172uk,"Got invited by Porsche centre Teesside to test drive the Taycan, and enjoy an afternoon tea at a very nice hotel.I've been sceptical of EV's from the start, so was expecting to hate the drive. But thought it'd be interesting to have a go and keep an open mind. The Taycan itself looks pretty good. Certainly one of the best looking EV's on sale today.I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Not what I was expecting. The ride quality was excellent, but being a Porsche I did expect that. The silence and lack of engine noise did feel strange, and have to say, without the radio on, you do hear a lot of tire noise and wind noise. Having the radio on, which most of us will have on most of the time, then it was less noticeable.  Sport plus mode brought some noise which improved things, but still no substitute for a proper engine noiseThe bits I didn't like, was the controls. The lower centre screen was ok. Yes everything is just a screen with haptic buttons, but worked pretty well. The sat-nav screen wasn't as easy to use as in the Macan. But the thing I hated the most was the controls for the lights being haptic buttons on the screen behind the steering wheel. I just don't see the point. Hard to press when the car moving around on the road, so eyes are taken away rather the reaching down for a toggle switch. I guess most people will just leave in auto-mode.The thing I was most impressed by was the acceleration. Any small gaps in traffic, and you're never out of revs, off boost, or waiting for the gearbox to downshift. It made overtaking a split second decision, and thus making progress really easy. I did notice that I was always on the brakes. When cars in front lift off, there is obviously no engine braking, so you're constantly on the brakes when you wouldn't normally be. I expect disc and pad wear to be far greater on EV's compared to ICE cars.The range. On collection it was stating 228 miles, and I was assumed it was fully charged. So I'm assuming the demo cars get driven pretty hard, as I was expecting to see better range than that. Considering my Macan shows up with around 390 miles of range on it's 75l fuel tank. Though TBH, it's not been driven that hard yet.So my conclusion? I was very impressed, and have more respect for EV's than I did before. While it was undoubtedly quick due to the instant power on tap, it did feel just a bit remote compared to an ICE car. Could I live with one? For most of my journeys, yes, it would suit our needs. But for longer trips to Scotland and wales, then maybe not. Not unless you plan trips and hope the charging stations are working that day, and no queue's waiting for them. I still think the infrastructure needs to be rapidly improved. There is one charge port in a car park in Grassmere, and every time I've been there the same car is plugged into the charge port several hours later. So selfish drivers, plugging in, and go off for a days walking, leaving anyone else needing it, stranded.If manufacturers can make EV feel more ICE like, then maybe the future of EV's might not be that bad, infrastructure allowing. But for now, I'll stick to Petrol, and all the benefits, it brings over EV's. But maybe Hydrogen is the answer to get the benefits of both? No charging, and fill up in minutes. Or synthetic fuels. No charging, fill up in minutes, use the millions of existing cars already on our roads, so no scrapping of perfectly good cars. Unfortunately most investment money is being spent on EV's. More need spending on the alternatives. Then we could have several types of cars on our roads benefiting what type of car suits each individual, rather than legislative for EV which a for a lot of people just won't be a viable option.","July 01, 2023"
andreas,"Interesting comments, and somewhat similar to the conclusion JayEmm came to in the YouTube video he put online today...","July 01, 2023"
BZR81,I presume this was yesterday? I was parked next to your Macan at Teesside in the afternoon I think. I should have taken a photo!The Porsche pro mentioned another Macan customer has a problem with their centre console - that’s not you is it?,"July 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"Yeah, it was yesterday. No problem with my console though. Mine was the Blue one","July 01, 2023"
BZR81,"Yeah I noticed your plate when I pulled in and recognised the username!Ah ok I was booked in for a masterclass/extended handover and the the guy asked if I was the one having problems with the console, which I’m not, so I did wonder if it was yours. Seeing our cars along side each other shows how much customisation is available, as they were quite contrasting in appearance, yet essentially the same car.","July 01, 2023"
2japs,"Thanks for the review, not for me, like the look of the rear but not the front! I’m sticking with what I’ve got for the foreseeable. I’m more interested in what you had for afternoon tea, normally fare or a bit special?","July 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"How did the second handover go? I got offered it, but didn’t think I’d learn much else than what I already knew.","July 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"Normal fare TBH. Cakes, sandwiches, and scones. Got a glass of champagne at the start, but took my time with that given I was driving. It’s a nice place, and I think we might go back for an evening meal. Menu looked nice. The Pheasant inn at Harmone. Just outside of Helmsley.To be honest, I was expecting to hate the Taycan, as I’ve been anti EV. But it was annoyingly good. Would I go out and swap my Macan for an EV? No. Would I get a new Macan EV in a few years? No. Not while there are ICE alternatives. Impressed, but not converted !","July 01, 2023"

bennachie,"You must know someone.  Lots of visits to and purchase from OPC Teesside since they opened.........................Nothing, NadaTyneside MUCH more accommodating - I may have to return north of the tunnel.............. or try t'Leeds","July 01, 2023"
BZR81,"Yeah pretty much that. It was just really an extended version of the initial handover. I’m only 30 mins from Teesside so it filled an hour on a Friday afternoon. He said when I booked it to do a little list of any queries I had. He put my car inside, not the handover bay, but another one round on the side that faces the main road. Anyway he just went through all the buttons switches compartments etc right round the car but the only real query I had was to do with the PCM not logging my Porsche ID in all the time. He fiddled about with it for a bit and we established that it seemed like the pcm and CarPlay were fighting over the connection. Didn’t really get it resolved but I don’t think it’s a major thing.","July 01, 2023"
MCDK,Picked up my Taycan GTS 2 weeks ago. Great to be back in a Porsche and it’s a truly unbelievable car. S o fast and composed.,"July 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"I had to wait 2 months after my car arrived at the dealership, due to the amp problem. So it might have been a day out for the inconvenience?","July 02, 2023"
Ian.g,"Interesting to read... I moved from a Macan to a Taycan 18 months ago and am a convert! The driving dynamics are just so much better than a petrol car, there is no getting away from that. Most charging is at home. I have used very little public charging. Never visit a petrol station, which can only be good. And recent fall in electricity rates with overnight charging costs about 3p/mile or a bit less when charging at home.Obviously they aren't for everyone - I fully accept that. If you drive 200+ miles on a regular basis with no charging at the other end before you come back (or even 120 miles then back the same day) then stick to ICE - definitely. But if you don't often drive that sort of distance, the improved driving dynamics make for a much better experience every time you go out.  And as MCDK says above, they are so fast. A Macan seems slow and unresponsive by comparison (sorry, but this is the case - I had a GTS loaner for a day and even that seemed pedestrian).It looks like you had the rear wheel drive version... is that correct? It probably seemed quick compared to your Macan, but is the slowest Taycan. However it probably seems fast because of the instant torque available.Interesting development recently about eco fuels and the EU pushing back the deadline for no new ICE. We will see what happens! Enjoy your Macan... And MCDK and I will enjoy our Taycans!","July 02, 2023"
Nuclear Nick,"Has it been reliable Ian? Did it fall foul of the heater failure issue that affected many cars?I really liked the one I tried, so much so that I got very close to placing an order, but SWMBO was against it mainly due to us already having the 911 and our dire experience of public charging knocked it on the head.","July 03, 2023"
Jon A,"Was inspired to look at Taycans on the website yesterday as I think they are really nice cars. My word, the depreciation appears eye watering - £120k cars with a £40k drop at a year old, and that’s at Porsche!!Not quite sure if this means they are bargains, over priced in the first place or just best avoided altogether…","July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,"Yeah, it was the RWD version. So what, 326bhp? Felt very nippy for 326bhp especially as the car is probably over 2 Tonnes. It felt faster at slower speeds, and you could feel it wasn't as punchy at higher speeds. Did a few launches, and wasn't that impressed, as expected it to be faster. But I wasn't aware at the time what version I had.I expect a GTS, Turbo, & Turbo S to be in a completely different league.One thing we did notice however, which I should have told the dealer about, was at one stage all the screens went blank. Only lasted a couple minutes, and it must have re-booted. Luckily the speedo screen stayed on, but everything else went blank.","July 03, 2023"
MCDK,Not sure about a 40k drop on a year old Taycan. Would need to see which model but maybe a very heavily optioned up 4S which is never a good plan no matter which model of car.My GTS ST was £121k and the Porsche value after 3 years is £70k so at worst that’s £50k in 3 years and we all know Porsche finance will be playing it safe.,"July 03, 2023"
Jon A,GTS might fair a little better but just put a two month old cross T 4s into finance calculator and that’s saying  £56k final option payment in 36 months. Car is £105k but was £121k new in April…Most others follow similar pattern particularly sports tourismo’s which seem even worse!Probably just a symptom of used EV market falling quite steeply at the moment. It does make a nearly new Taycan look like good value tbh (as long as used EV  prices don’t continue to crash),"July 03, 2023"
Paul1970,Suspect  the low GFVs are a result of a) fast movement in battery tech which may make a 200 or 300 mile range untouchable in a few years  b) the limited number of people who will be in the market for a £60k 3 year old electric car and c) the fact that these cars will never have the classic status that say a 911 has. I can’t ever see there being a market for a 20 year old Taycan.Overall anyone who buys an electric car outright is either rich or mad since there is a huge risk around equity. Far better to let the manufacturer take on the depreciation risk whilst tech moves so fast and the 2nd hand demand is unknown.,"July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,"Most EV's especially high ticket items like the Taycan will be company cars. Kept for 1-2-3 years then move onto the next new car. So battery tech will always be there when buying new, and not keeping long term.The second hand market (we are already seeing it) will be flooded with cars no one wants, due to the old battery tech. So what happens then? Cars scrapped? Not very eco-friendly. New batteries installed? Who pays for that?The 2030 (2035 in Europe) ban should be scrapped, and manufactures should have been allowed to develop some EV cars, that would appeal to the company car buyer. The rest of us use ICE cars until either EV's get good range,  infrastructure put in to accommodate all these new EV's, Charging is as quick as filling up with petrol, or better alternatives are developed.It feels like EV technology is still in it's infancy, yet manufacturers are being forced to spew these cars out without any consideration of the consequences.  This is what happens when politicians force through their believes on the people. Never thought out, and implemented poorly.It still feels like we are in the Betamax V VHS era, with the only money being spent is developing the Betamax.","July 03, 2023"
MCDK,"Seems hard to believe but some people actually like the way an EV drives and thus would be happy to buy one at 3 years old. Why wouldn’t they, especially with a manufacturers warranty to cover any issue. Battery warranty is something like 7 or 8 years anyway.","July 03, 2023"
andreas,"Tesla battery warranty guarantees at least 70% capacity after 8 years or 120K miles.  In practice, Model S/X batteries are retaining 90% capacity after 200K miles.","July 03, 2023"
Jon A,"I agree and like very much the way an EV drives. I think there is a difference between a company car and buying privately though.If I buy a three year old EV with 30k miles and then put another 30k on it, it starting to get fairly close to the end of battery warranty period (albeit in this example another 20k miles). The problem is when the batteries do give up the ghost, the car is an instant write off due to cost of replacement. This means second owners are in danger of owning a practically worthless car even with 60k miles on the clock, even though the batteries may last longer than 80k miles - who would pay more than tuppence ha’penny to find out??This is contributing to EV used values among other things - these cars have got to come down in price to be viable on the used market not to mention the depreciation to the new private buyer?","July 03, 2023"
andreas,Tesla batteries have a useful life of 300K to 500K miles.  One factor which extends battery life is avoiding rapid charging.,"July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,"Do you get commission on every EV sold?  Or just trying to impress Greta?Seriously though, all the points raised regarding second hand EV's are entirely relevant. Unfortunately those who are all for EV's can't see or accept any disadvantages or other peoples concern's.There's a few on PH. If you don't embrace Electric cars 100%, then you're the devil himself.","July 03, 2023"
Jon A,"I think those numbers come from a tweet by Elon Musk AndreasHowever, it really doesn’t matter how long they might last, it’s more how long they are warranted for - anything after that is just risk?Either way, it’s certainly a perceived weaknesses, not least by the warranty insurers!I’m certain this will be one of many issues that will be solved in time…","July 03, 2023"
SAC1,"EVs are a bigger insurance risk too. So premiums are much higher than the equivalent ICE vehicle.If it's a company car, then not your personal additional cost. But another factor to bear in mind for private buyers.Yes I know there's no road tax for EVs, but that will change in the future.","July 03, 2023"
andreas,"Yes, I think he claimed those figures.Here's a snippet from an article (link below)...With over a million Tesla vehicles sold, there are several real-life examples of owners racking up huge mileage. Twitter user gem8mingen drives a 2013 Tesla Model S P85 that has reached over one million miles, with the original battery pack replaced at 180,000 miles.Tesloop, a former shuttle service company in California, was one of the first to run a 2016 Model X 90D past 300,000 miles back in 2018. That electric SUV mostly relied on DC fast charging, which can degrade batteries quicker, and yet the company reported just 12.6 percent battery degradation with most of that occurring in the first nine months of service.The Maiden Voyage blog has been sharing one owner's experience with a 2018 Tesla Model 3 Long Range RWD that reached the 200,000 miles mark with 13.7 percent degradation. One MotorTrend reader, Cory, shared with us that his 2018 Model 3 Long Range had crossed the 100,000-mile mark in late June 2022 with around 7 percent capacity loss.https://www.motortrend.com/features/how ... tery-last/","July 03, 2023"
andreas,I wish!,"July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,"Another thing with EV's are there weight. Several multi storey car parks are now refusing entry, as they weren't designed to have every car at over 2 Tonnes. And I doubt anyone will pay to have their multi storey car park strengthened.And there is also the fire risk regarding EV's. I know every EV evangelist refuses to acknowledge EVs catch fire. But they do. Plenty of stories on-line, which amazingly the MSM chose to ignore??  Once this becomes more common, insurance with rise for EV customers. And what happens if an EV catches fire while charging in a multi storey car park? it'll probably burn every car in there to the ground.My house has a car port, which our bedroom is above. There is no way on gods earth I would leave an EV under there charging up. More so through the night while we slept.","July 03, 2023"
Jon A,"Indeed, but as I said, nobody in their right mind is going to shell out big money on a high mileage EV just in case it doesn’t follow the pattern of the 3 cars mentioned particularly unwarranted?Conversely, it might make a 100k mile Tesla a great buy, who knows??","July 03, 2023"
andreas,"Tesla has its own insurance product, currently only available in the US, I think.  As you'd expect, it's very sophisticated, and uses real-time data from the car to determine how ""safe"" the driver is, in order to set the premium.  Better drivers get quoted lower premiums.  Cunning!","July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,"The most pointless way to determine anyones insurance premium. How often do we see drivers driving slowly, but poorly. Almost (and sometimes) leaving a trail of destruction behind them as people crash trying to avoid them. But hey, they stick to 25 in a 30, so clearly safe.","July 03, 2023"
andreas,"From an insurer's perspective, it isn't pointless at all.","July 03, 2023"
MCDK,I think I might actually have heard of ICE cars sometimes going on fire and apparently their engines and gearboxes have even been known to wear out and need replaced at high cost,"July 03, 2023"
wab172uk,True. But they don't burn for days or just catch fire while stood there doing nothing.,"July 04, 2023"

Jon A,The ST’s seem worse affected of all by depreciation. CT’s not much better but buying a new one of these at the moment (privately) is going to cost big time it seems…,"July 04, 2023"
wab172uk,I doubt anyone will be buying these privately. Or at least not many.911's on the other hand ......,"July 04, 2023"
Jon A,Yes you are probably right there. Lovely car but would take a 911 over one of these in a heartbeat,"July 04, 2023"
Wing Commander,"It does seem odd, as I think that the ST is a good looking wagon, and a bit more practical than the saloon.","July 04, 2023"
Ian.g,"So to answer a few questions... So far it has been reliable. I have actually had 2. I started with a 4S and at the time there was a massive chip shortage then the waits went up to >1 year so I put down a deposit on a second one. Couldn't get a 4S in a sensible timescale so ordered a Turbo. My thinking was that there would be little or no depreciation. I was correct - only 5k in 10 months. Now of course is a different story and my current plan is to keep the Turbo for a long time. Bought through a limited company so the depreciation is tax free. Over 5-6 years it will still be a lot of money but more palatable than a short term exchange at the moment.My heater works fine although I accept it could pack up. As per the loaner described, my screens occasionally go blank and re-boot. In the past it has periodically forgotten my radio favourites but that bug seems to have been sorted now. There are a few quirks, but so far nothing has stopped it driving. The 4S did spend some time getting a communication issue sorted out. I think it eventually had an electronic bit unplugged to reset it.Both cars have been fantastic to drive. If you spend some time on the Taycan forum you will see that the RWD is probably software limited and a lot slower than the others. The 4S drops the 0-62 down to 4 seconds (I think RWD is 5.4) and Turbo down to 3.2.Currently the 4S I sold has caught up the depreciation I never had and the difference between my old 4S and the Turbo remains the same as the difference between the new purchase prices (Autotrader figures). I suspect this is because I had to add £15k extras to the 4S but only £5k to the Turbo to get the same spec due to the standard Turbo spec being higher. Also got various extras that I didn't spec on the 4S. Like warp speed accelerationI have to say that the cars are just awesome to drive. They are not going to handle as well as a 911 due to their weight, but the responsiveness is like driving around with the sport response button pressed all of the time. And when you want it to go, it really goes.I do think that the whole electric thing is not quite ready for everyone yet, but since I do relatively few long journeys and have charging at home it is great for my use. The 4 seats are good as I can take people in the car easily. I recently went to Liverpool for a meeting - 3 of us went up and stayed for a few days and 4 came back in the car, no problems. There were strict instructions to limit luggage size though!Now I have moved to a night time EV tariff the charging costs have dropped to ~3p/mile and it is easy to plug in at home. My charger is set to connect overnight and it works well.I have no regrets buying either Taycan. If you think the electric could work for you then there are probably quite a lot of 1-2 year old cars around at a very good price. I doubt you would regret it!","July 04, 2023"
Jon A,"Great write up Ian, very informative and balanced. I have admired Taycans for some time and have driven one and loved it!My circumstances are similar to yours so running costs and ease of use will not be a problem - where we differ is that I would be a private buyer and depreciation will play a part as I doubt it would be particularly long term.My only other concern is that it has a great party trick with its acceleration but lacks a little “soul” or drama at least for me.Having said all that I think they look great and the interior is a fabulous place to be so swings and roundabouts.Still probably best EV around and that’s saying something given how many get launched weekly it would seem","July 04, 2023"
MCDK,"I’m also a private buyer. My decision was based upon wanting another Porsche, needing space for two teenagers and 2 small dogs and wanting a car rather than a SUV. the fact it runs on electric isn’t my reason but having another EV for the last two years I do enjoy the instant power and low running costs. Would love a 911 but it doesn’t suit my current needs.","July 04, 2023"
Ian.g,"Similar to me. The Taycan is more usable than a 911 due to proper rear seats. If I hadn’t liked the Taycan I would have gone with a 911, but it wasn’t quite practical enough for my needs. Although a 911 would be fantastic to own I get more out of the Taycan because I can use it more due to the rear seats - adults just won’t sit in the back of a 911 for anything other than a short journey. It is probably the only car that would tempt me back from an EV though!","July 04, 2023"
AndyC160,One thing that i think is great about the taycan and really stands out for me (and which surprisingly never seems to get mentioned in reviews) is the view out of the windscreen...seeing the front wings curve up and over the wheels is very '60s sportcar-esque.

MCDK,Wonder why your Admiral quote is so high. Is that quote as an extra car to the Macan or as a replacement? If it’s an extra then they maybe aren’t applying any or not enough NCB. I did have an argument with them over that issue as they dropped a NCB I had built up on another car when it came into the multicar policy. Hence why I was happy to get that NCB re established and start the Taycan on its own policy.,"July 06, 2023"

Life is all too short and I buy my cars for the pleasure it gives me, unless you have seriously deep pockets and some contacts not very many cars you can buy where your investment makes money.Having some Scottish blood does help of course, I have the car on a four year PCP contract, but what I noticed and perhaps the finance company never was, I did pay a good deposit for the car, I know what the final payment is, but of course I can hand the car back to them if I want, especially when there is no financial penalty per mile surchage over teh 12K miles I thought I would do, so ""Risk"" sits with the finance company who thinks I might hand a car back with Max 48K miles on it and actually find its nearer 110K miles and when the double check, no surcharge per extra mile!!Personally I dont see why somebody would spend £80K plus on a car for it to sit doing nothing, its a machine and it needs to be used.What I should really do is work out my total amount of 98Ron fuel put in the car, divide that by say 65L fills and I know from my business the flow rate of fuel thru a dispenser into a car and tell the forum, how many minutes in the last year I spent putting petrol in the car. I will then compare that with an average EV and see how long somebody would have spent charging the car to do that mileage?Bet there is a slight diffrence.So the ""Baby"" was one today, and I look forward to its next birthday and will post on here, not sure I will have it as a teenagerThanks again everybody for your comments, I enjoy being on the forum.

Ascotmacan,The battery in my 2 year old Macan does not seem to be holding its charge very well. During driving it is being charged well up to 14.7 volts but when parked at home the voltage drops to less than 12 volts in a few days. I believe Porsche did not use to warranty batteries longer than about 12 months but my warranty documents do not mention any timescales. Any experiences?,"July 02, 2023"
andreas,"Most batteries you can buy from Halfords have a 4 or 5-year warranty, so I can't see how Porsche can decline a warranty claim on a failed 2 year old battery.","July 02, 2023"
GWL,"I may be corrected on this, but I believe the 14.7 volts is a ""charging"" voltage supplied by the alternator  ( In order to charge the battery, the applied charging voltage has to be higher than the battery's nominal 12 volts in order to ""push power"" into the battery).However, when the car is sitting with the engine off (i.e. no charging voltage from the alternator) then it will just show its rated 12v (or slightly lower as there are still systems drawing power even when the car is standing) .Hence I don't think there's a problem.Same sort of thing applies to rechargeable batteries you may use at home. They are, say,  1.5v but the charger will apply, say, 1.75v to them to charge them. However, once charged and removed from the charger, they will provide their nominal 1.5v","July 02, 2023"

Nuclear Nick,"This is normal, the battery is fine. No-load voltage will drop over a few days, into the 11 to 12 volts range while background electrical systems are operating, however the ECU will gradually shut down non essential systems in order to protect the battery capacity and maintain enough power to start the car. Standing no-load voltage is not an indication of remaining battery capacity.

Alfanut,"Correct, it’s not holding its charge very well or something is taking excess current when the car is lying idle (dash cam, immobiliser???). As others have said you can’t really tell the full health of a battery by simply checking the no-load voltage. However, for the battery to fall below 12v in just a few days, which is equates to about 50% discharged, does sound like it’s well past its best. It almost sounds like it’s previously had a deep discharge, with AGM batteries particularly that’s the beginning of the end.Does the stop start function still operate? If the battery is weak the car will restart after only a few seconds as the voltage will have dropped to the starting threshold. Let us know how you get on with the warranty.","July 03, 2023"
Nuclear Nick,How did you arrive at the ‘50% discharged’ figure?,"July 04, 2023"
Alfanut,"Some manufactures publish discharge tables but in general the discharge rate is a pretty steady and gentle slope between 12.8V down to around 12V which is roughly 50% of the capacity used on a lead acid battery. Beyond this things start to drop off rather quickly. There are a number of factors involved, current draw, temperature, etc.Google “agm battery discharge chart” for some more info, for example :-","July 04, 2023"
pmg,fascinating.The graph after 120 hrs/ 5 days confirms the wisdom of leaving an AGM battery on the likes of a CTEK charger if left for any time,"July 04, 2023"
Alfanut,"Correct, a ctek or equivalent is an almost essential tool if leaving the car for extended periods especially on the back of short runs.I also own a motor home and generally AGM batteries (which are in Macan’s) are disliked by motorhomers as they can be badly damaged by a single deep discharge. They need to be treated very well to get anywhere near the stated life out of them- use a ctek! Lithium batteries are much better and I believe Porsche already use them in the Turbo S, 992GT3 & RS. With these you get 95% of the battery capacity available above 12V, hence the battery can be much smaller and lighter for a given Ahr rating. Just a shame they cost a small fortune.","July 04, 2023"
On-Track,"If the voltage shown when driving is 14.7V then the battery is not fully charged. In the fully charged state, the voltage while driving will be 12.8-13.2V. Be aware that charging will resume at varying intervals during a long journey.If the battery is capable of starting the car after two to three weeks of storage then there is not much wrong with it. If my car is unused for more than four weeks, I tend to connect my CTEK charger to bring it back up. Don't forget the immobiliser/car alarm is active if the car is locked and this produces a small but steady drain. Over the years, Porsche have steadily reduced the installed battery capacity from a starting point of 105Ah. They obviously feel that a slightly smaller battery capacity has no effect on performance.","July 04, 2023"

lookalike50,"As I understand it, the thing that makes the big difference is the PDK oil change. I believe (don't quote me) this is due at 4yrs/40000 miles, BUT if your car is low mileage - as mine is - they will postpone this to the 6yr service. @Madelvic it sounds like yours may have been carried out at 4yrs as you have a more 'normal' mileage, hence the 6yr service was seemingly cheaper. @RGS if your 4yr is coming up in March and you've done less than 12K I'd request they scrub the PDK oil change and halve their quote.My car has recently been through its 6yr service with <20K on the clock and that was roughly £1900 including aircon service, drain clearance, brake fluid, engine oil and PDK oil.","January 17, 2023"

Apparently S/Turbo were built with software during production, which was not used during type approval.  So, presumably this mens the vehicles are technically 'illegal'.  It seems to centre around the coasting function, which after update will still be switchable by the driver, but will no longer be automatic when you lift off the accelerator.  'An update to your operating manual will be provided'.So it looks like software A was type approved and software B was installed in the vehicles.

(Assuming all conditions for coasting [as was] are met).If mostly town / village drives, short runs, working through the gears, not getting up to continuous speed much, then likely notice no real difference or effect at all.On long motorway drives, we'll simply now have to remember to change up manually from 6/7 to force it to kick in to get (some) of the same result back.Yes, got my recall letter today.Personally, I think it will produce an overall negligible difference anyway so won't be changing my driving style any time soon","February 28, 2023"

Bluesnose1812,Probably because the state of UK roads is so bad Porsche don't want the suspension bottoming out so much.,"June 28, 2023"
On-Track,"Presumably low is not the default setting because the designers at Porsche think normal is best. Even in normal, the ride height is 10mm lower than that on steel suspension. At high speeds (I think it's 80mph) the suspension automatically moves to low and then reverts to normal when you slow down. So Porsche thinks that it's only at high speeds that there is any aerodynamic difference.Over the years, forum members have put forward the theory that lowering the air suspension reduces roll. My own view is that there is no change in spring rate so reducing the ride height by a few mm will have no effect on roll at any speed achievable on public roads. I think that changing the PASM setting would have a greater effect. Feel free to hold different opinions.","June 28, 2023"
wab172uk,"When I pull up, the car is in low mode, but through individual mode. The car remains low while switched off.It's when I get back in, the car the suddenly starts raising into high setting.

I’ve always run my previous cars this way without issue. What usually happens is the outside ambient temp cools the cabin down enough without the need for A/C, but for some reason it’s blasting heated hot air?

The advice used to be if you wanted to save fuel and not run the aircon all the timme then at least ensure it was still used regularly say once a fortnightThe controls on the Macan allow occupants to make adjustment to the distribution of air within the cabin and to turn the air con off if outside temps below 3% C, in practice the system does this to protect itself.","June 28, 2022"

I personally don’t think it’s an inappropriate question, Or one that deserves the seemly common snarky replies with unhelpful answers such as “stop fiddling” ? Is this the reply I’ll get from Porsche when it goes in? I’m pretty sure it isn’t. Fact of the matter the chap on service at Chester was pretty damn helpful stating it’s Something he’s seen before, let’s hope he’s not referring to customers fiddling with buttons and the fix is to disable them ( buttons or owner you choose)It is my mistake for asking what I considered  a perfectly reasonable question, one deserved of a reasonable answer from anyone that wanted to be helpful. It Seems I was wrong to expect that, but comes as no surprise as I’ve witnessed it on this particular forum time and time again, I just personally find it quite odd behaviour nothing more. As was once written “people are strange”In my life and in the bigger picture these replies are genuinely not an issue to me, I wear my big boy pants daily and can assure you all that no toys or prams where harmed by myself, although I can’t confirm others in this thread didn’t  (my initial reply was more flippant and tongue in cheek)We live and learn. Going forward I think I’ll  stick to contacting Porsche with any issues that may arise from my £83k purchase including any issues resulting from fiddling with buttons, vehicle functionality and Ill Fitting body panels.Think I’ll leave my “initial review of my GTS” In pages safe from harm on my MacBook ffsPeace and love and good luck to you all you helpful funny bunch …Mods feel free to close the thread.","June 29, 2022"
Nella,"Ok, my car is now with OPC.Air con is defective. Other cars have had faults with a sensor which is not a stock item and has to be ordered in. Also they confirmed (again) the sat nav is not working correctly.Other than that the car is an absolute peach, drives like a dream and looks stunning so I'm looking forward to it eventually coming back with those items fixed.Mixed drive in and achieved 30mpg.OPC service from me calling on Friday to this morning has been exemplary.","June 29, 2022"
On-Track,"Like most upmarket cars, the Macan is fitted with ""climate control"". The reason for the """" is that true climate control also controls humidity and that is not normally the case with automobile systems as there is no water injection system to correct over dry air. If the system is left to itself then the car will control the internal temperature to the level set (unless you select high or low). If you turn AC off then it just stops the compressor from cutting in when required. The system should still attempt to cool the car if the internal temperature is higher than the set level. Because it's now using only ambient air to cool the interior then you would normally experience higher fan speeds. If the car is blowing hot air then either the internal temperature is actually lower than the set temperature or there is a fault.The compressor does not run constantly with AC turned on but only if cooling is required or, in colder weather, to remove excessive humidity (usually to help with demisting windows). If the system is working correctly, you don't gain anything by turning the compressor off. Savings were only made with older car systems which had air cooling systems and the compressor ran whenever AC was turned on.","June 29, 2022"
GTB,"I Agree with On-Track and his words above,The system is ""Climate Control"" so apart from the temperature it also looks at the humidity. I have had it in lots of cars, and its best left in full auto position and I never turned it on/off. Only adjustments were for the temp I wanted.Also the response of the system isnt like putting a light switch on/off in other words instant, it takes time for the climate control system to adjust. Other things I have found especially in new cars for a few weeks, higher than normal amount of moisture present, I have always presumed from the manufacturing or more likley delivery process with no climate control on and car left with doors open when its possibly raining/damp. Also as a mad fisherman and especially with hatchbacks where with the tailgate open, boot is open too elements, so cold damp air, but also lots of moisture now from my waders/waterproofs now in the car ""Space"" so misting of windows/screen is worse for a few days until the cliamte system manages to get that damp air out.I would certainly always have the a/c switched on and left in full auto.GTB","June 29, 2022"
Bluesnose1812,Yeah you also have to wind down the windows to get the maximum effect. I don't recommend driving with the doors ajar.,"June 29, 2022"
pmg,And any pano roof shut I assume? and on the rare occasions pano roof open then which off Climate control?Which is why I have never used an opening roof on a  car with climate control and why I wont pay extra for an opening roof. and also why I prefer fixed glass roofs where available as in the Cayenne Coupe,"June 29, 2022"
GTB,"PMG,In a word yes, in my previous cars, Im sure if the sunroof or pano roof was opened in anyway, it automatically disconnected the ""Cooling"" part of the climate control as others have said they system is then trying to cool the world and that just aint going to happen. Similar happens in lots of hotels and for those of you with air conditioning in your home, open the patio doors and the a/c switches off on the cooling function.GTB","June 29, 2022"

Bluesnose1812,I assumed you had a bit of common sense. Having spent 7 years in Saudi Arabia I know the fastest way to cool a car that is over 50° is to open all the windows. Put the a/c onto max until it pipes through cold air. Believe it or not but aircon is not instant. Once the cold air is flowing close all windows. That Dear Sir is how it works.,"June 29, 2022"
Nella,"Or how about spec a pano, ACC (auto pilot or whatever it is) and ASR (speed limit reader or whatever that is called).Open roof, turn all the tech on and stand up and let the car drive itself.Just don’t do this if you live in Scotland.","June 29, 2022"
Nella,"Car fixed. Faulty air conditioning pressure sensor replaced under warranty. A few cars have had this issue apparently so they knew what to look for.And from the OPC it's nothing to do with pressing the wrong knobs and you don't have to have the A/C on all the time to make it work properly (nor have to have a pano for it to work properly either)?!?!?!?No news on real time sat nav other than Germany are looking at this still and it does affect some other cars.Unfortunately now a crack has appeared on the B post trim on the from passenger door which apparently is a known fault and will be replaced under warranty at some time in the future.I'm hoping that as that is the 3rd fault I get no more!!!Other than that it is epic to drive and seems to loosen up everyday.ps I had a Cayanne for the day and was so glad to get back to my GTS. Cayanne felt mahoosive, very snappy in the gears, but was a demo so I'm guessing the PDK thinks everyone wants to race it, and it just wallowed round corners. Wasn't as much fun and drank fuel!!!!!","June 30, 2022"
TheTraveller,"I very often, adjust the heat settings on my AC. If out cycling or hiking, when getting back to my car. It can be roasting in the cabin on a hot day, ( dont want to drop all the windows, even ever so slightly on a hot day, while away from car). Get back in, set the control to lowest temp, below 16.5c, and the AC blows as cold as the North Wind, even from start.I really cant fault that system in any way.But the AC, should be left on all the time, and let that control the temp. It doesn't like being unused.","June 30, 2022"
Jobbo,"I've thoroughly enjoyed reading people's opinions on spec on this forum, although I was already pretty set on the minimum spec I wanted.  My wife let me choose the options once she'd decided on colour scheme (black on black); I've posted photos in the Members Gallery forum so won't spam them again, but here's a different photo of the interior:And the Porsche Code:http://www.porsche-code.com/PPMPKF77You never quite know whether you've picked options which work until your car turns up, so I thought I'd add my feelings on the spec I chose (and items I considered but omitted) after seeing and driving it:- T engine rather than S.  We were constrained here; to have the car now, only a T was available to us; and the fact that many options are cheaper to add to the T, and locking in before the price rise, made it a good deal.  So I'm not unhappy that we got a T but my everyday car is a current Audi S6 diesel and in contrast the 2.0T feels lacking in immediate low-rev response.  Obviously needs running in before I can extend it fully, and I haven't tried the Sport/Sports Plus modes which no doubt change the throttle map.  I'd definitely prefer an S, but in the same spec and with price rise it would have been £10k+ more and a longer wait.  Might put an order in for an S in 2024...- T exterior look.  I removed the agate grey bits because in my view, while they look great with a lighter colour they don't suit darker paint.  I do like the grey badging on the rear though.- Extended black leather with contrasting crayon stitching and seatbelts.  In no way is the contrast stitching worth £1k or so more than the black stitching - I bet I don't notice it after today.  If it were my colour choice, I'd have gone pebble/black inside, but it wasn'tIs extended leather worth it?  Yes, and no - because there are still plenty of bits which aren't leather such as the bottoms of the doors, the trim round the seat bases, the sport chrono clock. I think I would go for the standard leather package (to get the leather dash) and race-tex headlining for more of a visible luxury feel.  Or go all-out with all the additional leather items on the options list, if I felt very flush.- Steel springs with PASM (standard) rather than air.  The ride is amazingly good.   Better on the 21""s than my Audi S6 on 20""s (also steel springs with adaptive suspension).  The lowered ride height on the T is neither here nor there (the seat can be moved up and down way more than 15mm) but probably makes it easier for my wife and I to get in (both being under 5'6"").  I wondered if I would miss air, particularly since I had it on a few cars myself previously (e.g. Audi Allroad) but so far I don't see any need for it - might be different if we were to go green-laning...- no Bose or Burmester.  I have B&O in my Audi and while it sounds good, the Macan sounds equally good so far.  It doesn't have DSP which gives the spatial 3D effect that is the unique selling point of all these upgraded systems, and it's fine without.  Bass is perfectly adequate; I might even turn it down one notch.  I say this as someone who loves hi-fi but I've always been more of a fan of talented small speakers (such as my Spendor SA1s) or Quad ESLs than big boxes.- Power steering plus: it is relaxed to cruise around at low speed.  I haven't tried one without to compare, unfortunately, but I'd spec it again because I'm happy with it.- GT steering wheel: small, tactile, rather nice - but I don't like the allen bolts in the button sections and I actively dislike the stitched insert at the top which is clearly intended to be a contrasting colour in a GT3.  I would stick with the standard wheel if I bought an S.- 14 way comfort seats.  The memory is a no-brainer for my wife and I because we sit in such different positions.  Quite happy with these over the sports seats; I love the fact that there's passenger seat memory too.  BMW and Audi seem to offer driver memory only while Merc and Porsche do both sides, which is so much better.- Surround view.  Virtually the first thing I did with this was to put it into panoramic rear camera only mode, so I think I could make a saving here.  Hoping the surround view saves the alloys being kerbed when my wife gets used to it, so consider it an insurance policy- Heated windscreen.  Has to be the least feelgood option when you collect your new car in June!- Interior door/dash trim.  The standard stuff is innocuous and blends in; I'm not a fan of brushed alumium, the wood looks very man-made and the piano black is too shiny so I'm quite happy not to have spent extra here.- Sport chrono.  Came as standard on the T though I wasn't bothered about it.  I'm not a massive fan of the clock in the middle of the dash, and the sport chrono knob on the wheel again looks a bit too much like it wants to be in a GT3 not an SUV.  Not something I'd pay extra for.- No ventilated seats.  But you still get the perforations, so don't let any chocolate fall on them.  I'd probably go for ventilation in future simply because I've just spent 2 weeks away sweating in Ubers round New York and Boston, so it's right at the forefront of my mind.The real surprises for me are the ride quality on 21""s without air and the sound quality without Bose.  So I'm happy that I didn't make any horrendous mistakes by leaving those standard.  I think I went overboard on the interior and could probably have achieved a nice luxurious effect for less money.Edit: completely forgot, the thing that inspired this post - I reckon I should have ordered colour crest centre caps for the wheels.  At least that's an easy upgrade!","June 26, 2023"

BZR81,Fully agree with your comments regarding the price of an S. A lot of the T reviews say why wouldn’t you just get an S for £1k more. If you spec up two similar looking cars the S suddenly jumps to a lot more than the T. Gives people the option I suppose to go for power or trim.My Porsche survey dropped into my inbox today and one of the things I commented on was that it’d be nice if the T was tuned a bit higher than the base eg 300bhp. That would sit it nicely between the base and the S.,"June 26, 2023"

TK421,"Ordered this back in October 21, after many config tweaks and having lived with Crayon on the last one I went for the same again with more performance oriented options including the GTS package amongst others, oh and lots of carbon.First impressions is it feels so much better bolted together than the 22 GTS, it’s also louder, both me and the SE agreed it has more noise from the exhaust, normal sounds more like sport on the last one, it’s also rasps on gear shift. Although I’m still running in, it also feels livelier than the last, can’t believe this is all down to the GTS package add on which the last one didn’t have, but this one feels more GTS than the last. I need more time behind the wheel but there’s definitely a performance difference. Handling feels a notch up as well, especially mid corner and pulling out of bends under throttle, no doubt PTV but also the super sticky Corsa’s.Am I back in love with the GTS? I think I am, didn’t realise how much I missed it until I got behind the wheel. I looked for every alternative to the Macan GTS and always ended up back at the GTS, there genuinely is nothing else like it on the market that ticks every box as well as the Macan GTS.

TK421,"Truth be told if I hadn’t had this one on order from 2021 I sadly wouldn’t have got chance to revisit. Glad to say this 23 GTS feels so much better. Daft things like the wiper rack sound quieter (we had what felt like a monsoon last week) unlike the 22 GTS which sounded like a cortina. Fit and finish, panel gaps are tighter, this car feel more Porsche. My expectations, mainly based on my previous experience, weren’t very high at all, and I’m glad to say I’m very surprised. The images genuinely don’t do it any justice, it’s a truly stunning car, the GTS package bits add so much to the look but also the drivability. I was hoping the car didn’t do the kangaroo of the driveway when turning right, alas it still does, but I’m impressed with this one, especially the sound, so much different than the last one. Lots more pops, burbles and rasp on gear change.I agree on the options especially the GTS, having had one without I’d say go for the drivers performance enhancing options, the GTS package actually represents good value for money (doesn’t sound right I know) racetex headlining is beautiful. Was unsure on the racetex steering wheel, given the option I would have gone Leather, but it grips really nicely and stays cool in the heat. So I’m happy with that.

TK421,To be fair it’s widely reported on panel gap issues and obviously the water feature. All covid cars.

nickjwilliams,"I am loving my Macan and feel privileged to have owned a Porsche.My only niggle is around the tech not being as up to date as other manufacturers.- Mobile app is not particularly informative, is clunky and does not have much functionality- The tracker app - well it does nothing apart from put in valet mode really!Now on to the PCM and wireless Apple CarPlay - my last 2 cars - both BMW, and a 2019 RRS have all had good sized screens (like my 2022 Macan) - however they have displayed the Carplay full screen with no distortion of image or stretching of icons. The Macan from fatcory only displays the CarPlay in a small window, I appreciate that the currrent Cayenne, Panamera, Taycan etc have all had more recent refreshes and use newer than PCM5 and are capable of full screen CarPlay in HD. The Macan was refreshed around 2020 I believe so surprised not updated then, and I know the new Macan will be announced late 2023 and available in 2024 (if pre-ordered, or 2025 if ordering now probably!) - these will I am sure have the same full screen capability of CarPlay - maybe even more options as announced as API's by Apple.Maybe I am moaning like the old man that I am - but I did some research into options here as I have had coding done on other cars - Merc, Audi etc. in the past - there are companies online charging anything from £300 up to £500 to code the PCM - I found someone who could do it remotely and although nervous as was priced much cheaper, I bit the bullet and went ahead - I am so pleased with the result and the way it was done. Happy to share more details as required as this is not a sales pitch - but from around $200 (US Dollars) the mod can be done quite quickly.Drop me a PM if you want to know more. This is not an advert - just for interest to save people money if they are as fussy as me and want a better CarPlay experience in their car. (@admins - please remove if breaching any rules).They do other mods too - Android Auto (wired), plus earlier PCM version options too.Thanks & regards,NickW","June 21, 2023"

nickjwilliams,"This guy is from Vietnam.I used Facebook Messenger and FaceTime to communicate with him. His spoken English is not great but his gf/wife helps translate - worked OK. His written English is fine (probably uses a translation tool).You will need an SD card (that will fit in the SD-Card slot of your Macan) of minimum 4GB. It will need to be freshly formatted and blank. Also a Windows laptop with Ethernet port, an ethernet cable and then a specific D-Link Ethernet to USB adapter (as Porsche is fussy on what works with it!) and a USB-A to USB-C adapter to plug in to the USB-1 in arm rest. You will need to be wirelessly connected to the internet and best that your laptop has an SD-Card slot too (mine didn't but worked around it). You will also need the latest Teamviewer software installed.Once plugged together and in contact by Facetime (disconnect your phone from car bluetooth first so you keep the video showing) he will transfer some files to your computer which will go on to the SD Card plugged in to your laptop. Then the SD-Card is removed and plugged in to the SD card slot in the car armrest. He will then talk you through the steps to do on the PCM display - takes about 5 to 10 mins - then he will do some work in back ground. Once complete then can disconnect everything. I found I needed to tuen the car off an leave for a few mins (whilst I took everything back in to the house!) and then started up and works great.Payment was via Paypal F&F afterwards.Let me know if you want me to put you in contact with him or need anything else from me to help your decision.

PJV997,"It does sound like quite a faff.  Do the 2023 Macans only show CarPlay in partial screen mode?On my M6, I used Bimmertech to add CarPlay which wasn’t originally specced on my car.  I received a file attached to an e-mail which I could then download to a clean USB stick and had a set of written instructions to follow.  It was quite straightforward and I felt comfortable from an IT security perspective with the process due to the reputation in BMW circles of Bimmertech.With an individual undertaking a process as you describe, it does feel less IT secure (but I am not in any way shape or form an expert in the field).  If my incoming Macan doesn’t do the full screen option, I don’t think I’d feel comfortable going down this particular  route.Final point, if there is a manufacture software update during a service and you lose the upgrade/modification you have paid for, will the supplier reinstall for free?","June 22, 2023"
nickjwilliams,"I may have labooured the process - always possible in words - it's quite straight forward - was done in under 20 minutes - probably could be done in 10 from opening car door! I may not have been as organised as I could have been.Appreciate concerns  on security - had considered that and reduced risk by using a clean laptop.It is a personal choice and many don't like Apple car Play (and many don't like Apple at all) - so not for them for sure. For those that do like Apple and Car Play - as they probably know - you can just display the apps you want on the CarPlay screen. Also can still flip between full screen and windowed - so can be best of both worlds. I personally use Waze and it's alerts a lot so useful to see clearly which was my goal. Looks like PCM6 implementation.I too had Mercs - and had coding done to them to add in certain disabled features that had the EU not stuck their beaks in then would have been enabled out of factory - that had gone smoothly hence confidence to ""play"" with my 6 month old Macan. A risk but my choice. One I am pleased I took.I am told that there should be no affect on this coded capability of Full Screen HD Car Play by regular Porsche PCM updates.Incidentally the screen (and size/display) is different on 2017 (Gen2 I believe) cars to Gen 3 (which are wider screens - hence the improvement may be more noticeable - or maybe more intrusive).Personal choices - was only posting for peoples info if they felt the same as me as I had implemented a lower cost way to make my experience of this great car better.","June 22, 2023"

crockers,"Almost 3 months in and 3000 miles on the clock - thought it was about time to give my views on the T.I’m not going to go into the 4 v 6 debate as it’s a no brainer that the 6 has substantially more power and a better sounding vocal cord. But the 4 isn’t “weedy”. I’ve only once found it lacking and that was going over the Hardknot pass. Not an everyday occurrence.I find the 8 way GTS seats extremely comfortable, and wrapped in Pebble look and feel exquisite. The GT smaller steering wheel is very nice.I find the speedo a waste of a dial as I use the digital display as it’s far more user friendly.I have driven an S but stuck with the T because I would have had to strip the S or pay out extra £000s which I didn’t want to do.Cruising up a motorway at around 75-76 gives me 35+ to a gallon. Going over the hardknot gave me low to mid 20s. But on the whole I rarely see less than 30. Not brilliant but acceptable.Handling is amazing. Can’t get over how well it grips. Rarely see the power move to the front. Going up the Hardnot was a 50/50 split.Adaptive cruise and lane keep assist are good but not as good as the Volvo Pilot Assist. The 360 camera is very useful - but I’m not overly impressed with the sharpness of the images. To be fair the technology and safety equipment is not in the same league as Volvos but the I knew that when changing. Ride quality and road handling easily make up for this.The “Porsche app and stuff” is total garbage - other Manufacturers are streets ahead. My Volvo was 4 years old and I could remotely lock and unlock the car. Send it routes. Also read off fuel etc. it also had a log with maps to show journeys done and it would send me notifications when the car was unlocked. Handy once when it was valet parked and he hadn’t locked it.The £200 Porsche logo door lights were a waste of money.Load management system brilliant.But every time I drive it - those niggles go onto the back burner.The quality of the fit and finish is superior to the Volvos - and that was impressive Scandi minimalist.Do I regret buying it - no. I love looking as I think it looks stunning - something I couldn’t say about the XC60.  Not that that was bad looking - just not a beauty.","June 20, 2023"

My fist proper drive out I had to remind myself I was in a 1.8T SUV, as I ended up starting to drive it like a Hot hatch.The speedo. Yeah, I never look at it either. But I think it's because it to the side, small, and goes in weird increments. But TBF I rarely look at the speedo on my other car, as the digital display is easier to look at.Never bothered looking at the Porsche app, and never looked at or use my BMW one, or my Toyota one. Think they're all a gimmick and bring nothing to the ownership experience. An app for the sake of having an app.I also think the Macan has something over it's rivals. The badge.

r1flyguy,"So I’ve had a few Porsches over the years including a beautiful 991.1TTS but never have I suffered so much road rage and inconsiderate driving since owning the new Macan GTS.Let me put a little context to the statement.I don’t drive like a boy racer, I can make progress like the best of them but generally if it’s 30 I do 30, 40, I do 40, etc unless the odd overtake permits safe progress.My Macan is now 9 months old and shows a little over 2500 miles and this week is the first time I’ve even used the sports exhaust button!! Well actually my 12 year old wanted to hear it, generally I don’t use it.My my miles are personal use, no commuting but I do school runs etc. over the last few months I have constantly had inconsiderate drivers try to stop me filtering where a particular road goes from 2 lanes to 1, every other car ahead of me takes turns to merge when it’s my turn I get a second car try to force me out of turn! Most recently yesterday and that was by a silver haired female driver!!! This happens regularly as this particular road is on the school run route.This morning, taking my 12 year old to school I had to pull out of a junction onto a dual carriageway, the nearside lane was clear at the time and the offside lane had a couple of cars, I needed to cross into the offside lane as I was turning right at the island just a couple of hundred meters along.As I checked again to my right was a LGV coming along in the nearside lane but would cause no issues to cross and be out of his way so I did, a few moments later lorry came by on my nearside and then the horn sounds!!  The traffic ahead of me had stopped so obviously I did too, the lorry pulled up alongside me and the abuse started!! Swearing and shouting so loudly and aggressively I thought he was going to have mental breakdown!!! All in front of my son!! I just looked up at him and and thought WTAF!!!!!These are just a couple of issues but it’s nearly every time I take the Macan out!Frankly I’m sick of it and cannot understand WTF is wrong with people these days as I’ve never had these issues before.I got home and chatted with SWMBO and her response was get rid of the Macan and go back to a 911.Suffice to say this afternoon I picked my lad up from school in the 1 series, and apart from some old twat in an X5 who constantly drove between 2 lanes to stop people passing him I had no issues!!I am disillusioned to be honest, I don’t need the car being a target and I don’t need the abuse in front of my son! He would love me to be back in a 911 & I’m seriously considering it!!End of my rant.","June 06, 2023"
Plyphon,"Blimey, sounds like carnage up the roads in Worcestershire!I've not had anything yet in my Macan GTS.

kalniel,"I'm not sure how any of that is related to or the fault of the Macan!Many people are just rude and inconsiderate. Unfortunately they stand out in the memory more than those who are otherwise inclined. The solution isn't to get rid of the Macan (as you'll inevitably still suffer the same but now be minus a rather nice car), but instead try not to worry about it. Continue to drive respectfully and defensively and then let go of the things you can't control. Your blood pressure will thank you.","June 06, 2023"
penport,+1 think positively !!Turning right out of my driveway involves somewhat of a leap of faith as there's a corner 70 metres away and cars come round there at a rate of knots sometimes (30mph limit supposedly). I went through a phase of pulling out just before a screamer came round the bend every single time.....spoke to SWMBO who pointed out I was now expecting it to happen.....switched to expecting it to be nice and clear and hey presto!! It really does work (....cue the sceptics....).I've never had issues as you describe in the Macan although probably foolishly I let such behaviour put me off when experienced constantly on a test drive of a Cayman several years ago.,"June 06, 2023"
pstrat,"One would tend to think that the school run time is busier, and hence be more likely to encounter all sorts of twats.I commute to Hammersmith and there's all sorts of moronic drivers about I encounter on the daily.

Granted my kid isn't in the car so if I get grief I would not hesitate giving it back but that is rare. I wouldn't let these clowns cloud my thoughts on the car.Easy to say but try not to let it affect your ownership.

Three of my pet hates from these plonker drivers relate to poor lane discipline, poor signalling at roundabouts , and travelling past parked cars on your left causing oncoming drivers to slow down needlessly when the the plonker should have given way in the first place. The list could go on! I’m a Driving Examiner & see how poor driving is everyday.My wife drives the Macan & I agree with the OP about the aggressive attitude of other drivers to us. But whenever I drive my 718 Cayman I find the complete opposite! I don’t know whether it’s because of the great looking design of the car, like the 911, or because of the colour (Racing Yellow) but I find many drivers don’t pull out in front of me, beckon me out of junctions with courtesy & generally keep well away. I even get some drivers stopped alongside me at junctions who wind their windows down & tell me what a fantastic car I have!Generally driving standards are pretty poor these days & I don’t believe it’s the Macan causing problems to us.

wab172uk,"As my car is sat waiting for an Amp to be delivered so I can collect. We had a long weekend away booked up in Northumberland. Not wanting to take a GR-Yaris or works van, I asked my OPC if they had a car we could borrow for 4 days. Thankfully, they let us have their recent Macan S demo car.Car came in Crayon, which I like, but certainly looks better on a 911 than a Macan. I did consider this colour, but pleased I never ordered it.The car came with passive suspension, which I have to say, given it came with 21"" wheels, the ride was brilliant. I think if I'd test driven a Macan S with passive suspension, I don't think I'd have ticked air suspension. The ride was fantastic in normal. Stiffen things up, and yes, you could feel if becoming harsher. Obviously the air set-up will be much smoother, but I ticked air as 1) the test drive I originally had came with it, and the ride was brilliant, and 2) As I'd read on here people saying the ride with passive and 21"" wheels was unbearable. Not sure that is the case, and I certainly could have lived without air if I was on a budget.It came with extended leather and contracting stitching. I ticked extended leather, but not contrasting stitching, which I kind of regret now, as it certainly lifts the cabin.Things I wished I'd ordered after this test drive. The 3D camera. I was sceptical at first, but after using it just a few times, I really wish I'd ticked it. The over head view is amazing. Damn. Also adaptive cruise control. I only ticked standard, but recently the roads around where I live are full of road works and average speed camera's. So it does come in handy. Double damn.Still a major negative for me is the driving position. The peddles just don't sit right. Brake peddle too close compared to the throttle. Makes getting my legs right awkward. Plus for me, the steering wheel doesn't come out far enough. To get arms just as I want them, the brake peddle is far too close making braking awkward and made my ankle ache. The driving position in my old X3 was far far superior. Maybe once I collect mine, and fiddle with the seat position, things might improve. Just shows what an extended test drive can reveal.I also didn't think it felt that fast. Maybe as the car was using regular E10 fuel rather than V-Power. The original S I test drove back in June felt far stronger. Strange.Bit annoying dropping it off and catching a glimpse of my car parked up in the storage area. Just want to collect mine ASAP. Been a month now it's been at the OPC.We are way for a weeks holiday in Scotland at the beginning of June.  I don't have much hope we'll be taking my car. I've asked them to pencil in the demo car again, as I don't really think I should be hiring a car, when mine is sat there.We did find the boot larger than the X3 which we were surprised about give the X3 seams to be a slightly bigger car. But we got more things in than normal. So that was nice.Pic of the car included.","April 26, 2023"

That said PASM is standard on the S and GTS so its a moot point.I also note that you wish you had included ACC and Surround Cam, well again its a case of advice is freely given here and again it is not followed.I usually suggest:-PASM14/18 way seatsSpare wheelPS+Surround CamACCI also point out that standard Cruise Control is the same constant speed system as was fitted to cars in the Eighties, and that ACC is variable and includes the Emergency Brake Assist system.So anyone reading this who has not yet locked down their spec, do try out plenty of Macan’s and spend time looking and trying the includes items that are optional fitments to ensure you get your spec as you want it.","April 26, 2023"

No explanation as to why I was kept waiting, receptionist went to check a few times, each time telling me he will be down in a minute.At the very least if he popped down for 10 seconds to say something along the lines of ""I'm really sorry to keep you waiting, due to XYZ, I need another 5/10/15/20/65 minutes etc"" then I might have been okay.But I'm sat there feeling like an absolute muppet who has nothing better to do than wait over an hour to see an SE, for a pre-booked appointment, begging to part with close to 6 figures for the privilege of being able to place an order for a new Porsche.After waiting for over an hour, I just left and told the receptionist to let the SE know that I will reschedule. Been over an hour since then (it's an hour's drive away) and I haven't even received as much as a phone call to apologise.This is my first time buying a Porsche, so I am not sure if this is standard practice, I never had such an experience when buying BMWs or any other car before.In fact, I have never heard of any salesman in any industry be it cars or whatnot, keeping their clients that came in to place a purchase order waiting for more than an hour with not so much as a brief pop down, or even an explanation.Do I have unrealistic expectations for the bare minimum etiquette?Or is this a standard Porsche Snobery thing that I need to learn to deal with if I still want to buy a car?I thought buying a luxury car would also mean a luxury purchase experience, not made to feel like a right muppet.Totally put me off the whole experience and made me reconsider if buying a Macan is the right thing to do.(Their coffee machine was not working, so didn't even get to try these famous free Porsche coffee and pastries that you guys have talked so fondly about either!)","June 14, 2023"

Arranged an appointment and test drive at my local Mitsubishi dealership, only to be ignored, and ignored. Accepted he may be busy, but at around 30 minutes I was off. No phone call back from SE afterwards or nothing.

Tidesurge2,"Definitely a Porsche snobbery. One OPC that I went to made me feel like he was doing me a favour by letting me buy a car from him. Needless to say I went elsewhere. Another example that I have encountered was when I was with a SE looking at the different wheels and a guy came in who was obviously a regular and they probably earned lots more money of him than they were going to with little old me and my Macan, so I was sort of passed along to some random SE who was obviously having his lunch, looked very pissed with me asking questions and couldn’t really be bothered, I nearly walked again but they threw in a car cover, winter mats and a USB cable to get my order, Wow!

Everyone can get things wrong so I would perhaps give them a chance to redeem themselves, if you're happy with their performance and want to proceed, place the order, if not go to another OPC.

Whilst i haven't experienced service as bad as you, i have not been impressed at all by any visit to an OPC over my 18 month experience of OPC's. I have come to accept it and won't use them unless I absolutely have to. You would think at the price point of their cars and their service charge rates, you would get a premium service. Not so.Use this OPC for their 48 hour test drive, give it a good thrashing and do plenty of miles. Sit there asking all the questions and going through the configurator to get your code. Then ask to speak to the dealership principal and explain that you will be placing your order with the next nearest OPC due to the unacceptable and rude service you received on your initial arranged appointment.

Rather spend his time dealing with a guy who makes him lots of commission, than dealing with Joe Bloggs who may or may not buy a Macan.You can understand in one way. SE's make money through commission and need to keep their good customers happy. But at the very least if he knew he was going to be massively delayed, he should have ask another SE to take over.

Guildford OPC are nearest to me but I have had real issues getting any level of service from an SE over maybe 4 visits in the past couple of years.  The result is that I have placed deposits for a new Boxster GTS and Macan GTS with Reading OPC with delivery due August and October this year.  Also, when I decided to buy a Turbo Macan as an interim car earlier in the year, I bought a car that Guildford had for sale but through my Reading SE (after Guildford failed to follow up a physical visit and couple of phone calls).","June 15, 2023"

The car was actually being prepped at Reading so when Guildford failed to properly respond to my enquiries I contacted my Reading SE to go over and see the car.  He was actually running late by about 30 minutes but I was told on arrival and was provided with lunch while I waited.On my new car orders, so far everything has gone as planned.

Take home a Macan GTS for the 48-hour test drive they offered to make up for last time3. Place an order to get on the allocation waiting listI still want the GTS, but given the long wait time, the plan was to place an order today for the S, spend the weekend trying the GTS, and determine if the extra wait time is worth it or not.Surprisingly (although I guess I should have known better) they didn't have a GTS available to demo as agreed, nor did they have any Macan (base, T, S, or GTS) for me to take home for the 48-hour extended test drive that they themselves have offered to me.In fact, the SE denied we agreed on any such thing until I showed him his own email confirming the date, time, exactly what we are doing today, and what time I was dropping the car back on Monday (10 am if anyone is interested).I did get to still test drive the Macan S for half an hour, but come on....... Why offer something to me unprompted, and then deny it, and then be like ""oh yeah"" when shown his own email, and a subsequent confirmation email later?Suffice to say action number 3. (placing an order) did not happen today.I didn't make a fuss over it though, only showed him his email as I didn't want to look like a lying muppet, just told him not to worry, and kept it amicable, had a chat after the test drive and left.But I do not see myself ever going back there or ordering a car from them in the future.","June 17, 2023"

I’d also point out that (1) I’d be placing an order with another dealer and (2) the whole episode has been shared and discussed on a busy Porsche forum.I know I would be very unlikely to get any material benefit from such correspondence, but it would make me feel better and maybe the SE will get some training/advice/bo**ocking.","June 17, 2023"
wab172uk,"I’d agree with all of that. Pretty shocking behaviour from the SE, who clearly is either very arrogant or only likes dealing with high net worth individuals.My very first SE who I ordered my S with was a bit like this. Promising a test drive but then never replying to my email when I tried to confirm a date. I felt now he had my order I was unimportant to him. I eventually got one, and it was for the whole day. I wouldn’t accept a half hour test drive on any car I was thinking of buying.Thankfully he left / was sacked (who knows) and I was appointed another SE who’d just come from a local BMW dealership. He was completely different, and just goes to show how certain SE’s can make the buying experience either great or a nightmare.As you say, order from another dealer, but let the dealer principle of this one know that you have ordered elsewhere purely based on how you have been treated by the SE. He may not care, but then again it may make you feel better.I have noticed over the years, SE come and go all the time. Not many are there for year after year.","June 18, 2023"
pmg,"I agree the experience is awful and does not put the particular OPC in a good light. However it may not totally be the SE's fault. He may have been let down by colleagues reassigning cars under the control of the garage.In late 2018 my OPC was trying to persuade me to order the then announced Gen2 base rather than wait for a Gen 2 S. i said Iwas not prepared to do that without at least a drive of a Gen 1 base having previously test driven aGen1 S. I arranged a test drive with my contact SE for 2pm one day and turned up on time. it turned out the manager of another non sales department had taken the particular car out at 10 am that morning and had not returned. Eventually when he did so at 345pm I got my test drive. Col will be glad to hear  I much preferred the S I had driven previously and decided to wait until a Gen2 S was available to order.I am very much in agreement with Wab that the dealer principle should be informed of a case as bad as the one in this thread, as  that is the only way there is a chance of improvement.In my case, another OPC ultimately got my car purchase business. My nearest OPC does not accept deposits until a car is announced so I had as a precaution placed a deposit with next nearest. The day the Gen 2 s appeared on the configurator, I sent both OPC's my spec/Porsche code by email. The OPC with deposit confirmed a build slot a week before the nearest replied (SE on holiday) so they got the business although I now use the nearest OPC for serving for convenience and they were most competitive on winter wheel set storage.","June 18, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Thanks guys for the positive support.I’m debating over it, part of me agree that the dealer principle or maybe even Porsche GB should be informed so that they can improve their future customers experiences, as I basically ended up wasting two days being let down each time. I did end up getting a test drive on the Macan S for half an hour as I mentioned, and I’m not expecting some VIP treatment or anything but in this day and age everyone has busy lives and everyone’s time is valuable. I for one have turned up early on both occasions as to uphold my part of being considerate not wanting to waste the OPC/SE’s time either.First time, I know I might be making a bigger deal than it’s worth and being a Karen about it, but I think being made to wait over an hour (when it’s not even an unscheduled walk-in) with zero communication, and to top it all off to blame the receptionist shows there is no consideration on other people’s time. Also emailing me the second I left (probably a “oh shit, my commission just walked out the door”) was another point of annoyance as I was still in the car park or walking to the car park at the time, and had he called me instead I could have still walked back in. I’m one of those who’s not constantly glued to his phone, and having had nothing better to do than be on my phone for an hour, I didn’t think to check my email after I left and before I drove off.Regardless, I though maybe something did go wrong, and I’m overtly being sensitive, blaming the receptionist is major Yuk, but maybe there was something there, I decided to take the SE’s word for it and give the benefit of the doubt, second chance and whatnot and give it another go. I also admit the 48 hour test drive that was offered would have been a great way for me to compare the S and the GTS and also a chance for wife and kids to experience the car and give their feedback from their position in the car before we commit 80 grand.So made the journey back, but despite me virtue signalling about second chances, had it not been for the 48 hour offer, and if it was just that 30 minute test drive I would not have drove all that way in such a hurry nor would I have done it over a weekend either.Got there, second time was a bit better to begin with, he popped over (I was 10 minutes early) and introduced himself, shook my hand and said he will be 5 more minutes, to which I replied no problem take your time.But it went all down hill from there, firstly he reiterated the blame on the receptionists saying last time the receptionists simply forgot to inform him and that’s the honest truth and that they are normally better than that. And then comes the disappearing offer on test drive that I felt lied to, I might be wrong, but I feel like there never was an extended test drive on offer and it was just a way to get me to come back and spend my money with them, oh and one more thing I didn’t mention was the Head of new car sales also joined for a bit pushing me to place a deposit on the spot.Although I did go there with every intention to place my deposit and lock in my spot on the waiting list, I was never doing that after the second let down and being lied straight to my face until the evidence was there in black and white.So yes, the immature side of me did consider escalating this, and not just seek sympathy from fellow members here on this forum.But then I’m all for karma, paying it forward and all that. And do volunteer work when I can etc.Part of me feel like deserved or not, an escalation could be spiteful and not worth potentially ruining someone’s employment over when in the grand scheme of things it’s inconsequential and once I have my Macan in hand in the future, I would have probably forgot all about this already.So right now I’m leaning towards the direction of keeping it classy, forget and move on, find elsewhere to place my order, and just ignore all calls and emails from them going forward.P.S. I found it a little off putting when I was asked what do I do, and I told him the company I work for thinking that was that. And he asked again yes, but what is your title there? Felt that was a bit odd why he felt that was necessary info, and that little look I got… I guess a Director of XYZ is probably like a worm to them given who they probably normally deal with.Or maybe I’m just seeing everything through red tinted glasses after the sour experiences and biased.","June 18, 2023"
wab172uk,"Asking for your job title is very strange. Confirms my suspicions he only likes dealing with high net worth individuals. Probably trying to asses if he things you can actually afford to buy one, or just chancing it for a test drive. Whatever his intent, it was out of order.  We all get asked what we do. All part of conversation and building rapport with someone. But asking for title? N’ah, that’s not right.I don’t think writing to the dealer principal will get the guy sacked, but it may then lead to him having a word with him on customer service. And his lack of it has resulted in the dealership losing an order. Which they care quite a lot about as, just like with the likes of Ford, monthly sales figures count for a lot in terms of perks and financial incentives from Porsche. The principal will want to out perform his nearest OPC’s.So I would write a letter or email, but keep it short and simple. Like you say, you don’t want to come across as a Karen. But bad Customer service should be brought to the dealer principals attention, as the SE will probably do the same to the next person who he deems not worth his effort.","June 18, 2023"
2japs,"My brother had a similar experience a while back when he had an appointment to test drive a VW Tiguan R. Ignored fir 20min then walked out.He sent an email directly to VW UK and boy did that cause the dealership to wake up.

SAC1,"I think that SE's have become very blazey in the last couple of years. With demand exceeding supply and long lead times they've lost sight of the art of good service and communication.In early Feb we drove 35 miles / an hour for an arranged test drive of a new VW. When we arrived and after the initial chat, the SE casually said that they'd sold this demonstrator earlier in the week and had no car for us to test!However I did negotiate a good discount, so put down a £1k refundable deposit. Delivery we were told would take 10 months, so Nov 2023.After several subsequent calls and emails from me to the SE ( never the other way round) we are having a test of their latest new demonstrator this coming Thursday....so 4 months on from ordering. Then the SE told me that ""our"" car has now been built and is due to them in July!!  So no opportunity to add or change the spec, as previously agreed, post the promised test drive.So I emailed  their Sales Manager about this poor service and conduct by the SE. He has agreed to...1. If we like the car then they will hold and register 1st Sept - very earliest that I want it - at the same net price agreed in Feb ( no increase).2. If we do not like ""our"" spec, a fast track of one to our new spec. and at Feb's net pricing.3. If we do not like the model / car, then a full refund of our deposit will be made this Thursday.So yes, worth escalating to senior management.","June 18, 2023"

PJV997,I’m with WAB.Surely good customer service has to be one of the fundamental building blocks of the SE skill set.  One would hope that senior management in the OPC would like to know where they are falling short so they can address poor performance.,"June 18, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Okay, I think you guys are all right.I took everyone’s advice and sent an email to both the dealer principal and Porsche GB.","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Ended up being longer than I wanted but I think I made it clear. Removed real names to protect privacy.Dear Mr. Butler,I am writing to express my dismay at the service at your Porsche Centre South London on Wednesday 14th June, and Saturday 17th June.The intention behind my email is less so as a complaint, and more in the hopes to raise awareness on what a customer may experience at your branch with the hope that future customers that come after me may avoid similar dissatisfaction, and I hope you would also read it as such.Whilst your branch is not my nearest Porsche Centre as I live in xxxxxxx, it has come with a glowing recommendation from a dear friend of mine, having had a good experience with his recent purchase, so after speaking with xxxx over the phone on Saturday 10th June, we arranged an appointment to have a test drive and to place an order on Wednesday 14th of June.As I understand it, the lead time from order to delivery is quite significant, so I arrived for my appointment on 14th June with the full intention to place an order, frankly with or without a test drive to get a spot on the waiting list as soon as possible.However, I was kept waiting for over an hour, with no explanation as to why I was kept waiting, other than the receptionist going to check a few times and each time telling me that he would be here in a minute.For the record, I have given the receptionist cxxxx’s  full name (just in case you have other Robs who work there) and have also given her the time of my appointment and the purpose of my visit to avoid any potential confusion.At 11:05 I left your showroom and asked the receptionist to let xxxx know that I am leaving and might reschedule.Subsequently, when I returned home I found an email from xxxx, received at 11:05 saying he came to get me and I was gone.I can't help but think that he valued his time over mine, and he had better things to do than to keep our appointment in a punctual manner, and only emailed me the moment I left as a potential sale just walked out the door. Given the time stamp of the email I would still have either been walking back to my car, or at the car park, so had he called me instead of leaving me an email, I could have quite easily walked back in.Understandably, an order was unable to be placed that day but having returned home, xxxx gave his excuses and I decided that everyone deserves a second chance, especially given the recommendation your centre came with from my friend.It was however very off-putting when the entire blame was placed on the receptionists, I would have much preferred and would have respected him for doing so had he owned up and given any other excuse or just apologised instead with no excuses given. But I decided to take his word for it and we agreed to give it another go, and to his credit, he has also offered me an extended 48-hour test drive in a Macan S or the GTS (the 2 models I was interested in) to make up for the incident which I did appreciate.A new appointment was now rescheduled for Saturday 17th June at 2:30 pm, for a test drive in a Macan S, to place an order on a new Macan (S or GTS), and for me to take home a Macan GTS so that I can compare the two with a return date and time of Monday 19th June at 10 am agreed in writing.My re-visit on 17th June to his credit started off much better, he popped over in person this time (I was 10 minutes early), introduced himself, shook my hand and apologised for needing 5 more minutes with the previous customer, to which I replied that it was no problem and to take his time. This was the least I expected the first time and would have happily waited on 14th June almost indefinitely had he done the same back then.However, once we got started it was very off-putting again when the blame was re-iterated saying the receptionist last time simply forgot to tell him and that was the ""honest truth"" and that they are much better than that normally. I, and I assume most others would much prefer, and respect someone who owns up to issues regardless of fault and takes the blame even if it was genuinely not his, and protect those that are in lesser positions, that would have been a massive plus for me at least.However, the bigger issue came later when there was no recollection of the 48-hour test drive, and I was given a look of disgust as if I expected things to magically happen. It wasn't until I showed our email exchanges of him offering this (unprompted by me) and later confirming the plan he seemed to remember what I was here for. I have even sent him photos of my driving license in advance, and I fail to understand what exactly we are confirming a drop-off time on Monday for, if not to drop off the car for the extended test drive that was offered.In fairness, I did get to test drive a Macan S for 30 minutes, and the car was lovely I may add, but there was neither a GTS available for me for the extended test drive, nor a quick drive on the day. And no other cars in any variation for me to take and honour the offer of this elusive extended test drive.He did to his credit offer me a 30-minute test drive in a 911 instead, to again ""make up for this mix-up"", to which I politely declined.I came to your dealership on Saturday with the full intention again to place an order and pay my deposit, even despite the new car sales manager also ganging up to put pressure to place a deposit, by this point, I lost any desire to purchase from the South London centre and suffice to say this did not happen.Finally, in the middle of our conversation, I was asked what did I do ""Oh I worked at xxxx"" ??? ""it's a tech company, so you might not have heard of it"".Until this point, I just thought it was small talk/chit chat, but then when I got probed further, ""Yes, but what is your title there?"", I replied to him saying it's Director of Business Development, but I got a very weird uneasy feeling.Is what I do and my title really any importance, and am I being looked down upon by not being a high net worth individual?One positive I may add to my experience though, I thought  xxxx from reception on Saturday was wonderful, and both my kids loved her while they were there.I am sorry that this is coming across as a massive complaint, but I hope by bringing this to your attention there is a chance to improve and remedy so that future customers may be able to avoid similar experiences that I had and have a more pleasant time ordering from your dealership.As for myself, I am unfortunately going to be placing my order at another Porsche Center after this experience.Thank you for your time.Yours sincerely,Xxxxxxxx","June 19, 2023"

FirstSeaLord,"This guy sounds like a right BS artist. Shame you didn't get the contact that your friend (who recommended South London) had dealt with. Unsurprisingly, have found that there can be a big difference in individuals within the same dealership / groupIf you get a decent reply, maybe say you'd like to start again with a different salesperson. As others have said here, you'll likely get some great treatment from a more professional contact - and some goodies thrown in when you order.","June 19, 2023"
wab172uk,"Sounds a bit ""Karen"" to me !!!!!Only joking. Good email.I disagree with others regarding taking the bit out about placing an order elsewhere. It's Porsche, not Ford or BMW. They'll not suddenly offer you X% discount on a new GTS. For me, once you've given them 2 chances, that's it. They could chuck in free paint protection, but why should you then give that dealership, and that salesman your business? They've treated you badly, and every action has a reaction.Even if the dealer principal phones you up begging for another chance and he'll deal with you personally, I'd still decline. They'll learn more by the lost business than chucking in a few incentives to get the sale on the third attempt.","June 19, 2023"
Skyway,Great response,"June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Thank you, guys,I know it ended up as a bit of a Karen email, and way longer than necessary, I admit being succinct has never been my strong suit.I agree with Wab, I know they might try and make up for this with some incentives, but I lost all interest to order from them after the second time. I would rather pay a little extra for hopefully a stress-free experience, instead of getting a bit of discount from a place that I have lost my trust in.Given the purpose of the email was for the dealer principal to be aware of these issues in his showroom, so that others that come after me may have a better experience, and not for the purpose of extracting a discount, I felt it was best to be detailed and provide context to why the failure was as disappointing as it was.So this morning the dealer principal replied back,Good morning Mr xxxxPlease accept my sincere apologies and I appreciate your feedback, clearly this is disappointing to hear and on my return to work on Wednesday 21st June  I will complete a full review with Rob and the management team.In the meantime I would be happy to call you a convenient time today or ahead of my return on Wednesday.If you are in a position to take my call today please could you kindly provide me with a convenient time and best contact number, alternatively my mobile number is xxxxx xxxxxx and would be happy to take your call at any time today.Once again please accept my sincere apologies.Kindest regardsChrisAnd I closed this chapter of my inner Karen with:Good morning Chris,Thank you for your prompt reply.You are totally welcome to call me at any time, however, I don't think a call would be absolutely necessary.From your email I assume you are currently away on holiday, apologies for dropping this feedback in the middle of your break.I hope you have a great holiday and I hope I haven't ruined your last few days of it.Thank youBest regards,xxxxxNow it's time to move on....Having said all that as I was typing this out, I just got a super exciting phone call with a piece of great news to update!!I'll post this update on my other thread here, where I think it might be more relevant than on this thread.viewtopic.php?t=13449","June 19, 2023"

MoonageMin,"I will do, but things actually worked out in the best possible way.Copy and paste below from my other thread to save you guys from jumping over to that linkviewtopic.php?p=271212#p271212UpdateI just had a call back from an OPC that I sent an enquiry email to regarding an approved used car they had on sale that I found through the main Porsche website.Some exciting news, they had someone cancel an order for a Macan GTS with a build slot already allocated to them for September.It's worth highlighting that this is September 2023, not September 2024!It even has a slim window for me to change to my specs before it gets locked.So I have just placed my deposit with them and I am about to send them my specs to lock in.Any thoughts or advise on the spec below guys?https://configurator.porsche.com/porsche-code/PR94MF53I know I went from wanting a Macan to a Macan S, and then to a Python green GTS, and now settling on a Carrara white Macan GTS. But I think this might be the perfect build for me now and save the python green for a subsequent 911 instead.For those who followed my other thread, I guess this might be karma and if it does all work out as planned for a brand new GTS built on that September 2023 allocation, everything worked out in the most amazing fashion!-end of copy paste-","June 19, 2023"

MoonageMin,"Thank you Wabp.s. I know you were joking, but yeah I did feel a bit bad regardless for complaining when I sent that email off last night.","June 19, 2023"
wab172uk,"Very good news regarding the cancelled order. I assume it's with another dealership then?Car specs are always a personal choice, so any comments would be purely personal taste ... but here we go !I'm not a fan of the alloys, and from personal experience, I can confirm a huge amount of brake dust comes off the brakes and onto the alloys. They will be a bitch to keep clean.I do like the black side blades on the doors, as it breaks up the doors and (for me) looks more sporty. I looked at the colour match on a Macan in the showroom, and in the flesh they look a bit naff, as they look fake. Would look far better if the doors could come without them totally. They look all after thought.I like roof bars as (to me) they add something to the styling. But it's money for something cosmetic only.I do also think White with White interior is a all White on the night, lol. But like I say, it's all personal taste.Pan Sunroof would brighten the interior up, but TBH I could have probably done without it myself.Smoking pack is worth the £33, as it's somewhere to keep keys etc in the car.If available, I'd tick BOSE, as slightly better sound over standard is always welcome with some good tunes on.If I could spec mine again, I'd go for the acoustic glass. I had this on my X3, and I can now feel the hot sunshine coming though on the Macan. But it's quite expensive at £1152.00.Can't see if you have ticked the 75l fuel tank, but well worth it if you haven't,Personally, I'd rather have a higher spec S than compromising on the GTS spec. But it just depends if this is a long termer, or just something for 2-3 years.But good luck getting your final spec locked in. September ain't far away !","June 19, 2023"
Plyphon,"I like that you signed the email off with a nice row of kisses xxxxxThat's a huge win to get that Macan GTS slot - go for it, you won't be disappointed.","June 19, 2023"
Plyphon,"As a GTS owner myself here is my feedback on your build:- White on white is a bit much for me, but that's entirely subjective, if that speaks to you then crack on, sure has some 'pop' to it!- Someone correct me if i'm wrong but the 'Comfort 14 way' seats are less 'sporty' than the 'GTS Sport Seats' in that they have a smaller side bolster. The 'standard' 8 way seats are in-fact GTS specific. I find them perfectly comfortable and very hugging but others wouldn't dare even sit in a Macan without the 14/18 ways.- I love my heated GT steering wheel, great option.- I find the ACC a useful addition and wouldn't be without it now. You might want to consider adding this if resale is a concern.- Likewise with Bose - if resale is a concern this is a big draw to the car, but if not then i'm unsure it matters. I've heard the basic system is fine.","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Thanks, Wab again for the thoughts on my spec, really appreciate it.Yup, it's with another dealership, just got super lucky with the timing and all, and if this all does work out as they say and I get my GTS almost a year earlier than if I joined the back of the queue, I would also well recommend others to try calling around different dealerships before ordering to check if any has a cancelled allocation. In my situation, I just got lucky with the 1 email I sent to the 1 dealership to enquire about a used car they had and it transformed into a new car order.Regarding your thoughts, I do like the look of the satin black GT wheels the most and would pay extra for it, but it's only available in combination with the GT sports package, and in lieu of that I thought I would just keep the standard 21"" Spyders in satin black.But maybe something to reconsider regarding washing and maintenance.Thanks for the info on the sideblades, I was going to get the gloss black sideblades, but thought for the same price get it body matched for a sleeker look, but didn't realise it was plastic-looking, this does put it back on the table for debate, maybe I should go with the Gloss Black Package instead.Although the plan is to get this PPF'ed in a matte/satin PPF, to give the car a Satin white look to give it a touch of uniqueness so maybe it won't matter in that case.Roof bars, I also ticked, but wife says it looks like a truck now, and hates it. Prefers the sleek look without, and I'm kind of indifferent so decided to go without.I did think some of the stuff makes it a bit sporty, but the final consensus was to keep this looking like a luxury suv/crossover, and just get a proper sporty car later instead (where we will be doing something more out there like python green or racing yellow, and do all the go-faster bits on that one and keep this one more of a SUV). I kind of agree with that actually, and I guess that's also the missus hinting at approval to get a 911?Or so I hope.I did initially spec this is white with red interior, again missus hates the red (understandable as all red interior could be quite marmite) but loves the pebble grey, so white on white it is.......(not sure who's car this is becoming now, but then again if a 911 is on the cards in the future, then I don't mind it being so).Sunroof, I just heard of maintenance issues and leak issues, so I thought best to avoid the headache down the line.The smoking pack I avoided it because when selling one day, I didn't want it to look like I have been smoking inside the car when we don't even smoke. But good advice regarding somewhere to keep the keys, might take a look at this again.The demo car I test drove had BOSE and I must admit I was quite disappointed with the quality, maybe it hasn't been broken it yet. But I felt it was worse than the Harman Kardon in both my X5 and my wife's Mini, so I thought I should just go either standard or maybe go for the Burmester, and just decided I would go standard.Acoustic glass, I genuinely thought about this and do want the temperature element of it, but wanted to preserve the sports exhaust system sounds from the v6 engine. does yours dampen this sound?75L was a must for me too, and it is standard on the GTS.To be honest I didn't compromise on the GTS, and has all the stuff I spec'ed on the S as this will be a long termer.I just didn't really see anything else I wanted added on other than things that seemed a bit excessive like the carbon fibre wheels and gear lever","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Thanks Plyphone for your thoughts, love it.I actually selected the 14 way seat over the 18 way specifically as I had the 14 way in my test drive and found it comfortable.And after hearing that 18 ways are a bit more difficult to get in and out, and could also be uncomfortable for some, thought I would just go with 14, although I do find the look of 18 way does look nicer. Price is only like £200 difference so it wasn't the main consideration for the decision.As for 14 way over 8 way, I wanted the seat ventilation and for that you can't get it on the 8 way.And resale, not really a concern (evident from the fact I was even considering python green), the only thing I considered about resale is if adding the smoker package as a non-smoker would give the wrong impression to buyers","June 19, 2023"
wab172uk,"I wouldn't say the 18 way seats are harder to get out of. Especially if you have the seat setting for it to move back as you get out.But they are harder to get comfortable in. The demo car I had had the 14 way seats and they were comfortable from the off. When I collected my car I was getting back ache with my 18 way seats. But they just take a while to get the settings right. Think I had the side bolsters too tight. But now I'm very comfy and a 4 hour drive to Scotland and back the other week proved I'd got the setting just right.They do grip you more that's for sure. I'd not call them buckets, but certainly more sporty than the 14 way seats.The 18's look better to, but TBH if I'd ticked 14 way seats instead of 18, I'd have been perfectly happy. End of the day it's an SUV and not a 911.","June 19, 2023"

Jon A,Pebble belts are likely to get very grubby. How about Bordeaux belts to compliment the red calipers and GTS sticker and add a spot of colour to the inside?I have pebble btw and it looks phenomenal (in any colour car) and wears incredibly well.Re seats - 18w are as comfortable as any other BUT they absolutely are a pain not to sit on and crush the side bolsters every time in and out. This is a pita and creates unsightly creasing in the leather. You could be super careful and leaver yourself out every time but I don’t think that’s feasible long term…,"June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Oooooooooh I haven’t even considered that combination of Pebble seats with Red seatbelts.This is definitely one to run by the wifey and consider changing to once she gets home from the gym.14 vs 18 way has been the option I have been flipping between the most. I really can’t make up my mind.Price difference, yes of course I would like to save money but it’s so negligible in the grand scheme of things it’s not the deciding factor.I still think 18 looks the bomb and it will be a pure aspheric decision. It’s the getting in and out, the risk of discomfort on long journeys that is what gives 14 way a skin in the game. I think even if just the seat base and the centre of the seat back design was the same it would be an easier decision. Extra side support no that fussed. All my previous hatchbacks, saloon style cars etc had sports seats, but X5 didn’t and I didn’t really notice too much difference.","June 19, 2023"
Jon A,"The comfort factor will be the same but getting in and out will not. I’ve experienced both and the creasing of the bolsters is almost as annoying as clambering over them. I think it’s because you need to go up and over, then down out the car so not too much issue in a low sports car.If you like the 18w though, go with it we are talking about first world problems here!","June 19, 2023"
PJV997,"Good e-mail to the OPC and congrats on the new GTS build slot.My new GTS is due for early Sep build and I have a meeting on Wednesday with my SE to finalise spec so only another 36 hours for me to mess around.So much of the spec is very personal and as you seem to be keeping the car for the long term, you need to choose what you want.  We’re also buying for the long term so as a general rule, if in doubt I will add to the spec rather than leave something out I think we’d like, albeit I have tried to set a notional limit on what we spend.On the 14 vs 18 ways, we have also specced ventilation but have 14 ways.  Our Gen 1 has 18 ways.  I find them a bit snug and the side bolster creasing is an issue.  But unless you are the exact same build as me, my opinion on seats is not relevant.Personally, I’m finding the combination of colour and some of the exterior items such as side blades, the gloss pack, door handles and wheels as the most difficult to decide on.  I really like the GT wheels and I’m leaning towards the standard side blades with the GT wheels in Satin Platinum and no other embellishments (except we have pano roof and roof bars).  Pebble interior is pretty much locked and we are thinking Gentian or Papaya as exterior colour.Ultimately I don’t think there is a wrong choice.  Good luck getting to the finishing line!","June 19, 2023"

MoonageMin,"Thank you for the kinds words, and looking at your build slot and lock in date, it sounds like our car might even be on the same boat back to Blighty. Maybe even the same build day.I did set a nominal limit and currently almost 6 grand under so budget isn’t too bad, and planning to spend that towards the satin Ppf and dash cam fitting.I did pretty much spec everything I want (to be fair going GTS kind of did most of the specs as standard that I wanted) but it’s these little touches, red model designation on the side blades, or black. 14 vs 18, gloss va Matte model designation on rear etc that’s the tough choices.","June 19, 2023"
Jon A,"Re PPF, I have front end done but wouldn’t have it again. The problem is that it will scar with any larger stones that hit (still only small stones) and once the film is scarred it will not “self repair” and you are left with protected paint but a noticeable tear or hole in the film which can only be rectified by taking the PPF off!Have come to the conclusion that touching up the paint is way cheaper than the PPF…","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,You have a habit of raising good pointsBut shouldn’t the PPF warranty cover that and replace?I was initially going to get it ceramic coated. Then realised you can get Satin PPF. So a unique paint job and paint protection all in one and then it started to make a bit more sense as the missus and I always fancied a Matte/Satin paint job.,"June 19, 2023"
Jon A,Warranty covers peeling and discolouration not impact scarring unfortunately.It’s also hideously expensive to get the whole car done maybe £7k?I felt ceramic was worth it as it comes up very shiny even now a year later. The other thing to consider when PPF the whole car is that insurance companies are unlikely to cover you for it in the event of even a minor ding. I think that point has been discussed on here not too long ago,"June 19, 2023"
Jon A,"If you have a build slot, try including a PTS colour (if they do a satin one) and see what they say, probably cheaper than full PPF but might delay build?","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"The OPC I am buying from quoted me £5k for the ppf, I thought that was quite reasonable.I might ask the independent that they are out sourcing to for a quote to see how much they would charge, but if similar, I might just get it down through OPC so I can collect it with it all done.If there is a price gap, might need to reconsider obviously.","June 19, 2023"
MoonageMin,"Thank you everyone for all your advice. I have taken everything on board and deliberately carefully over each advice and feedback.Please don’t be offended if your suggestion wasn’t reflected, I did opt for 18 way seats and took dipped mirrors off.This will be my final locked spec, with the addition of XPEL Stealth PPF added on top which doesn’t show in the configurator. (FYI Stealth is Matte/Satin PPF and my car will end up as a Satin pearlescent Carrara White as a result).PPF will also get a ceramic coating on top, including all windows, windscreens, alloys, and callipers.

I was convinced it was electronic software at fault but Porsche said it needed a new PDK box. New box was flown over from Germany ( cost £5k ) . When fitted the car would still not operate. They then did a full reinstall of all the software and car was then fully operational. Old box was sent back to Germany and found to be perfect.

Guy,"Greetings all and Happy New Year!  Just thought I'd check back in after a prolonged absence and following my return to Blightly (and sunny Shropshire!)  It's been a busy few months with the move from Bucharest - although the drive back was quite enjoyable.Anyway the reason for posting 'here' is that on the 1750 mile return journey I started to notice an extra couple of  small jolts from the transmission when pulling away from standstill.  These felt very 'mechanical' and happened just before and after the change from 1st to 2nd gear.  Easy to miss, but clear as mud once you are looking out for it!As luck would have it, I am now living just a ten minute drive from Porsche Wolverhampton (newish dealership less than two years' old), so I popped in there a few days ago and explained the problem.  Straight away they said 'transfer box' and today it was replaced under warranty.  My car (an SD) was first registered Sep 2015, and has done less than 13K miles, mostly motorway but with the occasional trip somewhere more exciting (seeviewtopic.php?f=23&t=4511&p=87726&hilit ... san#p87726)Porsche Wolverhampton were very impressive, hence I am very pleased to be so local.  I was well looked after by Avril, the Senior Service Advisor, and they leant me this for the last couple of days.  It was about -2 degrees when I collected it, and I almost lost the back-end when pulling out of the dealership!Great fun for a short period (despite the atrocious potholed roads), but my wife kept turning off the sports exhaust - fun sponge!To be honest I am quite pleased that the transfer box failed whilst still in warranty, although I now have the dilemma about whether to extend the warranty out for another 2 years from this summer.Anyway, my advice to others who suspect their transfer boxes are mis-behaiving is to get them looked at straight away.  The car felt instantly smoother, even as I first drove away from the dealership.","February 13, 2018"

One of the technicians did say that they have not yet had a reoccurrence of the fault on any cars that have had a transfer box replacement.@ Mark-Yorkshire - Yes the warranty extension is a difficult decision!

In my opinion a major part such as a Transfer Box should not fail after only 2.5 years and 19,000 miles. I spoke to Silverstone Porsche about an extended warranty on the box and they in turn spoke to Porsche GB who offered a 50/50 split on a years warranty extension so I pay £400 instead of £800.I don't want to pay for an extended warranty I want Porsche to guarantee the Transfer Box.What sort of warranties have other people been getting?","August 11, 2018"

Crazy diamond,No. I do about 5k miles a year and feel that a car serviced by the main-dealer with less than 20k on the clock should not have any major/ expensive failings. If I was doing 20k a year or more maybe.  I am sure I am in the minority but I believe you if you pay for a quality product it should last. I underwrite myself and have always been ok - matter of choice. The transfer box issue is different.

Guy,"I am not renewing my warranty to cover the transfer box.  The transfer box failure has simply served to remind me that these cars can be expensive to fix.

Question is was it a botched fix (new transfer box) or didn't they identify the problem correctly has moisture ingressed again? hey ho, back and forth to the dealer again. Time to get a new car but what do I replace it with?","January 29, 2019"
Paul,There is another thread somewhere confirming the part number of the new modified box as 95B341010AX - worth checking your warranty invoice....,"January 29, 2019"
Dartmoor,"Thanks good idea.Checked the invoice and part number is P95B341010AX, back to square 1.","January 29, 2019"
Guy,On the US forum someone is suggesting that the 'AX' may denote a transfer box that has been 'factory rebuilt' - ie not new.The thread is here:https://www.macanforum.com/forum/compla ... ent-2.html,"January 29, 2019"
Paul,"Quite possibly correct although I think it was confirmed in the other thread that the “A” was the modified bit and the “X” stood for exchange unit - ie the factory won’t supply the new box without the old one going back (standard practice for major units in my previous experience.)Whether or not the old cases are rebuilt / recycled is the unknown bit (but I doubt if it is cost-effective unless the case casting is identical, in which case it shouldn’t be an issue)","January 29, 2019"
happy days,"Yep, I agree with the above. Parts are often modified throughout the vehicle's life cycle. They start with a part number, then an A-suffix denotes the first modification, B the second and so on. X denotes an exchange so that the part can be returned to the manufacturer, recycled and rebuilt using updated components.","January 30, 2019"
Tom 2000,So does the X denote that particular part has been factory reconditioned or exchange is required? Not strictly the same thing.,"January 30, 2019"
happy days,"Exchange required. If no exchange is possible, the dealer gets charged a horrendous surcharge.","January 30, 2019"
Guy,That may be the case but I doubt it is the reason for the 'X'.Where's the logic in defining a 'new' part by what happened to the part it replaced?,"January 30, 2019"
Paul,"No logic Guy, just standard motor trade practice (and more of an accountancy thing)Most major units are ""exchange"" units; the ""X"" means there is a significant surcharge applied on the invoice to the price of the part when it is supplied, and only refunded when the old unit is subsequently returned.Again, I'm not sure what happens to the old units, whether or not they are refurbished, scrapped, recycled to ""other"" markets. I guess this is dependent on the nature of the unit, the manufacturer, the modification and the severity of damage.","January 30, 2019"
Guy,"Thanks Paul!  I suppose it makes sense to the accountants!Given that mine was replaced in Feb 18, I am not sure whether I should be willing it to fail again before my extended warranty expires in Aug 20!

Nuclear Nick,"If neither the OPC nor the car tells you to stop driving you can continue, and you'd be covered in the unlikely event something else happens. Normal driving will not cause consequential damage, just try to minimise reversing on full lock or using the car in low traction situations where full 4 wheel drive kicks in. Even so, any further damage is only going to occur in the transfer box, so rest easy.If symptoms significantly worsen, very unlikely in normal driving, get back to your OPC.","August 22, 2020"

The V8 burble is rather seductive I must say and the Defender does have an attraction that I found hard to resist once it was announced with that engine. It has huge capability off road, as you might expect, but on road it is also superb. The V8 is the only version to have Dynamic mode and it certainly changes all the parameters to make it quite a beast on Tarmac. Mine has been reliable so far, with only a couple of minor niggles which were easily fixed.I’ve just got home after doing a one day advanced off road course at the Land Rover Experience centre at Eastnoor. It was quite a step up from the basic course, with a little theory before tackling some really tough challenges. One steep climb took me three attempts with the instructor whipping it up through the gears manually while I was giving it full gas! This was in one of their cars of course. Some of the terrain this vehicle will conquer with the right techniques is unbelievable.Land Rover has gone all out on the technology in the Defender and I’m still learning all the features it has and how to use them.

Scooby_Doo,"I've had the Macan for about six weeks now and done about 1200 miles , so a few thoughts :-My original order for a new Macan ""T"" ( 2.0 litre) was White with 21"" alloys and a few other choice options. The ex demo Macan ""S"" I bought is Gentian Blue with 20"" alloys and £17k of options. Buying an ex-demo obviously gave me no choice on individual options but being “forced” to accept somebody else’s choices sometimes works in your favour.Colour- I still like a White Macan but the Gentian Blue with the aluminium highlights (and red calipers) looks great, a bit too bling for some, but the first comment I get from everybody is ,""I love the colour"" . My previous two cars have been white and never had a problem with light scratches and swirls and small chips have always been easy to repair. Gentian Blue shows every little mark and swirl but does look stunning after it’s been cleaned. Would I actually spec it as a colour – on balance I think I would.Seats– My “T” spec had the 18 way seats and the “S” has 14 way , the 14 way are just as comfortable as the 18 way but the 14’s are easier to live with on a daily basis.Extended Leather- On my original spec, looks and feels great , gives the car that extra bit of class (s/be standard) Contrast stitching would make it look even better but not worth an extra £2500Wheels- 21"" alloys were always at the top of my list but the 20"" double 5 spoke (polished) would be my choice of wheel in hindsight. They're easy to clean and I can actually clean the red calipers through the spokes. I cleaned my wife's Juke yesterday , 19"" multispoke , took bloody ages to clean them.Engine- in my heart I always wanted the 2.9 V6 , as a car with a Porsche badge should have an engine to match , but a new one was about £5k over my budget. After 1200 miles with the “S” I think I would have been slightly underwhelmed with the “T”, my previous C250d had 205hp and a useful 500Nm of torque, floor it above 2000rpm and it just flew.375 bhp and a 0-60 in 4.7 seconds puts a big grin on my face every time I press hard with my right foot , it's fast. It's also so comfortable and quiet thanks to the air suspension and thermally insulated glass, even my grandson has commented on how quiet the car is , even though he's glued to his iphone most of the time.MPG on a few 80 mile round trips has been about 31 mpg and 22mpg on the 8 mile school run, I only do about 7000 miles a year so can live those figures.Panoramic Roof( On my spec) - brightens up the interior no end and open is a lot less draughty than the one on my C Class - bigger wind deflector.Running boards- the general opinion was that they just got in the way when getting into the car so I decided not to spec them on the ""T"" , but very relieved that they're fitted to the ""S"". I have a sit on kayak and there was always a question mark over whether I could transport it on the Macan, but the boards are brilliant , loading and strapping it to the roof rack is a dawdle. I can also clean the roof easily.Other fitted options:-Towbar - probably never use it.Adaptive cruise - don't like it at all , cruise is fine but is sometimes overridden by the adaptive system PITA.Porsche crests on headrests -  I never notice them.Loadspace management system – useful on occasions but I wouldn’t spec it.Heated windscreen & steering wheel - car's always parked in the garage , might be handy on the odd occasion.Silver tailpipes – look nice but I think £606 could be better spent elsewhere.Illuminated sill plates – look nice.Silver “Macan “S”  on sideblades – on Gentian , definitely.Thermally insulated glass +privacy glass. – The car is very quiet unless I’m pressing on, and very glad that it’s fitted , would I spend over £1000 to spec it – ask me when I order another Macan.One thing I have noticed , not sure if it’s because of the insulated glass, but the tint on the rear windows isn’t very dark, not a complaint, I have pretty grandchildren, but my neighbours new GLE’s tint is virtually opaque.Things I don't like - having had column shift Mercedes autos for the past ten years I'm finding it hard to adapt to a centre console shift that doesn't automatically set or release the handbrake . The useless speedometer, although I'm now used to looking at the digital speedo under the rev counter , easier to read actually.Things I really really like - The car , the engine , the ride - everything apart from the gearshift.Still can't get over the fact that I got the ""S"" for slightly less than the cost of a new ""T"" and didn’t have to wait 12 months for delivery.Main omission – no spare wheel","June 14, 2023"

petew0557,"Whilst on  my PEC experience I learned that you don't need to manually release the electronic handbrake, you just drive away, works well plus the hold function on a hill is really useful.Gentian Blue in this sunny weather really looks the part.My only criticism regarding the paintwork is that the paint in comparison to other makes of cars I've had, seems 'soft' and scratches easily.ACC comes into its own on busy, nose to tail motorway driving.Surround view, especially TOP view is brilliant and helps my crap parking manoeuvring in todays tight spaces.","June 15, 2023"
wab172uk,"Nice review. Yes Gentian Blue with silver roof bars, windows and tail pipes look great. I would say that though !!!!One option I wish I'd ticked was the thermally insulated glass. I had it on my X3 but didn't think it would be much different without. I was wrong. On a hot day, you can feel the heat coming through the windows, while on the X3 you didn't. Kicking myself over that one.18 way seats. I thought I'd F**ked up at first as I just couldn't get comfy and my back was aching even after just 30 min of driving. But now I've played about with them, I've found my comfy setting. I think slackening off the side bolsters helps a lot. For me, I do think the 14 way seats are probably the better day to day option, but I do love how the 18 way seats feel far more sporty and supportive. Pleased I bought them.","June 15, 2023"
EngineerMK,"I've had my S for 5 weeks now... the overall spec is close yours, also Gentian Blue with chrome highlights.  1500miles in I agree with most of your comments. I love the ACC and wouldn't buy a car with out it, I've had it on previous cars, and use it on every trip.  The loadspace management system is used on every supermarket shopping trip to stop the groceries flying everywhere, a loose tin of white emulsion in a Mk 1 Golf taught me the importance of securing loads, it took a long time clean up!  I have acoustically/thermally insulated glass (but not with privacy glass), it is slightly darker than standard glass, maybe thats why your privacy glass doesn't look dark as there is less of a contrast to standard glass.","June 15, 2023"

kogs,I have had the front Porsche Dashcam installed in Sept 2022 on my 22 Macan S.  Recently - last few weeks - it has been falling off the windscreen mount.  I have been really unlucky recently- my car was scuffed by another vehicle on the bumper while parked.  The other driver drove off without stopping (surprise !). When I returned to the car I found that this was one occasion where the dashcam had already fallen off and it recorded nothing.Not sure if the problem is related to the recent warm weather or something else and if anyone has had the same experience of it falling off the windshield mount?,"June 14, 2023"
Skyway,When you say falling off the mount do you mean the sticky pad becoming detached from the wind screen or the camera becoming unclipped from the mount?Too date I haven’t experienced anything like this with mine.,"June 14, 2023"

kalniel,"I haven't seen a lot about this, but does anyone else notice this on their RHD Macans? I just had a test drive of the Macan S and as a result of the transmission bump on the offside there seems to be much less resting foot room and the pedals are slightly offset to the right. Test drive wasn't very long so no discomfort, but has anyone found it an issue?I also couldn't read the speedometer! Thankfully the digital display is all that's needed, but otherwise I found it really hard to try judging where 30 and 60mph were on the analogue dial.(don't worry, overwhelming impression was positive - that engine can forgive a lot of faults!)","April 02, 2023"
AllanG,"Yep, the gear case intrusion into the drivers footwell does take some time to get used to, but still I find on a long run that I have to move my left leg more often to prevent discomfort.I think we all agree that the analogue speedo is a waste of time, but this harks back to many years of Porsche tradition, whereby the rev counter takes central position.Pleased that you liked the rest of your test drive, and I agree the S engine is great!!","April 02, 2023"
Plyphon,"Also found the position of my left foot odd - I was after a bit more of a platform there.

On-Track,"Hi Neil. If what you wrote is correct and you last 3x longer before you need to take a break then your dodgy right leg, old age and decrepitude are probably helping more than the Macan's pedal layout.I don't accept that the analogue speedo is 100% useless as some posters have said as it shows the speed accurately.

TheTraveller,"I agree about the analogue speedo, but the digital is far more accurate to read than the other. The thickness of the needle on the analogue, could be a difference of 2 to 3 mph, depending how it's read.There is a name is physics, which TBH eludes me, which shows that the speed read by the passenger in a vehicle, will be different to what the driver sees.And depending on where seated when reading it, the speed will be different too.","April 03, 2023"

Residual values on GTS are still strong which doesn't help when using my man maths formula as my car will be less than 2 years old should I press the go button. Big fly in the ointment however is that the current price of my car new is around £82k; £4k more than I paid. So man maths applied a new car will cost my car plus around £10-12k for a Brand new 2024 GTS.

I had to jog the SE’s memory that I would be out of the country and this did not suit. So yes the delivery time has reduced significantly, I suspect due to cancellations after the price increase. When I said I needed to keep to the March 24 date I got the following email….” I do want to mention that with the launch of Macan EV due in 2024, we're not entirely sure what that will mean for the combustion engine. We don't know what part of the year it is due to launch, or if they will possibly run the two models alongside each other for a while. It's just to make you aware that there could be implications to the availability of this model. However, as I say, we haven't had any communication to indicate that this would be the case. I'd rather mention it and make you aware, than have it pop up at a later date…..This was probably an attempt to get me to take the Aug delivery. I did think about going for it but decided against.

aj13,"When i purchased car the wheels had just been diamond cut but i noticed a few blemishes i wasnt happy with.So i asked to get them redone only to be told they were at their limit (3 times???) for diamond cutting.Now I am not a fan of diamond cut alloys in general (look good new, but tarnish very quickly), so it gave me an excuse to get wheels redone in a color to suit car.But what color??Eventually settled on what i think is called smoked chrome. Sides of spokes are darker than alloy face. Also got some new centers which are body coloured.I'm happy with how they turned out, really pleased with service of wheels people too.

wab172uk,"Well, after picking up the new Macan S last week, I decided to take the day off and go for a drive around to start running it in.Frustrating day, as the 30-40mph club was out in force meaning nothing over 2000 revs for most of the day.The seats. I went for the 18 ways seats. And although the seats feel more supporting that the 14 way seat I test drove, meaning they grip you tight feeling more bucket like, they did feel quite hard on my back. Few times my back ached, but that could be down to not having the right seating position yet. I have to say the driving position on my old X3 was superior in position to steering wheel / peddles. I'm still fiddling with the seat, but I do wish the steering column came out further than it does. Not much in the way of reach. Another inch would make getting a far better driving position.The peddles are taking some getting used to. Not sure why the brake peddle has to be further out than the throttle peddle. What feels great for one, is not right for the other. As I've seen this mostly in Audi's, I assume it's just because the Macan & Q5 are based on the same plantform. But surely this is an easy thing for Porsche to fix?Loving the overall look and feel of the interior. Feels a classy place to be. Though as with all modern cars, the infotainment system is frustrating in having to take your eyes off the road to prod the screen. But everything works well, nicely laid out. Will take some getting used to from BMW's I-Drive system.Burmester. It definitely sounds better than the BOSE system that was in the demo car I recently had for a few days. You can feel the difference in quality, especially in the base, and clarity of sound. Worth the £3500? Questionable, but I'm pleased I ticked it.Ride and handling. I think this is the biggest difference over say the X3 M40i. Once I did get on some open roads I know well, the ride quality over pretty poor roads was exceptional. Where in my GR-Yaris you wince over certain pot-marked surfaces, the Macan just flows over them. I guess that's the advantage of air suspension. I really was impressed.The other thing that impressed was the handling. For those who know the North. I went from Penrith to Alston to Middleton-in-Teesdale. A great twisty fast road. It really does feel unlike any other SUV I'd driven (again maybe air suspension) to the point the point where I found myself driving it like a Hot Hatch. Only when you catch a bump in corner at near 3 figures, are you reminded you're in a 1.8 tonne SUV. But very impressive for what it is.The engine. OK, I was taking it easy, but you can feel the power of that 2.9l V6. Overtaking was very easy without the need to rev it out. Kept below 4500 revs max for the first 500 miles. Wil then stretch it out between 500-1000 miles before full beans after that. Lots of low down torque to call upon. Think I'm going to like this engine.The brakes. Again, taking it easy, but maybe got carried away on the Penrith road. But they felt very strong without needing to lean on them too much. Feel far superior to those on the X3 which I always felt didn't like being pressed hard too often. One thing I've noticed is the amount of brake dust. Even on our first 50 mile drive out when we first picked it up. The wheels were covered in brake dust. I cleaned them before my day out, and the black left on both the sponge and my hands was quite shocking. Sponge still black, and it took a few washes to get my hands clean. Has anyone else found this?Hope the above wasn't too boring. But just thought I'd share my views. So much more of a car than I thought I'd be getting when I decided to look at the Macan 15 months ago.","June 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,"Great review.Getting the seat positioned does take time, it is a while since I drove an X3 Beamer and a major drawback to the X3 was the poor lumber support and lack of vertical movement in the lumber pad.  So do persevere you will get there, and do save the memory setting, initially I used them all to set different configurations.  Now I never have to change them.I am not a fan of the 18 way, yes it does hold you firm and for me that resulted in back ache as there is no squirm room on long trips.Great road btw, used to ride over it frequently on the motorbikes.As for brake dust, that should lessen as the pads bed in but then a cleaning product like Getechniq’s Fall Out remover and a pressure washer will remove the vast majority of the brake dust.A sponge?  Mine were consigned to the bin years ago, do read the washing and cleaning your Macan thread or Google two bucket car cleaning.","June 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"Yeah, I do always use the 2 bucket method when washing my cars. It was more a quick wipe down as I needed to take some photo's for the wheel & Tyre insurance I took out.I'm hoping the back ache does ease once either the seats are worn in a bit, or maybe I just need to slacked off the side bolsters.I will look at proper alloy cleaners, and I must look at foam sprays too. I'll check out the washing and cleaning thread.","June 01, 2023"
Neil1911,"You obviously won't have missed the steering wheel mounted controls, however, you may not have yet met the Voice Control.... ""Play BBC Radio Four"", ""Play Dire Straights"" etc. or for Satnav, ""Drive me to Tracky"".

wab172uk,"I have my music on SD cards too.I need to book in for the 2nd handover, as I'm sure this might help me understand what is available through the steering wheel, and what's not. It's all just a bit new as I'm used to I-Drive.","June 01, 2023"

Col Lamb,"Do take note that to get a good foam that actually sticks requires a decent foam lance and a high pressure sprayer ideally over 150bar, eg one of the B&Q sold Karcher units at c£99 is only 110 bar and will give a weak foam.As my Macan has a Gtechniq ceramic coating I use their products which I buy from Ultimate Finish.No, I do not earn commission.","June 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"That's good to know, thanks.","June 01, 2023"
wab172uk,"I think they have a standard running in for the entire world, where obviously there are different fuels, conditions etc.There was a very good article I read years ago on Audisport that was written by an Audi engineer. Basically he wrote that loading the engine through different rev ranges while running in actually helped run the engine in. Sticking to low revs and constant revs wasn't very good for the engine. He advised the stages which I wrote earlier. First few hundred, load up but keep to about 4000-4500 revs, then between 500-1000 miles load up higher in the rev range. Just keep away from the red line.Right or wrong, who knows? But it came from an engineer rather that out of a handbook or salesman. I don't think it's done any of my cars any harm, and they've all pulled very well once a few thousand miles are on the clock.I think engines are far different from years ago where low rev running in was maybe more advisable.","June 01, 2023"
EngineerMK,"Some interesting thoughts.  I recently took delivery of a Macan S, it replaced a 2017 340i touring.  I rejected buying a X3 M40i because of the poor ride quality so your comments have reassured me I made the right choice.  I too miss the Beemers I-Drive, so much easier than a touch screen (and no finger prints).  I also have 18ways seats and have found them spot on from day one (but I also have 18ways in my Cayman S).  Like you I'm just starting to enjoy the engine more now I've passed 1000miles, a great sound track and very accessible low down torque.  The interior quality is excellent, on a pr with the Aston Martins and Bentley I played with at work before I retired.My annoyances to date; the phone heater (aka charger), inability for the App to stay paired to the car and some annoying rear window distortions.","June 01, 2023"
EngineerMK,"I'd agree with those comments.  I used to test prototype engines on dynos (test beds).  We'd run them in over a variety of speeds and loads, gently increasing the speeds and over a set program, then after ten hours run a power curve (which typically takes 30-60mins when parameters are hand controlled), then repeat after another another ten hours running.  when two consecutive power curves matched the engine was considered to be run-in, this was usually after 40-50 hours.  This was true for Rover K Series engines at the start of my career and supercar engines I was testing just before I retired.","June 01, 2023"
Scooby_Doo,"Re cleaning your wheels - buy a box of disposable gloves, got fed up years ago trying to get brake dust off my hands. I've had polished finish alloys on various MB cars for years and my Macan has the standard 20"" polished wheels . All I've ever used to clean them is whatever's left in the wash bucket and a Halfords bug shifter sponge and never had any signs of lacquer peel or oxidisation. One of the first jobs I had to do on my ex demo Macan was remove the centre caps and polish off the oxidisation that had started to appear on the edges probably as a result of the ""nice"" wheel cleaner the OPC used.","June 01, 2023"
BZR81,"I think the Macan is similar to my current Cayman in that one of the physical knobs below the infotainment screen puts an outline round the icons and can be used to scroll through them and pushed to select. Similar to how the big dial works on iDrive. You might have already figured that out, but I use it a bit as I find it easier than trying to jab the screen.","June 01, 2023"
Nuclear Nick,"Thanks for posting this, it’s good to hear from someone with knowledge and real world relevant experience. We’ve done this subject to death so many times over the years and we always get the same old nonsense about ‘the salesman said it’s already run in at the factory’, or ‘modern engines don’t need running in now’, or ’I’ve never run mine in and they’ve always been fine’.

On-Track,"Two key differences: The GTS suspension is a much sportier suspension and has the latest instrumentation.If you prefer buttons on the centre console, the ability to manually control the gearbox with the transmission lever (as well as with paddles) as well as a nice leather gaiter on the transmission lever then the Mk2 is for you.

dj_120,"Hi guys, I’ve read many a post on this forum whilst waiting for my 2nd Macan. Thank you to everyone who contributed I passively picked up so much info.I figured it’s only fair to return the favour and pop some experience on the new one vs the old.Old was a 2019 Gen 2 Macan SNew is a 2023 Gen 3 Macan GTSPrior to the Macans I had a 718 Cayman S (my first Porsche), but limited parking and babies arriving, I needed to consider a change. This is the first time I’ve ordered the “same” car twice.My 2019 Macan S was a fantastic car and anyone lucky enough to have one is in for a cracking ride. My car was very lightly spec’d with PASM, 18-way seats (to get full leather seats at the lower cost option),roof bars, tinted glass, 19” wheels and that was pretty much it. I felt the car had everything I needed and more. It felt luxurious and drove really well.Coming from a manual cayman, I was initially a little under-whelmed on the drive home. I initially felt a lack of excitement and engagement, wondering if I made the right choice. Although, cornering was impressive, right from the off. However, I was soon to be proven wrong about the lack of engagement, after spending my entire Silverstone Porsche Experience (my 3rd time) playing and understanding quirks with the PDK. The pros instantly understood my lack of excitement expecting the box to just plant-and-go. In a nut-shell, I came away understanding just how brilliant that box can be and how it can be so much more responsive. My takeaway: Kick down and knock it into manual to hold the gear, ready for instant response a good few seconds before an overtake. Another: Quick stab again when wanting instant engine breaking a couple of gears, without flapping the downshift flap. Coming into corners, or even casually slowing for a roundabout was brilliant and not all on the brakes. Sorry if teaching to suck eggs…It wasn’t something I knew to get more out of the PDK.The Porsche Experience pros were brilliant. I came away thinking the PDK has a six-sense. Pretty clever. Previously, I could obviously dictate exactly what I wanted with a manual.However, despite the brilliance, too many times I felt like I wanted more out of the car. It’s still really really great, I’m talking just about being a tad greedy in performance - the power would run out from time to time as it went through the rev range. I don’t live near a motorway, so all my driving is on A/B roads with lots of bends, that can be accelerated out of, and rarely do I take it on longer motorway journeys. Things like lane departure / cruise control was permanently off and not used. But, I knew it was a brilliant car, just in the odd occasion you could stretch its leg, it was a little lacking. Something I shared with a number of owners locally.I ordered the GTS un-tested, but obsessed over the wonderful reviews from pretty much every journalist. The closest dealer is 120 miles from me. However, felt it was a low risk due to the resale value. Ordered in late 2021 for 2023 delivery. The car is heavily loaded just in its standard guise I feel, especially compared to my last car, but I did spec the Panoramic roof (which I do actually love despite not thinking I would) and Race-Tex headlining. I love the luxury boost the race-tex provides on the roof along with the leather. Appreciate it’s not for everyone. I have a similar spec exterior to the S - intentional (Volcanic Grey / privacy glass for the kids). I dropped the roof bars for the GTS as my “dreams” of loading it up with a ski box and heading to the mountains didn’t materialise like the Porsche marketing posters. The change to me was mainly for the increased performance - it also passes-by fairly unnoticed that I’ve swapped.My goodness though for drivers and passengers alike, it’s a different beast altogether. The power delivery through the rev range just keeps on giving, where the S felt like it gave up or you were hoping for a bit more, the GTS is sheer wonderful on that front. Maybe the GTS probably has too much performance for the road - as you do run out of track, I mean road, quickly.But it’s a real thrill. I’ve always had at least PASM on my p-cars as I did drive a courtesy one without and found myself bouncing down the road. But I’m not sure I fully notice much difference with the air suspension compared to PASM on daily drives in Comfort mode. Both are lovely and smooth. Sport+ thought is pretty brutal.It’s mind-bogglingly clever these cars - imagine it’s the same with all of the Macan variants. I tried the base 2.0 but not the newer T. Every time you exit a corner, you can’t help but think “humans are pretty incredible”, in the same way they made rocket-boosters land vertically back onto a launch pad. That novelty doesn’t wear off. Both Macans made my older, yet brilliant, BMW M135i, ironically feel like a top-heavy, sporty postal-van. The GTS has obviously more power to play with. The S had Michelins Pilot Sport and they were incredible, really good, and in the wet too. The P-Zeros I’ve had over the years are great in the dry but that’s about it. The GTS fires the traction control in the wet without really trying. I guess I am trying to be picky throughout: I did prefer the manual push of the gear selector to the side in the older S (one of the Porsche Experience recommended ideas), which is swapped for a mini “m” button on the steering wheel. Holding a gear is often replaced with me switching to the next radio station instead. As for the Haptic Touch vs the obvious & easy-access buttons - the jury is out.As for the Sport Chrono sport response / “push to over-take”, I find this a waste of time. I think not having it previously, meant I was getting the car into a similar sense, with the manual hold in preparation for an expected launch. Carrying this technique over to the GTS, I don’t see a huge difference and arguably it’s more fun doing it yourself.I have seat protectors for the children’s car seats which work really well but without the children I’d probably go for full extended leather…Hey…I’d probably even go for the pebble grey interior without kids. With the upgraded, but standard speakers in the GTS, Peppa Pig and Spiderman soundtracks sound just fine indeed! But the interior had lots of compliments from passengers, even in the lightly spec’d S. Of course, the GTS has those extra touches I didn’t have previously. It’s a lovely place to be. It’s right up there with the very best cars I’ve ever sat in, costing many times more. I rarely have adults in the back but on the short journeys they seem to be impressed too - stroking the roof lining far too often!Quick tangent, it’s worth pointing out about re-sale. There’s a lot of comments about buying the car for yourself and not re-sale, I definitely understand this, however I’ve been a cautious buyer needing to balance both. Being lightly spec’d, it was a lower cost option and also, as expected, sold for the lower end of the market. Which, still returned me a whopping 78% after nearly 4 years of what I paid for the car - it sold within 2 weeks of being advertised. This car (and the cayman in fact too) worked out less money than a sporty m-lite 1-series BMW, worth nearly 1/2 the price new. As such, it is a sensible buy with re-sale in mind. The most ridiculous comment I can make, when choosing a Macan, is that “it’s a cheap car”, although is probably one of its closest truths - without wanting to sound ostentatious, but strong re-sales gave me the previously unthought opportunity to dip into Porsche and I’ve not looked back.All in all, the S was great. Really liked it, but too many times I felt underwhelmed after coming from the Cayman S. It’s not a major criticism of the Macan S, I drove away without much excitement, maybe I was conscious I was wearing it in, and not pushing it just yet. It simply didn’t wow me like the Cayman or Gen3 GTS did when I first drove it. I had to keep reminding myself this is what a family-mobile must be like.That thought was short-lived with the GTS. I’ve personally not tried the upgraded Gen 3 S, but I bet that is blooming great to be honest. I’ve said more than once lately, I do think this GTS is as close to perfection for a one-car trick. The slightly added ride height to help with my elderly relatives get in and out comfortably, throwing the kids in the back, loads of luggage space for them and then exciting alone time for me too. It’s brilliant. I can’t help but think my next car needs to come with a new-house / house-redesign with more driveway! Maybe then a 2 car option could surpass this 1-car experience.If only the official after-sales experience was remotely adequate then the whole experience would be brilliant. Ignore that bit, as it’s worth it for the car from a cracking brand.Thanks for the posts from all contributors - it really helped me obtain some different perspectives.","June 01, 2023"

wab172uk,"Good post.I too feel the Macan (with air suspension) certainly drives far better than it really should do, especially for something north of 1.8 Tonnes. I made a post earlier this week saying just that. I was driving it like a Hot Hatch, and that was just when taking it gentle while running it in. It's amazing how they can get these big heavy cars to handle so well.As for the PDK. I was hoping the gear stick could have been moved to the side and had the ability to be pushed back and forth to change gear. I think that would have brought an extra layer to the interaction with the car. Maybe Porsche felt most owners wouldn't use it? I know I would have.","June 03, 2023"

Plyphon,Seems like a more aggressive throttle map and possibly a bit more peak BHP up high in the rev range (which is known in the 2.9) which translates to a small but noticeable performance increase if/when you get up there. Handling is more 'sporty' being stiffer and whatnot.,"June 05, 2023"
FirstSeaLord,"Agree re similar performance, esp real worldAm guessing wildly but sensible / low specced GTS likely to hold value better than heavily specced S I think","June 05, 2023"
pmg,I suspect an S with air and sports chrono has a wider range of usable suspension settings for UK roads than a GTS.

Jon A,"Definitely better residuals on GTS. I have heavily specced S and will have lost value significantly more I think.I couldn’t wait the 18 months for GTS at the time and knew it would be a keeper, so specced up to look nice and still loving itThat was three price rises ago though, mine cost me £70k but would be £78.5k today and only 12 months old!","June 05, 2023"

Life is too important not too look after your own or others.Sorry for the moral message, life been a bit tough last six weeks and why I havent posted much, my Father in law was two weeks short of his 83rd birthday, went out for his usual morning coffee near where he stayed and while crossing at a set of pedestrain lights a Taxi driver wiped him out and was D.O.A at A & E. My wife and Mother in Law as you can imagine beyond grief, one of those phone calls and Traffic Police at our door to tell us the news.For all on the Forum, please enjoy life and those family and people around us, we never know what lies ahead. We have a Police liason officer that calls us every day to keep us informed as Fiscal service will have full accident report to send us on with regards any formal prosecutions.Sorry for hijacking this thread, but Nicks message and point really struck a point with me, and not clearing that snow could have impact on you or someone else.Enjoy your weekend Fellow Forum members, I will be back with my usual quips and fuel comments as usual, just been a bit tough lately.Cheers GTB","June 02, 2023"

GTB,"Thanks very much all for your thoughts and kind words.All been so unreal and still cant believe it, Father in Law just doing what he did most days, went out for a coffee, and as a pedestrian crossing between the studs on a pedestrian crossing and taxi wiped him out. Its all been caught on CCTV and plenty of eye witnesses, but full report wont be sent to us for another couple of months. Been a lot on social media as surprise suprise lights had been out of action for nearly a month, so local authority involved as to why they hadnt been repaired, there is a T junction within 10M of the crossing and a taxi rank on that street but its a no right turn at that junction but often taxis ignore and other cars ignore that sign, so not sure if taxi made an illegal turn, and because its so close to the crossing might explain things. Anyway as liason officer has said my wife and mother in law can torture themselves for ever over all the what if's.My wife just cant get over the brutality of it as she says, her Dad lived a couple of weeks short of his 83rd birthday and a fit guy, walks out the house to do something he did most days and never came home!

cinders,"Hi Guys,Sorry for the long post, but I'd love your opinion on this.  I know it's a great decision to have to make, but I agonize thinking over this.  I know, it's first world problems...A few years ago, upon returning to the UK, I bought a 2020 Macan S and I loved it.  It was the most amazing car I'd ever driven in terms of luxury (for me anyway...) it was a dream to drive, and it was fairly quick.  I was using it as a daily, however I was horrified at the fuel consumption - It averaged around 18mpg - which I just couldn't justify in my head for a suv to run my kid to school, etc.My other dream car was a 911.  So I traded the Macan in and ended up with a 991.2 C4 GTS which I absolutely loved and even better, I could average 25mpg.  It was great on fuel if driven sensibly, and I could also take it for amazing drives on the country lanes.  Now, I know you'll say I shouldn't be worrying about fuel economy with these cars, I just do it's my OCDAnyway, with the 911 I was always worried about where I could park it at times in case someone keyed it, damaged it, etc as it was quite a stand-out car.   So....  I bought a diesel macan as a second car, which was great.  I got good fuel economy from it, I wasn't worried about leaving it anywhere, and it was nice.In the end, I sold up and moved away and got rid of the cars.   But, now I'm moving back and would love to have a nice car again.  I really like the 992 and I really like the new Macan GTS.  But I think if I buy a 992, then I might be worried about taking and leaving it places, so I'd end up buying a diesel macan again as a second car.However, then there would be two cars to service, tax, insure, etc.  So I'm thinking, do I just get the Macan GTS and then I only have one car to worry about.  It looks great, it's fast and fun to drive.... and it's quiet inside.  One major issue I had with my 911 was the road noise inside, it was incredibly loud.  I recently saw a Harry's garage YouTube review of the 992, and he noticed and was annoyed by the same thing.  So that's a downside for the 992.Any suggestions/opinions would really be great.","May 30, 2023"
PJV997,"I think the first question is whether the 992 is sufficiently practical as a sole car now and for the foreseeable future if there is no other car in the household.If no, then the answer is straightforward.  If yes, then the other factors you mention come into play and ultimately only you can decide what is right for your circumstances.From a personal perspective, we are consolidating three cars into two.  We were finding that one car in particular was getting used less and less and so for us a Macan GTS is going to become our everyday car, replacing the job of two current cars.  I am confident its breadth of ability will make it a great car for an engaging Sunday blast, a mega road trip through Europe or simply pottering around doing regular chores.","May 30, 2023"
Skyway,"Around town 18mpg is probably the going rate, but it's better to look at the average.  Mine averages at around 25mpg.Having said that I'm not sure you buy a Porsche for great full economy.  Perhaps wait for the Macan EV?","May 30, 2023"
Wing Commander,"Agree with above that the practicality of a 911 for you & your family will be the first consideration, but that doesn’t seem to appear as a factor in your post above.I know what you mean about worrying where you park a 911, as I’ve run a 991.2 T as a daily driver/sole car for over 5 years, and I do still sometimes worry about where I park it.  But, hey - we only live once, right?!Also, there’s no guarantee that a Macan wouldn’t attract the wrong kind of attention.I hazard a guess that my T is louder than any 992 you’d buy, as mine had reduced sound deadening, plus my mods have made the exhaust louder.  And I happily live with mine.Would you be looking at a used or new 992?  Any thoughts on which model?Cheers,","May 30, 2023"
cinders,"Hey Guys,Thanks for the replies, it's really appreciated.I'm lucky as my son is now 8 and a few years ago he easily fitted (even in a child seat) in the back of the 911.  He'll be fine in the back of a 911 for a good few more years.The 911 was a perfect everyday car, we had no issues at all.  I guess luggage space wasn't that good and the road noise was pretty bad, but apart from that it was fine.With regard to the MPG - I'm old now at 40 and don't race everywhere I go.  I drive quite sensibly but enjoy a good old blast here and there, or sometimes if I'm alone, and it's a nice country road on a nice day, then I'll give it some beans and blow a ton of fuel.   During the lockdown, I'd throw a loaf of bread in a plastic bag (to say I'd been shopping) in the boot and spend half a day blasting around the North Yorkshire moors.  Amazing fun.I'd look to buy a second hand 992 Carrera 4S.   I'd never buy a car without 4WD as there's a few times when I've had near miss, where I believe the 4WD saved my life (I had a car blindly pull in to my fast lane when I was doing 95mph once, and I had to make a hard manoeuvre - I swear if the car was rear-wheel drive I would have been done for)Thanks again!","May 30, 2023"
CamGTS,both,"May 30, 2023"
wab172uk,"Two completely different cars, and at completely different price points.I bought a Macan S, as it serves it's purpose. To take us around the UK for days out walking and Holidays. A 911 just wouldn't be practical enough, no matter how hard I tried to justify it with roof boxes etc. Plus, the 911 is a car I just wouldn't be happy taking down narrow single track roads over the Lakes. Tried it years ago in my old MK1 R8, and it was scary, and never repeated.If we always holidayed abroad and didn't drive down narrow roads, I would have go myself a 911. But then again, the price difference is huge. The 911 I would order would be a GTS. Either C2 with light weight pack (mini GT3 Touring), or C4 with 18 way seats (mini Turbo). But your looking at £130,000+ compared to £80k+ for a Macan GTS.At the end of the day, only you can decide what car suits your lifestyle best.The only negative with the 911 is the stupidly long gearing. To thrash it on UK roads, you'd never get out of 3rd gear. and to red line it in 3rd, your doing over 110mph. I'm not sure I wouldn't get frustrated about that.","May 30, 2023"

cinders,"Yeah, you reminded me of a near accident on a single country lane, I always drive to the conditions of the road and was going very slowly when a car came flying around a blind corner, he hadn't seen me because the 911 is quite low down and the hedgerow was high, he had to swerve on to the grass verge and ended up in a field to avoid me.  I got out of the car and went running over but he sped off.  I was ready to kill him.  What an absolute idiot.","May 30, 2023"
Plyphon,"I recently went down to the West Country on a driving trip with some pals - some of the roads there are incredible. There are times I wished I was in a 911. But then we also got quite rural quite quickly, and the Macan GTS was the perfect car to have on those roads. There were some roads my mate in his lowered M4 simply couldn't drive down.Overall, the Macan GTS came alive the entire weekend and was nothing but a joy to drive, and it meant I could go where the others couldn't without worrying if I was going to break my front splitter or under tray.So , if it's a one car garage, I'd say it depends on what driving you're likely to do and what roads you're likely to end up on!","May 30, 2023"

Ntense,"I fully understand where you re coming from; whilst waiting for my Gen 3  Macan S I took an extended drive in a 992 Carerra, I wish I hadn't. The 992 was all it was hyped to be and a car I could love, now the Macan S in my case is a great vehicle but I have come to realise that I cannot love an SUV, it lacks the emotion and connection the 992 delivers, yes it has road noise, is a lot less practical and can you really use that power anywhere on public roads? but it took my breath away and is they type of car I would take out just for the hell of it which I don't do with the Macan S. The GTS may be very different. My head says stay with the Macan, it's quieter, practical, more than quick enough but compared to the 992, I find it lacking in soul, that said it is an unfair comparison one is a proper sports car the other a sports SUV and there is a big difference. However, I know some people use a 911 as a daily, I just couldn't for some of the reasons posted earlier so a second daily would be ideal. My advice is to take an extended drive in the GTS, it may work for you as it is a great vehicle.

Jon A,I think the contract terms are quite clear in as much as you are entitled to deposit back if cancellation before lockdown?They could have simply cancelled the order at their end but I suspect they didn’t read your mail until too late??Either way I think you could make a big deal of this so push for £3k (if you want the car) or stick to your guns and demand your deposit back.Sounds like an OPC cock-up…,"May 29, 2023"

Devonian,"Unfortunateley, I had to have a new windscreen fitted last Friday (stone chip and crack). I've now noticed wind noise when I get up to about 45 -50 mph and above, now I'm not saying the noise wasn't there before, and maybe having the new windscreen has focused my attention to the noise....but I'm 90% sure it wasn't as bad as it is now.Has anyone else notice wind noise at that that speed?","March 15, 2016"
adrian991,Your wind noise suggests that either the new windscreen is faulty or it has not been fitted correctly or both. You should not be getting any wind noise at that speed.Was it a proper Porsche OEM windscreen fitted at a Porsche Centre or a third party product fitted by one of the windscreen companies?,"March 15, 2016"
Devonian,"I'm assuming it was a Porsche windscreen but was fitted by 3rd party, insurance job.","March 15, 2016"
adrian991,"Well it could be a third party product rather than a genuine Porsche product but the cause of the wind noise is more than likely resulting from a gap in the adhesive/sealant that was applied before the replacement windscreen was fitted to your car. I had this happen many years ago with a BMW 5 Series, it was fitted by a third party not BMW and not a BMW screen, after 2 attempts to get it right and cure the wind noise the insurance company agreed to have it replaced by BMW, problem was solved.I insure my 911 and Macan through Porsche Insurance which means if I have a windscreen repair or replacement it's done at Porsche and with a genuine Porsche windscreen.","March 15, 2016"

Bat21,"I have recently had my windscreen replace after it was cracked, this was around 3 weeks ago.I now have wind noise which starts at around 45mph, the faster the car goes the noisier it gets.Today by pure chance another Macan turned up at my house, it was the exact same year and model as mine. So I compared his screen fitment to mine as I had heard if there is any gap between the top rubber seal, either screen side or body side, this will be what is creating the noise.Sure enough his was a nice tight seal with no visible gap but mine has a gap both above the rubber and below, you can insert paper in the gaps. There is no water ingress but I suspect this is sure to be what is causing the noise.My Macan is now re booked in to have it corrected.","May 26, 2023"

Build quality.My pet peeve.... Even with Mercedes like the 2022 CLA45, 2022 CLS53, etc... you get issues with interior creaks and rattles. It drives me absolutely crazy lol. For example, I had a 2022 CLS53... AWESOME car, but the driver side mirror rattles whenever I go over a bump, and the seat plastics creek. Unfortunate for a $100k car...The CLA45... Pretty much every thing rattled lol. The door panels rattled like a old BMW, and the rear trunk rattled whenever the car was warming up... You can't even turn the base up because it sounds like the interior is gonna fall apart (it was a new, 2022 lol)Sooooo... my question is: Will I be disappointed in a 2023 Porsche Macan GTS, in terms of build quality such as dashboards rattling or door panels creaking and rattling?I always hear about Porsche and their amazing build quality...

Col Lamb,"You will miss the torque of the SD, but that is all, a little further push of the throttle pedal and the S will shift and way faster than the SD.If that is what you desire, to me a Porsche is about the ease of power delivery and its handling and you only get that combo when there is a surfeit of power a base or T does not fit that criteria.Good luck finding an S to suit but do remember the most important option has to be in the boot.","May 18, 2023"

The reason I am thinking about another car is the £4000 + bill I am paying tomorrow for repairs to my SD which is now 7,5 years old with 54000 miles showing on odometer.  I have no knowledge of differences Gen 2 to Gen 3 so all I can say is looking at Autotrader I could get an S with very low mileage (eg less than 12000) and up to £60k, just hope I can find one with panoramic roof (and ideally a ""full size"" analogue clock on top of the dash).   What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?   By the way, the £4000 + bill tomorrow is to replace all front discs/pads, one rear wheel speed sensor and a complete wiring harness that runs under the car.

I can concur with Col Lamb as my new S had a puncture after only 3 months.Having the spare was a godsend and saved me a load of hassle.Re, your wiring harness.....

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

So I would certainly question having to pay that element of the £4k, and as it has corroded that to me is a component flaw that Porsche should be footing the bill for.In my 55 years of car ownership I have never had any harness fail and my Mechanic Brother had to replace all the wiring in his Mini but that had been under water.","May 20, 2023"

Neil1911,OPCs won't know.  IMHO,"May 23, 2023"
Skyway,Does anyone know if there is a way to prevent the Macan from reducing the music volume when it makes a navigation announcement?I find this too severe with the navigation getting the Lions share of volume.  Adjusting the proportions of output would be even better.I've looked in the manuals and played in the menus and can't see anything.,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Can’t you just mute the nav announcement? I don’t see a nav announcement adding any value given it’s on the screen…I don’t use the Porsche one but Google or Waze and there is a mute icon on both,"May 19, 2023"
Skyway,I have a Speed Camera alert system that runs on my phone via car play which I've noticed uses the navigation volume.  However the music muting seems to be a fixed reduction which in my opinion takes it too low.  On the roads I use the speed camera announcements are vital so I can't mute them,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,So I have set Waze to give me speed camera alerts but mute everything else (in settings on the app). The stereo volume may well reduce for the two seconds of audible alert but no big deal.,"May 19, 2023"
pstrat,What's the alert system? Pray tell,"May 19, 2023"
Neil1911,"I don't believe there is. That, a mute button and/or an option of briefer orders would all meet with my approval.","May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Have you tried physically turning the volume down while navigation is in mid announcement? It then should hold this volume for future announcements.This worked on my Jag…,"May 19, 2023"
Makanik,"You can reduce the navigation volume to zero, so that music will continue uninterrupted - you obviously then lose any speech navigation guidance.But I don’t think there’s any way of adjusting the relative music volume.","May 19, 2023"
Skyway,"I think you’re right, doesn’t seem to be a way. This app is RadarAll and has some limited ability to control the level of voice over device volume so I think I have it is as good as I can get it now.","May 19, 2023"
bennachie,Nav volume is adjusted when the nav announcement is being made.  You can get 'her' to repeat the announcement if you are not quick enough.,"May 20, 2023"
Wing Commander,+1. Exactly what I do.  Turn the volume of the navigation announcer to near zero and you can still hear what’s on the radio or whatever.,"May 20, 2023"
Neil1911,"Agree, you can, BUT it still gets reduced...","May 20, 2023"
FirstSeaLord,"Like others here, I turn down the car's nav volume to zero and then use Waze for navigation and speed camera alerts only (ie not spoken directions). They cut in briefly over whatever I'm streaming via Car Play. Seems to work well. Not sure what happens if listening to the car's radio as I so rarely do. Is that what the original post issue is (Skyway)?BTW how are you finding RadarAll? I tested a bunch of them including RadarAll, and ended up with Waze. Can't remember why I didn't settle with RadarAll. Is it very good then? Would like to try using the car's navigation + a good audible speed camera alert system as then I can have nav (albeit a crappier version vs Waze) in the instrument cluster","May 21, 2023"
Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some. RadarAll is direction sensitive so also only reports cameras in the direction you’re actually driving.","May 21, 2023"

If it were just handling I was personally looking for then I'd buy  a Mini.  Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.  I equally have no time for those doing a ton or excessive speeding, although there are many performance cars that can still stop quicker than a Mondeo doing half that speed if needed.","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"A doubt whether as much as 1% of us have never ever broken a speed limit, be that 20mph, 70mph or whatever.","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"Yes of course we have 100% agree. I think this is more about where you might do it and why…I love the comment “I don’t deem 85mph speeding” - unfortunately the law does, we don’t get to set our own parameters of right and wrong!","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury). Similarly 80 on a clear motorway is almost the norm unless you're driving an EV with sh*t range","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"I’m not anti speed, just commenting on the where (motorway) as there is nothing to be gained here? It’s no more or less fun doing 80mph than 70mph is it?You aren’t going to get to a destination more than literally a few seconds quicker and the whole thing takes place in a straight line on a straight road…On a motorway it just makes way more sense to stick to a speed limit than to try and find where cameras are just so you can go 10 or 15 miles faster??It’s not about what you voted for or what you deem speeding, it’s just about being pragmatic","May 22, 2023"
cowdray2,1,"May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"It's not just about the speed limit.  You can drive miles with variable cameras set to 50 on relatively clear roads where 60 or 70 is fine.  Only a fraction of those gantries have cameras.  I have clients to get to, and artificailly restricting a 'motorway' goes completely against its purpose","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"I honestly think that an indicated 80mph is the unofficial limit on motorways anyway.  I’m positive that no-one would get pulled over for doing an indicated 80mph on a motorway in normal/safe conditions.  You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

Jon A,"You are probably right re limits but not to be super pedantic, your timing assumes constant speed for whole journey, so assuming some off motorway at both ends (with all normal roundabouts, traffic lights etc) that 10 minutes is probably nearer 5 minutes..Either way, saving 5 or 10 minutes as a goal  on an hour and a half journey is pretty puerile I would thinkLike I said, speed limits get broken for all sorts of reasons, including having some fun, but speeding on a motorway is for mugs, just because there is no upside - no more fun and you just can’t save any decent time unless you get up to ton plus speeds so why bother risking it?It really is an interesting social phenomena that people (mostly men) feel they are somehow gaining something by speeding by just a little bit","May 22, 2023"

Skyway,One of the upsides is that by doing that 10mph extra often means you can sit in the outside lane away from all the HGVs and frequent lane changing you see in all those other lanes.  I do alot of MWay driving and it is often way safer in the outside lane,"May 22, 2023"

And the Police, plus speed cameras seem pretty ok with it too.I can think of lots of country lanes/twisties where doing 60 would be mad, despite the limit being 60.Am going to keep an eye out for all these Macan drivers who (allegedly) never go above 70 on a motorway or dual carriageway.","May 22, 2023"

Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

Johnwin,Hi AllI’ve had my S for 3 weeks now and loving it. However have noticed a knocking sound when manoeuvring at low speed - ie stop/start or turning . Sounds like it could be a wiring loom or something similar moving around.Has anyone experienced anything similar?Thanks,"December 15, 2022"
ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"
Johnwin,Good luck Allan - hope you get it rectified soon. The noise I experienced was difficult to pinpoint but did not exhibit when turning wheel when stationary so sounds like it could well be steering column related.,"February 10, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"
andreas,"You hit the nail on the head!  The 2.0 litre has to rev like hell to produce any performance, plus the PDK starts hunting around the gears to try to optimise things.  It's not the relaxed power delivery we get in the larger engined versions.","May 16, 2023"
crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.

azmj,"I must say I was afraid of posting but some really helpful replies - thank you very much for all of the insights.We just have a 6 and 2 year old so the legroom really isn't an issue as it would be with older children.I have a deposit on a Defender 110 as a backup, but I know that the drive/residuals/quality of the Macan will be unrivalled!Heart says Porsche (who's wouldn't?) but just don't want to be kicking myself if it turns out to be too small.Dare I ask of non Cayenne alternatives which will tick those 3 boxes?","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"As I alluded to in my previous post, I would say a BMW X3 M40i would tick most of your box’s (maybe not so much residual (mines only lost 1k but that’s due to this silly market at the moment)But for space it’s huge with a huge boot, performance is  great with 355hp+ 0-62 in around 4.8 they also now have the m-diff. also it can be nice and comfortable as-well if you add the adaptive dampeners.Just a thought!","December 06, 2021"

We get a large parm, a carry on case and some soft bags in the back of our Fiesta and that has less than 300L of space; with the load cover removed the Macan boot must be twice the size.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Col Lamb,"Put a brickunderthe throttle pedal to limit its action, that is how a 2.0 feels, it wants to go but it has not yet grown up.If all one wants is the Porsche badge and a quality feel and look then there is nothing wrong with a 2.0 as a kiddie wagon and shopping trolley it does the job.If on the other hand you are a driving enthusiast then buying a 2.0 is definitely not a wise course of action.One may be deluded into thinking a T is a good choice but come on, the minor handling improvements do not really justify shelling out all the extra cash for the car that is only really of use on the school run","May 17, 2023"

drgav2005,"Not quite Labrador sized but my 3 cocker spaniels easily fit in the boot with the parcel shelf removed. Just watch out for the high sided boot protector, it’s made of fairly slippy plastic so the dogs will move about a bit under cornering","December 05, 2021"
drgav2005,,"December 05, 2021"
Jon A,"I know what you mean and if I had a £100k Taycan I probably wouldn’t put the dogs in but the Macan is an SUV after all and cheaper than a Velar or RRover Sport, both of which would definitely get the dogs!","December 05, 2021"
Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, as I don’t have the Macan yet I can’t really comment, however they both fit in the back of my Wife’s mini with me driving (6ft) so they will be fine in the Macan, though I did have a few wobbles as the Macan in the rear is quite a bit smaller the my X3. But thought sod it I want a PorscheOn the other side I rarely keep a car for more than 18 months so if it doesn’t work I would probably either look at a Cayenne / Macan EV (maybe bigger inside) or back to an X3 but an X3M this time!","December 05, 2021"

davlewis,"As I alluded to in my previous post, I would say a BMW X3 M40i would tick most of your box’s (maybe not so much residual (mines only lost 1k but that’s due to this silly market at the moment)But for space it’s huge with a huge boot, performance is  great with 355hp+ 0-62 in around 4.8 they also now have the m-diff. also it can be nice and comfortable as-well if you add the adaptive dampeners.Just a thought!","December 06, 2021"

We get a large parm, a carry on case and some soft bags in the back of our Fiesta and that has less than 300L of space; with the load cover removed the Macan boot must be twice the size.

Old Chimer,,"December 06, 2021"
BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier. Not allowed to speed around with grandkids and dogs on boardtoo risky","December 06, 2021"
Pivot,"@azmj, you should be fine, depending how much stuff you want to carry around.Many young families fit into Golf-size vehicle. Macan is utter luxury in comparison.I don’t mean to be offensive, just practical. It might take some effort to downsize a little, Macan is a great family ride.","December 06, 2021"

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise. I think the Macan works for 2 kids but any more than that I don’t think it’s a pleasant experience, or even practical if you need 3 boosters.","May 17, 2023"

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

I have 20 years' experience of using it on the teak decks of my last sailboat, as well as on the canvas sprayhood of my current boat.

RGS,"Got a bit off topic here, I just wanted to say my Macan has PDLS plus headlights, if water or condensation can get between the rubber seal under the bonnet and the glass headlight on my car, then its quite possible others will be affected, although maybe less so if garaged. It's really just cosmetic and can be cleaned off, but gives the appearance of being within the unit. I only noticed it in bright sunlight and my car has lived outside since new for over 3 years which might explain.","April 23, 2023"

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this. Well done Porsche.","May 14, 2023"

I borrowed their demo Macan S a few weeks ago for a long weekend away. Handing the car back I joked they better book it back in for the first week in June as we are away for a week in Scotland.Had a phone call on Wednesday asking me to confirm dates I needed the demo car. So it doesn't look like the amp will be coming any time soon.Annoying thing was I upgraded to Burmester after being assured the amp issues were only with BOSE.Doubly annoying, I sold my X3 thinking I'd be driving my new Macan a week later.Trippily annoying, the demo Macan S has BOSE in it.","May 12, 2023"

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Skyway,I have a Speed Camera alert system that runs on my phone via car play which I've noticed uses the navigation volume.  However the music muting seems to be a fixed reduction which in my opinion takes it too low.  On the roads I use the speed camera announcements are vital so I can't mute them,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,So I have set Waze to give me speed camera alerts but mute everything else (in settings on the app). The stereo volume may well reduce for the two seconds of audible alert but no big deal.,"May 19, 2023"

Is that what the original post issue is (Skyway)?BTW how are you finding RadarAll? I tested a bunch of them including RadarAll, and ended up with Waze. Can't remember why I didn't settle with RadarAll. Is it very good then? Would like to try using the car's navigation + a good audible speed camera alert system as then I can have nav (albeit a crappier version vs Waze) in the instrument cluster","May 21, 2023"
Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some.

Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

azmj,"Afternoon,We ordered our Macan GTS following a test drive in August, I was able to get the child seats in no problem and the pram fit in the boot fine but with little room for anything else if I am honest.My wife and I keep contemplating whether the Macan will be too small? we currently have a Touareg.The rear space for both of them was fine, they are both in front facing seats ( I have a 6 year old and a 18 month old) so I don't think legroom would be an issue for anyone.Those with kids of a similar age or older age do you ever feel it is too small when it comes to the luggage space in particular? Anybody else that has made a transition from a Touareg size car to a Macan with a family?Cheers.","December 05, 2021"
Wing Commander,"I think the Touareg is basically similar underneath (platform etc) to the Cayenne, in the same way the Macan was based on the Q5 platform.  So you are essentially downsizing from a Cayenne-sized car to its little brother.  Others on here have gone from Macan to Cayenne with a growing family.  I would at least check out a Cayenne...","December 05, 2021"

Col Lamb,"When our Grandkids were still in their car seats we did have them in our SD and with everything we needed the boot was full.Even now going on holiday to Scotland with just the two of us and our dog, the boot plus half the rear seat was full.So yes with two kids it will be cramped and if you are going to the airport to fly away on holiday then you will probably not have enough space to take all the luggage you want to take.So include roof bars, and a large roof box at minimum on a Macan or look at a Cayenne but even then you may need a roof box.","December 05, 2021"
Jon A,Has anybody had a dog (Labrador size) in the back of the Macan. I took the parcel shelf out of the F-Pace and the two dogs would happily sit in the boot looking over the rear seats - was hoping same for Macan??,"December 05, 2021"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, as I don’t have the Macan yet I can’t really comment, however they both fit in the back of my Wife’s mini with me driving (6ft) so they will be fine in the Macan, though I did have a few wobbles as the Macan in the rear is quite a bit smaller the my X3. But thought sod it I want a PorscheOn the other side I rarely keep a car for more than 18 months so if it doesn’t work I would probably either look at a Cayenne / Macan EV (maybe bigger inside) or back to an X3 but an X3M this time!","December 05, 2021"

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

Pivot,"@azmj, you should be fine, depending how much stuff you want to carry around.Many young families fit into Golf-size vehicle.

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it.

The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

RGS,"Got a bit off topic here, I just wanted to say my Macan has PDLS plus headlights, if water or condensation can get between the rubber seal under the bonnet and the glass headlight on my car, then its quite possible others will be affected, although maybe less so if garaged. It's really just cosmetic and can be cleaned off, but gives the appearance of being within the unit. I only noticed it in bright sunlight and my car has lived outside since new for over 3 years which might explain.","April 23, 2023"

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

stallturn,Have I not read that the UK is adopting EU car regulations?,"May 22, 2023"
pmg,True but Eu regs permit the speed limit control still to be turned off at the start of every journey and I thought so for stop start,"May 22, 2023"
Neil1911,OPCs won't know.  IMHO,"May 23, 2023"
Skyway,Does anyone know if there is a way to prevent the Macan from reducing the music volume when it makes a navigation announcement?I find this too severe with the navigation getting the Lions share of volume.  Adjusting the proportions of output would be even better.I've looked in the manuals and played in the menus and can't see anything.,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Can’t you just mute the nav announcement? I don’t see a nav announcement adding any value given it’s on the screen…I don’t use the Porsche one but Google or Waze and there is a mute icon on both,"May 19, 2023"
Skyway,I have a Speed Camera alert system that runs on my phone via car play which I've noticed uses the navigation volume.  However the music muting seems to be a fixed reduction which in my opinion takes it too low.  On the roads I use the speed camera announcements are vital so I can't mute them,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,So I have set Waze to give me speed camera alerts but mute everything else (in settings on the app). The stereo volume may well reduce for the two seconds of audible alert but no big deal.,"May 19, 2023"
pstrat,What's the alert system? Pray tell,"May 19, 2023"
Neil1911,"I don't believe there is. That, a mute button and/or an option of briefer orders would all meet with my approval.","May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Have you tried physically turning the volume down while navigation is in mid announcement? It then should hold this volume for future announcements.This worked on my Jag…,"May 19, 2023"
Makanik,"You can reduce the navigation volume to zero, so that music will continue uninterrupted - you obviously then lose any speech navigation guidance.But I don’t think there’s any way of adjusting the relative music volume.","May 19, 2023"
Skyway,"I think you’re right, doesn’t seem to be a way. This app is RadarAll and has some limited ability to control the level of voice over device volume so I think I have it is as good as I can get it now.","May 19, 2023"
bennachie,Nav volume is adjusted when the nav announcement is being made.  You can get 'her' to repeat the announcement if you are not quick enough.,"May 20, 2023"
Wing Commander,+1. Exactly what I do.  Turn the volume of the navigation announcer to near zero and you can still hear what’s on the radio or whatever.,"May 20, 2023"
Neil1911,"Agree, you can, BUT it still gets reduced...","May 20, 2023"
FirstSeaLord,"Like others here, I turn down the car's nav volume to zero and then use Waze for navigation and speed camera alerts only (ie not spoken directions). They cut in briefly over whatever I'm streaming via Car Play. Seems to work well. Not sure what happens if listening to the car's radio as I so rarely do. Is that what the original post issue is (Skyway)?BTW how are you finding RadarAll? I tested a bunch of them including RadarAll, and ended up with Waze. Can't remember why I didn't settle with RadarAll. Is it very good then? Would like to try using the car's navigation + a good audible speed camera alert system as then I can have nav (albeit a crappier version vs Waze) in the instrument cluster","May 21, 2023"
Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some. RadarAll is direction sensitive so also only reports cameras in the direction you’re actually driving.","May 21, 2023"

Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.

RGS,"Main difference between a Gen 2 Turbo and GTS is buttons on the centre console instead of black plastic, alcantara headlining is standard as is comfort entry and electric steering adjustment on the steering wheel. 18 way seats are standard with the 14 way a no cost option and with the 2.9 engine, performance is identical to the GTS.

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"

pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times!

Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell. And re the drain from the fuel filler chamber, it’s purpose is to drain water and potentially fuel away safely and keep it away from bodywork and the rear tyre, both of which can be damaged by fuel.","May 09, 2023"

I have to admit that I very rarely opened the roof fully as it gets a bit blustery above about 55mph. I always had the shade open and rear seat passengers always commented on how light and spacious the rear felt with the pano roof.","May 09, 2023"

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port.

It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property.

RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

I really enjoy that the petrol just keeps on going and doesn't run out of breath and plateau (whereas the diesel did for me).The interior is basically the same as your SD. The tech upgrade has been a disappointment for me. The carplay is experience is much worse than my MY18 VW polo.

An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury).

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T .

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Anybody else that has made a transition from a Touareg size car to a Macan with a family?Cheers.","December 05, 2021"
Wing Commander,"I think the Touareg is basically similar underneath (platform etc) to the Cayenne, in the same way the Macan was based on the Q5 platform.  So you are essentially downsizing from a Cayenne-sized car to its little brother.  Others on here have gone from Macan to Cayenne with a growing family.  I would at least check out a Cayenne...","December 05, 2021"

Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

Jolly Porsche specialist RPM Knaresborough won't touch a car under warranty but sent me to York as I am closer to York than to Hull; and when I booked with Bethany I asked if she could adjust her price so it was a little closer than usual to RPM. She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

The economy suffers - 35 average in the SD to 28 mpg average with the GTS' 380 bhp 2.9 engine. Diesel is [currently] dearer than petrol, so the cost per mile difference isn't that great.  Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well.

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Skyway,"I dont deem 80-85 on a clear stretch of motorway in a car like a macan speeding.Also on a twisting winding road in the middle of no where where environmentalists have set the limit to 40 is nuts.  If it were just handling I was personally looking for then I'd buy  a Mini.  Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.  I equally have no time for those doing a ton or excessive speeding, although there are many performance cars that can still stop quicker than a Mondeo doing half that speed if needed.","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"A doubt whether as much as 1% of us have never ever broken a speed limit, be that 20mph, 70mph or whatever.","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"Yes of course we have 100% agree. I think this is more about where you might do it and why…I love the comment “I don’t deem 85mph speeding” - unfortunately the law does, we don’t get to set our own parameters of right and wrong!","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury). Similarly 80 on a clear motorway is almost the norm unless you're driving an EV with sh*t range","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"I’m not anti speed, just commenting on the where (motorway) as there is nothing to be gained here? It’s no more or less fun doing 80mph than 70mph is it?You aren’t going to get to a destination more than literally a few seconds quicker and the whole thing takes place in a straight line on a straight road…On a motorway it just makes way more sense to stick to a speed limit than to try and find where cameras are just so you can go 10 or 15 miles faster??It’s not about what you voted for or what you deem speeding, it’s just about being pragmatic","May 22, 2023"
cowdray2,1,"May 22, 2023"

I have clients to get to, and artificailly restricting a 'motorway' goes completely against its purpose","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"I honestly think that an indicated 80mph is the unofficial limit on motorways anyway.  I’m positive that no-one would get pulled over for doing an indicated 80mph on a motorway in normal/safe conditions.  You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

And the Police, plus speed cameras seem pretty ok with it too.I can think of lots of country lanes/twisties where doing 60 would be mad, despite the limit being 60.Am going to keep an eye out for all these Macan drivers who (allegedly) never go above 70 on a motorway or dual carriageway.","May 22, 2023"

Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly.

It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"
Col Lamb,There was an issue a few years ago with some cars with an incorrectly fitted engine mount.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"
Johnwin,Good luck Allan - hope you get it rectified soon. The noise I experienced was difficult to pinpoint but did not exhibit when turning wheel when stationary so sounds like it could well be steering column related.,"February 10, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

It was even on the correct tyres - Michelin.Also no BOSE and I thought the quality was bad compared to our BOSE carOverall very disappointed and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.","May 17, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"

Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port.

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

Liam is 77 and has been at the PEC for several years.He explained the events for the day and asked if my Wife or Grandson wanted to take part, Wife didn't want to be involved but Grandson obviously wanted to be involved in any possible way he could. At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some. RadarAll is direction sensitive so also only reports cameras in the direction you’re actually driving.","May 21, 2023"

Skyway,"If I was gonna drive like Miss Daisy I wouldn't have bought a Macan or anything like it.  I didn't buy it for its comfortDo you seriously stick to 70mph on all our motorways?  Its very useful to know which gantries definitely have a camera.Also, with all the 20mph speed limits springing up you only have to be doing 25 and you'll get a ticket.","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"Err, yes I really do! Speeding on motorways is a mugs game and you deserve what you get.Much better to enjoy cars like these on the A road twisties where you can enjoy without speeding I think.","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"I dont deem 80-85 on a clear stretch of motorway in a car like a macan speeding.Also on a twisting winding road in the middle of no where where environmentalists have set the limit to 40 is nuts.  If it were just handling I was personally looking for then I'd buy  a Mini.  Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.  I equally have no time for those doing a ton or excessive speeding, although there are many performance cars that can still stop quicker than a Mondeo doing half that speed if needed.","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"A doubt whether as much as 1% of us have never ever broken a speed limit, be that 20mph, 70mph or whatever.","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"Yes of course we have 100% agree. I think this is more about where you might do it and why…I love the comment “I don’t deem 85mph speeding” - unfortunately the law does, we don’t get to set our own parameters of right and wrong!","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury). Similarly 80 on a clear motorway is almost the norm unless you're driving an EV with sh*t range","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"I’m not anti speed, just commenting on the where (motorway) as there is nothing to be gained here? It’s no more or less fun doing 80mph than 70mph is it?You aren’t going to get to a destination more than literally a few seconds quicker and the whole thing takes place in a straight line on a straight road…On a motorway it just makes way more sense to stick to a speed limit than to try and find where cameras are just so you can go 10 or 15 miles faster??It’s not about what you voted for or what you deem speeding, it’s just about being pragmatic","May 22, 2023"
cowdray2,1,"May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"It's not just about the speed limit.  You can drive miles with variable cameras set to 50 on relatively clear roads where 60 or 70 is fine.  Only a fraction of those gantries have cameras.  I have clients to get to, and artificailly restricting a 'motorway' goes completely against its purpose","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"I honestly think that an indicated 80mph is the unofficial limit on motorways anyway.  I’m positive that no-one would get pulled over for doing an indicated 80mph on a motorway in normal/safe conditions.  You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

Jon A,"You are probably right re limits but not to be super pedantic, your timing assumes constant speed for whole journey, so assuming some off motorway at both ends (with all normal roundabouts, traffic lights etc) that 10 minutes is probably nearer 5 minutes..Either way, saving 5 or 10 minutes as a goal  on an hour and a half journey is pretty puerile I would thinkLike I said, speed limits get broken for all sorts of reasons, including having some fun, but speeding on a motorway is for mugs, just because there is no upside - no more fun and you just can’t save any decent time unless you get up to ton plus speeds so why bother risking it?It really is an interesting social phenomena that people (mostly men) feel they are somehow gaining something by speeding by just a little bit","May 22, 2023"

Skyway,One of the upsides is that by doing that 10mph extra often means you can sit in the outside lane away from all the HGVs and frequent lane changing you see in all those other lanes.  I do alot of MWay driving and it is often way safer in the outside lane,"May 22, 2023"

Wing Commander,"Seems like we’re never going to agree on this (as a group, not meaning you & me, Skyway).Motorways are safer to drive on than country lanes/twisties.Some of us are happy that going maybe 80mph on the motorway is perfectly acceptable.  And the Police, plus speed cameras seem pretty ok with it too.I can think of lots of country lanes/twisties where doing 60 would be mad, despite the limit being 60.Am going to keep an eye out for all these Macan drivers who (allegedly) never go above 70 on a motorway or dual carriageway.","May 22, 2023"

Nuclear Nick,"A recent Freedom of Information response (January) from The National Police Chiefs' Council confirmed that the 2015 ACPO Guidelines are still applied across all force areas. This is the document -https://library.college.police.uk/docs/ ... idance.pdfAs you can see, prosecution starts at 10% plus 2mph, so 79 on a motorway. Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly.

Johnwin,Hi AllI’ve had my S for 3 weeks now and loving it. However have noticed a knocking sound when manoeuvring at low speed - ie stop/start or turning . Sounds like it could be a wiring loom or something similar moving around.Has anyone experienced anything similar?Thanks,"December 15, 2022"
ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"
Johnwin,Good luck Allan - hope you get it rectified soon. The noise I experienced was difficult to pinpoint but did not exhibit when turning wheel when stationary so sounds like it could well be steering column related.,"February 10, 2023"

AllanG,"As an update, my car was inspected by my OPC this week, and they sent me a short video, which showed that the heat shield protecting the steering column was rubbing against the column when the steering wheel was turned, and this shield was then touching a lower support brace, which was causing the noise……..photo attached.The remedy was to adjust the heat shield slightly so it wasn’t touching the steering column, or the support brace, and this appears to have resolved the issueHope this may be useful for anyone who’s experiencing a similar noise from their steering column.","February 18, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"
andreas,"You hit the nail on the head!  The 2.0 litre has to rev like hell to produce any performance, plus the PDK starts hunting around the gears to try to optimise things.  It's not the relaxed power delivery we get in the larger engined versions.","May 16, 2023"
crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"
Tracky,"Funnily enough I had a base this week tooNever been a fan of the engine but always thought they felt light on their feet around the twisties.It did see feel that but the steering was horrible on this one. It was a very big spec car, over £70k from what I could work out, and I wonder if it has PS+ because it felt so disconnected and ruined what has always been the highlight of the base car for me. It was even on the correct tyres - Michelin.Also no BOSE and I thought the quality was bad compared to our BOSE carOverall very disappointed and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.","May 17, 2023"

gammaray,"JayEmm on Cars put it best during his Macan T review I think - the base Macan is (to some people) a great “it’ll do” car. But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.  I would imagine the interior quality and feel of a highly specced demo car is a bigger draw than a ‘proper Porsche engine’ for many considering Macan ownership.","May 17, 2023"

Then proceeded to tell me his new Q5 had the 2 litre engine and how he didn't like it, and how Audi didnt let him have any options due to part shortages! So pretty much a base spec Q5.

wab172uk,"Exactly this. There are a lot of people who want the show, but not the go. I think the T looks great. Is it the engine for me?

Col Lamb,"Put a brickunderthe throttle pedal to limit its action, that is how a 2.0 feels, it wants to go but it has not yet grown up.If all one wants is the Porsche badge and a quality feel and look then there is nothing wrong with a 2.0 as a kiddie wagon and shopping trolley it does the job.If on the other hand you are a driving enthusiast then buying a 2.0 is definitely not a wise course of action.One may be deluded into thinking a T is a good choice but come on, the minor handling improvements do not really justify shelling out all the extra cash for the car that is only really of use on the school run","May 17, 2023"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it.

And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise. I think the Macan works for 2 kids but any more than that I don’t think it’s a pleasant experience, or even practical if you need 3 boosters.","May 17, 2023"
James61,"I’ve got two kids ages 7 and 4, and it’s fine. Was a bit tight in the boot on long journeys when we first got it and we’re humping around buggy etc but manageable, and now we don’t have the baby stuff it’s plenty big enough.I also know a couple of other people with two kids and they are fine with it too.You can always have more space but the Macan always just about fits everything we need it to.James","May 17, 2023"

On previous cars have been fixed (Range Rover) so never opened and don't think I will in the Macan either as never like the noise of sunroofs open.I've seen a few posts here about leaks and drain issues etc - so my question is better to just never open (which I'm happy to do) or better to open occasionally to keep things working properly?Not sure!","May 08, 2023"

aj13,"Not sure Simon as I didn't buy new.But I wouldn't say it's a perceived difference second hand...was defo there.What I did note was not that many macans were available without panroof, and when I was looking for a good 3-4 months, the non panroof ones seemed to be for sale for longer.Maybe that indicates that Porsche salesmen did there job well when people ordered new ones?","May 08, 2023"

Wing Commander,"I agree with regard to a pano roof (not that I’d ever spec one).With regard to the fuel filler cavity and the windscreen scuttle, I think it’s profiteering.  Neither would lead to water leaking to the interior of the car and both would be pretty blinkin’ obvious to the casual observer.","May 09, 2023"
2japs,"Yeah, get that.With the Macan there seems to be one or two extra bits of maintenance I never even considered with previous cars, the Pano roof drains and screen wash strength re the freezing issue. I asked at handover what strength the washer fluid was and didn’t seem to know, just shown the refill cap and recommended to get a jug with a spoutNever worried about anything with first Macan, although it required a oil service after 12 months, having said that I only had it 18months.","May 09, 2023"
Wing Commander,"Car asking for an oil change after a year is common, with ‘Audi’ engines.  My Panamera 4 wanted an oil change at 10k miles after only about 7 months!  (Mostly motorway miles.)The technical knowledge of the average SE is way below many of the folks on here!","May 09, 2023"
Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell. And re the drain from the fuel filler chamber, it’s purpose is to drain water and potentially fuel away safely and keep it away from bodywork and the rear tyre, both of which can be damaged by fuel.","May 09, 2023"
Wing Commander,"This is why you’re my technical/mechanical guru, Nick!But I still maintain that a drain blockage in either of those locations should be easily spotted (and subsequently rectified) by an observant owner.","May 09, 2023"
Scooby_Doo,"My last three MB's have had a pano roof and never had any problems with blocked drains,(cars always parked in the garage) is it just a Porsche problem. I'd always spec the pano roof purely for the brighter interior and the option to tilt the roof for some draught free ventilation. I have to admit that I very rarely opened the roof fully as it gets a bit blustery above about 55mph. I always had the shade open and rear seat passengers always commented on how light and spacious the rear felt with the pano roof.","May 09, 2023"
SAC1,"The panoramic roof in the Macan is great. Had one on both my Macans and use it tilted and fully open during sunny weather a lot.Rarely have the blind across as prefer the extra light that it gives.Never garaged, but never parked under trees.  Never had any problems with water ingress in 6 years combined use.My OPC did try and charge to service the GTS' roof at the 1st service, at 2yrs old, but I refused to pay for it.","May 09, 2023"
Kleynie,"Just do what I do and don’t park under trees and keep the drains clear with a Henry Hoover.Also, cut the drain ends off as they restrict the flow and cause the blockage.","May 09, 2023"

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"
HertsMacan,"BTW - Never ever pay any deposits by bank transfer only by credit card. Believe me, car dealerships can go under and be here today as normal and gone tomorrow.

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port.

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

I bought at Hull (shout out for Matthew Symons) but used York for an extra oil service at 3,000 miles in case there were any rough edges floating around in the engine after a careful running in. Jolly Porsche specialist RPM Knaresborough won't touch a car under warranty but sent me to York as I am closer to York than to Hull; and when I booked with Bethany I asked if she could adjust her price so it was a little closer than usual to RPM. She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts. York are friendly and welcoming and want our business. You are aware, aren't you, that another PCGB perk is a WEX card - which gives you 6p/litre off Synergy 99?

Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well.

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Jon A,"Yes of course we have 100% agree. I think this is more about where you might do it and why…I love the comment “I don’t deem 85mph speeding” - unfortunately the law does, we don’t get to set our own parameters of right and wrong!","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury). Similarly 80 on a clear motorway is almost the norm unless you're driving an EV with sh*t range","May 22, 2023"
Jon A,"I’m not anti speed, just commenting on the where (motorway) as there is nothing to be gained here? It’s no more or less fun doing 80mph than 70mph is it?You aren’t going to get to a destination more than literally a few seconds quicker and the whole thing takes place in a straight line on a straight road…On a motorway it just makes way more sense to stick to a speed limit than to try and find where cameras are just so you can go 10 or 15 miles faster??It’s not about what you voted for or what you deem speeding, it’s just about being pragmatic","May 22, 2023"
cowdray2,1,"May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"It's not just about the speed limit.  You can drive miles with variable cameras set to 50 on relatively clear roads where 60 or 70 is fine.  Only a fraction of those gantries have cameras.  I have clients to get to, and artificailly restricting a 'motorway' goes completely against its purpose","May 22, 2023"
Wing Commander,"I honestly think that an indicated 80mph is the unofficial limit on motorways anyway.  I’m positive that no-one would get pulled over for doing an indicated 80mph on a motorway in normal/safe conditions.  You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

Jon A,"You are probably right re limits but not to be super pedantic, your timing assumes constant speed for whole journey, so assuming some off motorway at both ends (with all normal roundabouts, traffic lights etc) that 10 minutes is probably nearer 5 minutes..Either way, saving 5 or 10 minutes as a goal  on an hour and a half journey is pretty puerile I would thinkLike I said, speed limits get broken for all sorts of reasons, including having some fun, but speeding on a motorway is for mugs, just because there is no upside - no more fun and you just can’t save any decent time unless you get up to ton plus speeds so why bother risking it?It really is an interesting social phenomena that people (mostly men) feel they are somehow gaining something by speeding by just a little bit","May 22, 2023"

Skyway,One of the upsides is that by doing that 10mph extra often means you can sit in the outside lane away from all the HGVs and frequent lane changing you see in all those other lanes.  I do alot of MWay driving and it is often way safer in the outside lane,"May 22, 2023"

Wing Commander,"Seems like we’re never going to agree on this (as a group, not meaning you & me, Skyway).Motorways are safer to drive on than country lanes/twisties.Some of us are happy that going maybe 80mph on the motorway is perfectly acceptable.  And the Police, plus speed cameras seem pretty ok with it too.I can think of lots of country lanes/twisties where doing 60 would be mad, despite the limit being 60.Am going to keep an eye out for all these Macan drivers who (allegedly) never go above 70 on a motorway or dual carriageway.","May 22, 2023"

This is the document -https://library.college.police.uk/docs/ ... idance.pdfAs you can see, prosecution starts at 10% plus 2mph, so 79 on a motorway. Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly.

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"
Johnwin,Good luck Allan - hope you get it rectified soon. The noise I experienced was difficult to pinpoint but did not exhibit when turning wheel when stationary so sounds like it could well be steering column related.,"February 10, 2023"

AllanG,"As an update, my car was inspected by my OPC this week, and they sent me a short video, which showed that the heat shield protecting the steering column was rubbing against the column when the steering wheel was turned, and this shield was then touching a lower support brace, which was causing the noise……..photo attached.The remedy was to adjust the heat shield slightly so it wasn’t touching the steering column, or the support brace, and this appears to have resolved the issueHope this may be useful for anyone who’s experiencing a similar noise from their steering column.","February 18, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"
andreas,"You hit the nail on the head!  The 2.0 litre has to rev like hell to produce any performance, plus the PDK starts hunting around the gears to try to optimise things.  It's not the relaxed power delivery we get in the larger engined versions.","May 16, 2023"
crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"
Tracky,"Funnily enough I had a base this week tooNever been a fan of the engine but always thought they felt light on their feet around the twisties.It did see feel that but the steering was horrible on this one. It was a very big spec car, over £70k from what I could work out, and I wonder if it has PS+ because it felt so disconnected and ruined what has always been the highlight of the base car for me. It was even on the correct tyres - Michelin.Also no BOSE and I thought the quality was bad compared to our BOSE carOverall very disappointed and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.","May 17, 2023"

gammaray,"JayEmm on Cars put it best during his Macan T review I think - the base Macan is (to some people) a great “it’ll do” car. But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.  I would imagine the interior quality and feel of a highly specced demo car is a bigger draw than a ‘proper Porsche engine’ for many considering Macan ownership.","May 17, 2023"

Came back to see him inspecting/admiring my GTS. Then proceeded to tell me his new Q5 had the 2 litre engine and how he didn't like it, and how Audi didnt let him have any options due to part shortages! So pretty much a base spec Q5. Asked me a bunch of questions about the Macan and sounded like he was going to pay Porsche a visit off the back of it. Was thrilled when I started the car haha","May 17, 2023"

Col Lamb,"Put a brickunderthe throttle pedal to limit its action, that is how a 2.0 feels, it wants to go but it has not yet grown up.If all one wants is the Porsche badge and a quality feel and look then there is nothing wrong with a 2.0 as a kiddie wagon and shopping trolley it does the job.If on the other hand you are a driving enthusiast then buying a 2.0 is definitely not a wise course of action.One may be deluded into thinking a T is a good choice but come on, the minor handling improvements do not really justify shelling out all the extra cash for the car that is only really of use on the school run","May 17, 2023"

And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise.

On previous cars have been fixed (Range Rover) so never opened and don't think I will in the Macan either as never like the noise of sunroofs open.I've seen a few posts here about leaks and drain issues etc - so my question is better to just never open (which I'm happy to do) or better to open occasionally to keep things working properly?Not sure!","May 08, 2023"

Wing Commander,"I agree with regard to a pano roof (not that I’d ever spec one).With regard to the fuel filler cavity and the windscreen scuttle, I think it’s profiteering.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell. And re the drain from the fuel filler chamber, it’s purpose is to drain water and potentially fuel away safely and keep it away from bodywork and the rear tyre, both of which can be damaged by fuel.","May 09, 2023"

Scooby_Doo,"My last three MB's have had a pano roof and never had any problems with blocked drains,(cars always parked in the garage) is it just a Porsche problem. I'd always spec the pano roof purely for the brighter interior and the option to tilt the roof for some draught free ventilation. I have to admit that I very rarely opened the roof fully as it gets a bit blustery above about 55mph. I always had the shade open and rear seat passengers always commented on how light and spacious the rear felt with the pano roof.","May 09, 2023"
SAC1,"The panoramic roof in the Macan is great. Had one on both my Macans and use it tilted and fully open during sunny weather a lot.Rarely have the blind across as prefer the extra light that it gives.Never garaged, but never parked under trees.

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"
HertsMacan,"BTW - Never ever pay any deposits by bank transfer only by credit card. Believe me, car dealerships can go under and be here today as normal and gone tomorrow.

RGS,"Got a bit off topic here, I just wanted to say my Macan has PDLS plus headlights, if water or condensation can get between the rubber seal under the bonnet and the glass headlight on my car, then its quite possible others will be affected, although maybe less so if garaged. It's really just cosmetic and can be cleaned off, but gives the appearance of being within the unit. I only noticed it in bright sunlight and my car has lived outside since new for over 3 years which might explain.","April 23, 2023"

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

Jolly Porsche specialist RPM Knaresborough won't touch a car under warranty but sent me to York as I am closer to York than to Hull; and when I booked with Bethany I asked if she could adjust her price so it was a little closer than usual to RPM. She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury).

RGS,"Main difference between a Gen 2 Turbo and GTS is buttons on the centre console instead of black plastic, alcantara headlining is standard as is comfort entry and electric steering adjustment on the steering wheel. 18 way seats are standard with the 14 way a no cost option and with the 2.9 engine, performance is identical to the GTS.

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T .

gammaray,"JayEmm on Cars put it best during his Macan T review I think - the base Macan is (to some people) a great “it’ll do” car. But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.  I would imagine the interior quality and feel of a highly specced demo car is a bigger draw than a ‘proper Porsche engine’ for many considering Macan ownership.","May 17, 2023"

pstrat,"I haven't driven the 2.0 engined Macan yet, maybe I will when I need a loaner myself.Had an interesting chat with a guy in Costco car park the other week. Came back to see him inspecting/admiring my GTS. Then proceeded to tell me his new Q5 had the 2 litre engine and how he didn't like it, and how Audi didnt let him have any options due to part shortages! So pretty much a base spec Q5. Asked me a bunch of questions about the Macan and sounded like he was going to pay Porsche a visit off the back of it. Was thrilled when I started the car haha","May 17, 2023"
wab172uk,"Exactly this. There are a lot of people who want the show, but not the go. I think the T looks great. Is it the engine for me? No. But not everyone wants or needs 380bhp to take the kids to school and then to potter to work or the shops.If I was buying a Macan for the Missus, I would get her the T.","May 17, 2023"
Col Lamb,"Put a brickunderthe throttle pedal to limit its action, that is how a 2.0 feels, it wants to go but it has not yet grown up.If all one wants is the Porsche badge and a quality feel and look then there is nothing wrong with a 2.0 as a kiddie wagon and shopping trolley it does the job.If on the other hand you are a driving enthusiast then buying a 2.0 is definitely not a wise course of action.One may be deluded into thinking a T is a good choice but come on, the minor handling improvements do not really justify shelling out all the extra cash for the car that is only really of use on the school run","May 17, 2023"

azmj,"Afternoon,We ordered our Macan GTS following a test drive in August, I was able to get the child seats in no problem and the pram fit in the boot fine but with little room for anything else if I am honest.My wife and I keep contemplating whether the Macan will be too small? we currently have a Touareg.The rear space for both of them was fine, they are both in front facing seats ( I have a 6 year old and a 18 month old) so I don't think legroom would be an issue for anyone.Those with kids of a similar age or older age do you ever feel it is too small when it comes to the luggage space in particular? Anybody else that has made a transition from a Touareg size car to a Macan with a family?Cheers.","December 05, 2021"
Wing Commander,"I think the Touareg is basically similar underneath (platform etc) to the Cayenne, in the same way the Macan was based on the Q5 platform.  So you are essentially downsizing from a Cayenne-sized car to its little brother.  Others on here have gone from Macan to Cayenne with a growing family.  I would at least check out a Cayenne...","December 05, 2021"

Col Lamb,"When our Grandkids were still in their car seats we did have them in our SD and with everything we needed the boot was full.Even now going on holiday to Scotland with just the two of us and our dog, the boot plus half the rear seat was full.So yes with two kids it will be cramped and if you are going to the airport to fly away on holiday then you will probably not have enough space to take all the luggage you want to take.So include roof bars, and a large roof box at minimum on a Macan or look at a Cayenne but even then you may need a roof box.","December 05, 2021"
Jon A,Has anybody had a dog (Labrador size) in the back of the Macan. I took the parcel shelf out of the F-Pace and the two dogs would happily sit in the boot looking over the rear seats - was hoping same for Macan??,"December 05, 2021"

drgav2005,,"December 05, 2021"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, as I don’t have the Macan yet I can’t really comment, however they both fit in the back of my Wife’s mini with me driving (6ft) so they will be fine in the Macan, though I did have a few wobbles as the Macan in the rear is quite a bit smaller the my X3. But thought sod it I want a PorscheOn the other side I rarely keep a car for more than 18 months so if it doesn’t work I would probably either look at a Cayenne / Macan EV (maybe bigger inside) or back to an X3 but an X3M this time!","December 05, 2021"

davlewis,"As I alluded to in my previous post, I would say a BMW X3 M40i would tick most of your box’s (maybe not so much residual (mines only lost 1k but that’s due to this silly market at the moment)But for space it’s huge with a huge boot, performance is  great with 355hp+ 0-62 in around 4.8 they also now have the m-diff. also it can be nice and comfortable as-well if you add the adaptive dampeners.Just a thought!","December 06, 2021"

Old Chimer,,"December 06, 2021"
BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier. Not allowed to speed around with grandkids and dogs on boardtoo risky","December 06, 2021"
Pivot,"@azmj, you should be fine, depending how much stuff you want to carry around.Many young families fit into Golf-size vehicle. Macan is utter luxury in comparison.I don’t mean to be offensive, just practical. It might take some effort to downsize a little, Macan is a great family ride.","December 06, 2021"

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise. I think the Macan works for 2 kids but any more than that I don’t think it’s a pleasant experience, or even practical if you need 3 boosters.","May 17, 2023"
James61,"I’ve got two kids ages 7 and 4, and it’s fine. Was a bit tight in the boot on long journeys when we first got it and we’re humping around buggy etc but manageable, and now we don’t have the baby stuff it’s plenty big enough.I also know a couple of other people with two kids and they are fine with it too.You can always have more space but the Macan always just about fits everything we need it to.James","May 17, 2023"

Wing Commander,This has come up before.The usual deposit is £3k.  £5k for a 911.I only paid the initial deposit on my three new Porsche orders.It seems that some OPCs do request a top-up deposit prior to collection...,"April 12, 2023"
Tracky,Yes sytner do thisHardly an issue if you are committed to the car !,"April 12, 2023"
Macananon,I've only paid 3k to Sytner Solihull for my BGTS thats now in build.  !!,"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,Why should anyone have to do this if it’s not Porsche standard practice. I’d point blank refuse. If anything I’d have placed 2 x £3K with different dealers rather than £6-£7K to one.,"April 12, 2023"
Tracky,Why would you not?,"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,Never pay anyone more than you need to is my motto in life,"April 12, 2023"
Tracky,But it is towards what you have to pay anyway!?,"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,I’d rather have the money earning interest for me not for someone else,"April 12, 2023"
Col Lamb,"We have heard of this before, personally I would not buy a broken down wreck from certain dealerships never mind a £70k+ motor.First thought, cancel order and move to another OPC.£3k is all that is required as standard by Porsche until a buyer collects.The OPC will not be sent an invoice from Porsche Germany until well after the car has left the factory compound so the OPC has plenty of time to receive the cash from the buyer and to pay the invoice.ButIf they can deliver earlier and you do not mind then it is up to you","April 12, 2023"
Tracky,And how much is that going to amount to…,"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,It’s principle.  As Col has stated Porsche don’t need more than 3K. I bet if you tell them you’d like to check out the arrangements with Porsche GB they’d back track instantly.,"April 12, 2023"
crockers,Around £10 - £12 a month. (Before tax),"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,Tell yourself it’s okay if they suddenly went bankrupt. You wouldnt see the extra money for months if not years returnedPay only what is required which is £3K. If they want more ask for a legal commitment that they can deliver your car in the 6 months in return. Bet you don’t get it!,"April 12, 2023"
Tracky,ExactlyI’ve found I’ve got my cars quicker than most through Sytner so worth losing a bit of loose change,"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,"It’s more than a £12 loss if they went bankrupt!Anyway, this has got boring. I personally wouldn’t pay a car dealer a cent more than I had too. These car dealers don’t exactly reciprocate anything in my experience.","April 12, 2023"
HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"
HertsMacan,"BTW - Never ever pay any deposits by bank transfer only by credit card. Believe me, car dealerships can go under and be here today as normal and gone tomorrow. If you paid your deposit by bank transfer you are likely to get little if anything back.  Deposits by credit card are safe and refunded under section 75 by the card issuer.","April 13, 2023"
Tracky,which many dealers won't take that much on a credit card,"April 13, 2023"

Tracky,Yea the £3k but not anything after that !They don’t like the charges!,"April 14, 2023"
Wing Commander,"+1.  On a previous purchase, I got an OPC to take a bit more than the initial deposit, but as Tracky says, paying by credit card involves the OPC incurring higher transaction costs compared to debit card or bank transfer etc.","April 14, 2023"
crockers,Swindon took CC for deposit. I transferred the balance 2 days before collection.I do believe that if any part of the purchase is made by CC it protects the total purchase. But I do stand yo be corrected.,"April 14, 2023"
2japs,"Yes, I paid deposit via CC as I do with anything.Here’s a thought if you decide to cancel, I wonder if they would give you back the deposit minus the credit card charge?","April 15, 2023"
Wing Commander,"In 7.5 years on here, I have never heard of that.  I’m sure you’d get the full £3k back (for Macan) prior to lockdown and there will certainly be someone happy to take an earlier cancelled build slot.","April 15, 2023"

Wing Commander,Fingers crossed for you!,"April 15, 2023"

Not only that I had taken the PEC day and never got charged for that either.

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Neil1911,OPCs won't know.  IMHO,"May 23, 2023"
Skyway,Does anyone know if there is a way to prevent the Macan from reducing the music volume when it makes a navigation announcement?I find this too severe with the navigation getting the Lions share of volume.  Adjusting the proportions of output would be even better.I've looked in the manuals and played in the menus and can't see anything.,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Can’t you just mute the nav announcement? I don’t see a nav announcement adding any value given it’s on the screen…I don’t use the Porsche one but Google or Waze and there is a mute icon on both,"May 19, 2023"
Skyway,I have a Speed Camera alert system that runs on my phone via car play which I've noticed uses the navigation volume.  However the music muting seems to be a fixed reduction which in my opinion takes it too low.  On the roads I use the speed camera announcements are vital so I can't mute them,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,So I have set Waze to give me speed camera alerts but mute everything else (in settings on the app). The stereo volume may well reduce for the two seconds of audible alert but no big deal.,"May 19, 2023"
pstrat,What's the alert system? Pray tell,"May 19, 2023"
Neil1911,"I don't believe there is. That, a mute button and/or an option of briefer orders would all meet with my approval.","May 19, 2023"
Jon A,Have you tried physically turning the volume down while navigation is in mid announcement? It then should hold this volume for future announcements.This worked on my Jag…,"May 19, 2023"
Makanik,"You can reduce the navigation volume to zero, so that music will continue uninterrupted - you obviously then lose any speech navigation guidance.But I don’t think there’s any way of adjusting the relative music volume.","May 19, 2023"
Skyway,"I think you’re right, doesn’t seem to be a way. This app is RadarAll and has some limited ability to control the level of voice over device volume so I think I have it is as good as I can get it now.","May 19, 2023"
bennachie,Nav volume is adjusted when the nav announcement is being made.  You can get 'her' to repeat the announcement if you are not quick enough.,"May 20, 2023"
Wing Commander,+1. Exactly what I do.  Turn the volume of the navigation announcer to near zero and you can still hear what’s on the radio or whatever.,"May 20, 2023"
Neil1911,"Agree, you can, BUT it still gets reduced...","May 20, 2023"
FirstSeaLord,"Like others here, I turn down the car's nav volume to zero and then use Waze for navigation and speed camera alerts only (ie not spoken directions). They cut in briefly over whatever I'm streaming via Car Play. Seems to work well. Not sure what happens if listening to the car's radio as I so rarely do. Is that what the original post issue is (Skyway)?BTW how are you finding RadarAll? I tested a bunch of them including RadarAll, and ended up with Waze. Can't remember why I didn't settle with RadarAll. Is it very good then? Would like to try using the car's navigation + a good audible speed camera alert system as then I can have nav (albeit a crappier version vs Waze) in the instrument cluster","May 21, 2023"
Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some. RadarAll is direction sensitive so also only reports cameras in the direction you’re actually driving.","May 21, 2023"
Jon A,The other thing you could do is just stick to the speed limit. I have speed limit display and find it very easy to not speed…,"May 22, 2023"

Jon A,"Err, yes I really do! Speeding on motorways is a mugs game and you deserve what you get.Much better to enjoy cars like these on the A road twisties where you can enjoy without speeding I think.","May 22, 2023"
Skyway,"I dont deem 80-85 on a clear stretch of motorway in a car like a macan speeding.Also on a twisting winding road in the middle of no where where environmentalists have set the limit to 40 is nuts.  If it were just handling I was personally looking for then I'd buy  a Mini.  Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.  I equally have no time for those doing a ton or excessive speeding, although there are many performance cars that can still stop quicker than a Mondeo doing half that speed if needed.","May 22, 2023"

RGS,"Main difference between a Gen 2 Turbo and GTS is buttons on the centre console instead of black plastic, alcantara headlining is standard as is comfort entry and electric steering adjustment on the steering wheel. 18 way seats are standard with the 14 way a no cost option and with the 2.9 engine, performance is identical to the GTS.

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

gammaray,"JayEmm on Cars put it best during his Macan T review I think - the base Macan is (to some people) a great “it’ll do” car. But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise.

Wing Commander,"I agree with regard to a pano roof (not that I’d ever spec one).With regard to the fuel filler cavity and the windscreen scuttle, I think it’s profiteering.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell. And re the drain from the fuel filler chamber, it’s purpose is to drain water and potentially fuel away safely and keep it away from bodywork and the rear tyre, both of which can be damaged by fuel.","May 09, 2023"

I'd always spec the pano roof purely for the brighter interior and the option to tilt the roof for some draught free ventilation. I have to admit that I very rarely opened the roof fully as it gets a bit blustery above about 55mph. I always had the shade open and rear seat passengers always commented on how light and spacious the rear felt with the pano roof.","May 09, 2023"

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port.

For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Out performs a Macan on those types of roads by a mileI'm not talking about going crazy here, but I suspect over 90% of drivers on this forum break the speed limits.  Knowing where the cameras are just helps prevent getting a ticket for a minor revenue driven offence.

Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury).

You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause.

I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"

The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

Skyway,It’s principle.  As Col has stated Porsche don’t need more than 3K. I bet if you tell them you’d like to check out the arrangements with Porsche GB they’d back track instantly.,"April 12, 2023"
crockers,Around £10 - £12 a month. (Before tax),"April 12, 2023"
Skyway,Tell yourself it’s okay if they suddenly went bankrupt. You wouldnt see the extra money for months if not years returnedPay only what is required which is £3K. If they want more ask for a legal commitment that they can deliver your car in the 6 months in return. Bet you don’t get it!,"April 12, 2023"

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"
HertsMacan,"BTW - Never ever pay any deposits by bank transfer only by credit card. Believe me, car dealerships can go under and be here today as normal and gone tomorrow. If you paid your deposit by bank transfer you are likely to get little if anything back.  Deposits by credit card are safe and refunded under section 75 by the card issuer.","April 13, 2023"

Wing Commander,"+1.  On a previous purchase, I got an OPC to take a bit more than the initial deposit, but as Tracky says, paying by credit card involves the OPC incurring higher transaction costs compared to debit card or bank transfer etc.","April 14, 2023"
crockers,Swindon took CC for deposit. I transferred the balance 2 days before collection.I do believe that if any part of the purchase is made by CC it protects the total purchase. But I do stand yo be corrected.,"April 14, 2023"

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

I resorted to just taking my guest unannounced and the guy checking us in offered the opportunity to share the driving, unprompted.  So if all else fails just ask when you check in.

Liam is 77 and has been at the PEC for several years.He explained the events for the day and asked if my Wife or Grandson wanted to take part, Wife didn't want to be involved but Grandson obviously wanted to be involved in any possible way he could. At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

Jolly Porsche specialist RPM Knaresborough won't touch a car under warranty but sent me to York as I am closer to York than to Hull; and when I booked with Bethany I asked if she could adjust her price so it was a little closer than usual to RPM. She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury).

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T .

That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Anybody else that has made a transition from a Touareg size car to a Macan with a family?Cheers.","December 05, 2021"
Wing Commander,"I think the Touareg is basically similar underneath (platform etc) to the Cayenne, in the same way the Macan was based on the Q5 platform.  So you are essentially downsizing from a Cayenne-sized car to its little brother.  Others on here have gone from Macan to Cayenne with a growing family.  I would at least check out a Cayenne...","December 05, 2021"

Col Lamb,"When our Grandkids were still in their car seats we did have them in our SD and with everything we needed the boot was full.Even now going on holiday to Scotland with just the two of us and our dog, the boot plus half the rear seat was full.So yes with two kids it will be cramped and if you are going to the airport to fly away on holiday then you will probably not have enough space to take all the luggage you want to take.So include roof bars, and a large roof box at minimum on a Macan or look at a Cayenne but even then you may need a roof box.","December 05, 2021"
Jon A,Has anybody had a dog (Labrador size) in the back of the Macan. I took the parcel shelf out of the F-Pace and the two dogs would happily sit in the boot looking over the rear seats - was hoping same for Macan??,"December 05, 2021"

drgav2005,,"December 05, 2021"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, as I don’t have the Macan yet I can’t really comment, however they both fit in the back of my Wife’s mini with me driving (6ft) so they will be fine in the Macan, though I did have a few wobbles as the Macan in the rear is quite a bit smaller the my X3. But thought sod it I want a PorscheOn the other side I rarely keep a car for more than 18 months so if it doesn’t work I would probably either look at a Cayenne / Macan EV (maybe bigger inside) or back to an X3 but an X3M this time!","December 05, 2021"

davlewis,"As I alluded to in my previous post, I would say a BMW X3 M40i would tick most of your box’s (maybe not so much residual (mines only lost 1k but that’s due to this silly market at the moment)But for space it’s huge with a huge boot, performance is  great with 355hp+ 0-62 in around 4.8 they also now have the m-diff. also it can be nice and comfortable as-well if you add the adaptive dampeners.Just a thought!","December 06, 2021"

Old Chimer,,"December 06, 2021"
BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier. Not allowed to speed around with grandkids and dogs on boardtoo risky","December 06, 2021"
Pivot,"@azmj, you should be fine, depending how much stuff you want to carry around.Many young families fit into Golf-size vehicle. Macan is utter luxury in comparison.I don’t mean to be offensive, just practical. It might take some effort to downsize a little, Macan is a great family ride.","December 06, 2021"

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise. I think the Macan works for 2 kids but any more than that I don’t think it’s a pleasant experience, or even practical if you need 3 boosters.","May 17, 2023"

The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

Liam is 77 and has been at the PEC for several years.He explained the events for the day and asked if my Wife or Grandson wanted to take part, Wife didn't want to be involved but Grandson obviously wanted to be involved in any possible way he could. At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick. Learnt a few things about my car and definitely appreciate it now more than I did. Liam was a Superstar. The organisation for everything was perfect. Fully recommend everyone to do this. Well done Porsche.","May 14, 2023"

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive.

I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Skyway,I have a Speed Camera alert system that runs on my phone via car play which I've noticed uses the navigation volume.  However the music muting seems to be a fixed reduction which in my opinion takes it too low.  On the roads I use the speed camera announcements are vital so I can't mute them,"May 19, 2023"
Jon A,So I have set Waze to give me speed camera alerts but mute everything else (in settings on the app). The stereo volume may well reduce for the two seconds of audible alert but no big deal.,"May 19, 2023"

Jon A,Have you tried physically turning the volume down while navigation is in mid announcement? It then should hold this volume for future announcements.This worked on my Jag…,"May 19, 2023"
Makanik,"You can reduce the navigation volume to zero, so that music will continue uninterrupted - you obviously then lose any speech navigation guidance.But I don’t think there’s any way of adjusting the relative music volume.","May 19, 2023"

bennachie,Nav volume is adjusted when the nav announcement is being made.  You can get 'her' to repeat the announcement if you are not quick enough.,"May 20, 2023"
Wing Commander,+1. Exactly what I do.  Turn the volume of the navigation announcer to near zero and you can still hear what’s on the radio or whatever.,"May 20, 2023"
Neil1911,"Agree, you can, BUT it still gets reduced...","May 20, 2023"
FirstSeaLord,"Like others here, I turn down the car's nav volume to zero and then use Waze for navigation and speed camera alerts only (ie not spoken directions). They cut in briefly over whatever I'm streaming via Car Play. Seems to work well. Not sure what happens if listening to the car's radio as I so rarely do. Is that what the original post issue is (Skyway)?BTW how are you finding RadarAll? I tested a bunch of them including RadarAll, and ended up with Waze. Can't remember why I didn't settle with RadarAll. Is it very good then? Would like to try using the car's navigation + a good audible speed camera alert system as then I can have nav (albeit a crappier version vs Waze) in the instrument cluster","May 21, 2023"
Skyway,"So I’ve been looking for something that integrates better with CarPlay than Cyclops, and RadarAll so far has been very accurate. Also I’ve been finding Waze increasing disappointing for navigation so have been trialling Apple Maps and so far I’m impressed, particularly with road closures and clarity of turn information. Things like ‘go over the next set of lights then turn…’.I don’t like to rely on the navigation systems for cameras as they often miss some. RadarAll is direction sensitive so also only reports cameras in the direction you’re actually driving.","May 21, 2023"

Hence on a motorway you will generally not be prosecuted up to 78mph. But as the guideline says, Police Offices can exercise judgement in all cases and experience shows that they are much more likely to prosecute for lower transgressions in, say, 30mph limits outside a school, or in other areas where speeding is a known problem.For interest, both my Porsches have/had a speedo error of plus 2mph across the range, measured using a satnav, which is close to accurate in practice.","May 23, 2023"

As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates. Otherwise stick to GTS for Gen 2","May 01, 2023"

ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T .

That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain.

It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"

The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

happy days,"I had a similar issue with my high-mileage SD recently. The initial warning soon turned to be an adblue specific message warning that in 600 miles the car could not be started. Apparently, the adblue crystalises in the pipes and in the injector over time and stops the flow into the exhaust. Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port. I got lucky as mine turned out to be a split in the pipe only. Still, I was relieved of £245 for a replacement. My local indy now stocks an additive to reduce the crystals forming.","May 16, 2023"

I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

RGS,"Got a bit off topic here, I just wanted to say my Macan has PDLS plus headlights, if water or condensation can get between the rubber seal under the bonnet and the glass headlight on my car, then its quite possible others will be affected, although maybe less so if garaged. It's really just cosmetic and can be cleaned off, but gives the appearance of being within the unit. I only noticed it in bright sunlight and my car has lived outside since new for over 3 years which might explain.","April 23, 2023"

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

Skyway,"Exactly.  That's why we need the mitigation of speed camera software (for which several million subscribers exist btw).  I drove 5 miles on the M40 the other day and the only reason it was set to 60 was for environmental protection (I don't remember voting for this).  An empty motorway and 90% of us were not doing the 50mph that the 'law' wanted.I'm not suggesting an utter flought of the law here, but in many cases the 'the law is an ass'.  If I couldn't drive my Macan enthusiastically from time to time then I'd sell it.  I also wouldn't buy it in the first place if it was speed restricted to 70mph.  If anyone on here says they would then I'd suggest they're lying through their teethI don't think where this might happen even came into the discussion btw.  Clearly no one apart from an idiot would do 70 in a 20 zone.  But it'd be very easy to do 25 in one (as per the Archbishop of Canterbury).

You can in fact drive at an indicated 80mph past gantries with speed cameras with no issues (according to a friend).And not to be pendatic, but if doing 80 rather than 70, you’d complete a 100 mile journey in about 10.7 minutes less time.","May 22, 2023"

Johnwin,Hi AllI’ve had my S for 3 weeks now and loving it. However have noticed a knocking sound when manoeuvring at low speed - ie stop/start or turning . Sounds like it could be a wiring loom or something similar moving around.Has anyone experienced anything similar?Thanks,"December 15, 2022"
ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

AllanG,"Thanks for this update, John, and pleased that your OPC identified, and fixed the fault.I’ve had my 2023 S for a month and, after a few days use, unfortunately, I noticed that there is a knocking noise from the steering, or front suspension, that can be heard when driving slowly over a bumpy road.The same noise can be heard when turning the steering wheel from side to side with the car stopped, and engine running.My OPC had a look, but nothing obvious was found, but they did grease the steering column UJ, and bulkhead seal, which appeared to stop the noise, however, it returned after a few days, so they now suspect a faulty steering column may be the problem, and this will be investigated further next week","February 10, 2023"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"
andreas,"You hit the nail on the head!  The 2.0 litre has to rev like hell to produce any performance, plus the PDK starts hunting around the gears to try to optimise things.  It's not the relaxed power delivery we get in the larger engined versions.","May 16, 2023"
crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

It was even on the correct tyres - Michelin.Also no BOSE and I thought the quality was bad compared to our BOSE carOverall very disappointed and couldn’t wait to get rid of it.","May 17, 2023"

gammaray,"JayEmm on Cars put it best during his Macan T review I think - the base Macan is (to some people) a great “it’ll do” car. But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"
PJV997,"Agreed.I suspect 80%+, maybe 90%+, of medium size SUVs are running 2 litre four cylinder engines.  And for most owners they are perfectly happy with that.

BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier.

It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times!

pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise. I think the Macan works for 2 kids but any more than that I don’t think it’s a pleasant experience, or even practical if you need 3 boosters.","May 17, 2023"
James61,"I’ve got two kids ages 7 and 4, and it’s fine. Was a bit tight in the boot on long journeys when we first got it and we’re humping around buggy etc but manageable, and now we don’t have the baby stuff it’s plenty big enough.I also know a couple of other people with two kids and they are fine with it too.You can always have more space but the Macan always just about fits everything we need it to.James","May 17, 2023"
MacanGTSDes,"I’ve just purchased a 67 plate GTS very low mileage (26k) and have 3 kids, 12,18,21.Other family car is a BMW X3.Just sold an F82 M4 which my obviously only had 2 rear seats.Kids say the M4 had more rear leg room compared to the GTS.Didn’t buy it as a family car, just fancied a change after having about 12 different BMWs over the past 15 years.Only picked it up 2 weeks ago and a great car although I do miss the M4 and the extra performance.Regret not holding out for one with memory seats but other than that it’s very well spec’d.Enjoy !","May 17, 2023"
damo2576,"Hey,So I've spec'd pano roof as have always had just to brighten interior. On previous cars have been fixed (Range Rover) so never opened and don't think I will in the Macan either as never like the noise of sunroofs open.I've seen a few posts here about leaks and drain issues etc - so my question is better to just never open (which I'm happy to do) or better to open occasionally to keep things working properly?Not sure!","May 08, 2023"

aj13,"Not sure Simon as I didn't buy new.But I wouldn't say it's a perceived difference second hand...was defo there.What I did note was not that many macans were available without panroof, and when I was looking for a good 3-4 months, the non panroof ones seemed to be for sale for longer.Maybe that indicates that Porsche salesmen did there job well when people ordered new ones?","May 08, 2023"

Wing Commander,"I agree with regard to a pano roof (not that I’d ever spec one).With regard to the fuel filler cavity and the windscreen scuttle, I think it’s profiteering.  Neither would lead to water leaking to the interior of the car and both would be pretty blinkin’ obvious to the casual observer.","May 09, 2023"
2japs,"Yeah, get that.With the Macan there seems to be one or two extra bits of maintenance I never even considered with previous cars, the Pano roof drains and screen wash strength re the freezing issue. I asked at handover what strength the washer fluid was and didn’t seem to know, just shown the refill cap and recommended to get a jug with a spoutNever worried about anything with first Macan, although it required a oil service after 12 months, having said that I only had it 18months.","May 09, 2023"
Wing Commander,"Car asking for an oil change after a year is common, with ‘Audi’ engines.  My Panamera 4 wanted an oil change at 10k miles after only about 7 months!  (Mostly motorway miles.)The technical knowledge of the average SE is way below many of the folks on here!","May 09, 2023"
Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell. And re the drain from the fuel filler chamber, it’s purpose is to drain water and potentially fuel away safely and keep it away from bodywork and the rear tyre, both of which can be damaged by fuel.","May 09, 2023"
Wing Commander,"This is why you’re my technical/mechanical guru, Nick!But I still maintain that a drain blockage in either of those locations should be easily spotted (and subsequently rectified) by an observant owner.","May 09, 2023"
Scooby_Doo,"My last three MB's have had a pano roof and never had any problems with blocked drains,(cars always parked in the garage) is it just a Porsche problem. I'd always spec the pano roof purely for the brighter interior and the option to tilt the roof for some draught free ventilation. I have to admit that I very rarely opened the roof fully as it gets a bit blustery above about 55mph. I always had the shade open and rear seat passengers always commented on how light and spacious the rear felt with the pano roof.","May 09, 2023"
SAC1,"The panoramic roof in the Macan is great. Had one on both my Macans and use it tilted and fully open during sunny weather a lot.Rarely have the blind across as prefer the extra light that it gives.Never garaged, but never parked under trees.  Never had any problems with water ingress in 6 years combined use.My OPC did try and charge to service the GTS' roof at the 1st service, at 2yrs old, but I refused to pay for it.","May 09, 2023"
Kleynie,"Just do what I do and don’t park under trees and keep the drains clear with a Henry Hoover.Also, cut the drain ends off as they restrict the flow and cause the blockage.","May 09, 2023"

HertsMacan,"Totally agree Skyway. Its the principal and this dealership is taking liberties asking for more up front just to improve their cashflow. Absolutely no need for this practice unless OP has gone for some expensive or unpopular spec options which the dealer could lose out on when selling to someone else - even them, additional deposit should be proportionate to those risky options and only once the build has gone into lock down and can't be changed.Probably why this dealership has allocations or more likely, the SE are saying they can deliver in 6 months to get the inflated deposits in.","April 13, 2023"
HertsMacan,"BTW - Never ever pay any deposits by bank transfer only by credit card. Believe me, car dealerships can go under and be here today as normal and gone tomorrow.

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks. Unimpressed.If you look at the top of the engine under where the wipers are, you can often see the crystals formed all around the injector port.

RGS,"I have just discovered green mould similar to that you sometimes get on the rubber seal on the side windows, but this mould is within both the headlamp sealed units.It's not readily visible but it's on the rubber seal within the unit at the top where the headlamps follow the contour of the bonnet and almost certainly caused by occasionalcondensation that forms inside during certain weather conditions. I don't know whether this is normal and to be expected, but it doesn't look nice once you have seen it.I've sent a picture off to OPC for their comments.","April 11, 2023"

RGS,"Just an update, the green Algae turned out not to be within the sealed unit, but water/damp ingress in the rubber seal round the headlights under the bonnet. By easing the seal away from the glass I was able to get a plastic tool between the rubber and glass to clean the Algae off the seal successfully, but no doubt it will eventually return.","April 22, 2023"

andreas,"For many people, who don't have patios or decking to treat, buying 5 litres of something when they only need a tiny amount is wasteful.  The Polycell product is cheaper and convenient.Actually, the best stuff to use is Boracol 5RH, which includes a specific anti-mould chemical as well as an anti-algae chemical.  I have 20 years' experience of using it on the teak decks of my last sailboat, as well as on the canvas sprayhood of my current boat.  It's very good - a couple of applications annually keep the nasty stuff at bay.","April 22, 2023"
Neil1911,"You are a fund of information, invariably good!","April 23, 2023"
RGS,"Got a bit off topic here, I just wanted to say my Macan has PDLS plus headlights, if water or condensation can get between the rubber seal under the bonnet and the glass headlight on my car, then its quite possible others will be affected, although maybe less so if garaged. It's really just cosmetic and can be cleaned off, but gives the appearance of being within the unit. I only noticed it in bright sunlight and my car has lived outside since new for over 3 years which might explain.","April 23, 2023"
Neil1911,"It never affected me over 42 months and 40K miles outside but no doubt the light/shade, temperature and moisture condition will have an affect.","April 23, 2023"
LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

The economy suffers - 35 average in the SD to 28 mpg average with the GTS' 380 bhp 2.9 engine. Diesel is [currently] dearer than petrol, so the cost per mile difference isn't that great.  Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well. Depreciation being the single biggest cost in motoring.","May 17, 2023"

The reason I am thinking about another car is the £4000 + bill I am paying tomorrow for repairs to my SD which is now 7,5 years old with 54000 miles showing on odometer.  I have no knowledge of differences Gen 2 to Gen 3 so all I can say is looking at Autotrader I could get an S with very low mileage (eg less than 12000) and up to £60k, just hope I can find one with panoramic roof (and ideally a ""full size"" analogue clock on top of the dash).   What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates. Otherwise stick to GTS for Gen 2","May 01, 2023"

ghostwalker,"Can't say I've ever experienced anything like this on a brand new car. Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause. It could also be a bit of kit like the spare wheel being loose or something else not being secure.But anything moving around in the ""inner"" parts of the car that you can't access definitely needs looking into. I would take it to the OPC for inspection if that is definitely the case.","December 15, 2022"
Johnwin,Thanks -  the car is empty so definitely nothing coming from the interior. It’s going to the OPC tomorrow for an AWD software recall ( surprising given it’s only 3 weeks old) and I’ll ask them to take a look.,"December 15, 2022"

HertsMacan,"My S has gone in for a new door sensor (comfort access not working), rattle from passenger seat, and emergency braking function not working. They have given me a T as a loaner which I was really interested to compare, and I thought I would share my opinions on here. They are of course only my opinions.I absolutely love the steering wheel! Is this unique to the T? If its just an option on the S then i am gutted i didn't spec it, slightly smaller in diameter and thicker grip. Sounds stupid but it makes such a difference to driving the car. Wife don't like the patterned inlays but am not fussed either way, and this pattern continues on the steering wheel. I think this may be the T interior option.Car has sports crono and air suspension and to be honest, i can't feel any difference nor see the point of the dial on the steering wheel - but maybe that's just me. Glad i didn't spec those. The extended leather is lovely, but i knew that at the time and you have to stop somewhere. Loaner does not have bose, and i am not convinced my car sounds any better with bose. Dammit - should have dropped Bose and gone for steering wheel upgrade!!!!Now the elephant in the room. The big, massive difference is the engine. Don't get me wrong, put your foot down and it goes. Perfectly fast enough for its purpose - a family SUV, and will get you out of trouble when pulling away from a roundabout or getting out of a T junction quickly. However, there is a stark difference to the power delivery throughout the rev range and you do feel as if your thrashing it to get it going. I don't think i have ever needed to floor my S but this one you need to. The other unquestionable difference is the engine sound both on start up and when accelerating. The 6 cylinder sound is just sublime and i don't think, having had a 2.9 6 cylinder, i could ever go down to the 2 litre 4 pot.If you have never had the 6 cylinder and really only want the extra sporty features, i can see why you would go for the T . Made me realise that the GTS must be absolutely awesome!","May 16, 2023"

crockers,True. But specced the same it's not the price of the S. I admit the S is superior engine wise. But that's it. You pays your money........Maybe Porsche should have upped the power to 300 then you would have 265 300 380 440.,"May 16, 2023"

But a lot of people want a Porsche to feel more than just satisfied: they want it to feel genuinely special and more like a sporty Porsche. That is when the V6 option is worthwhile.Otherwise, for someone looking at a GLC300 or an X3 or Q5 with a 2.0L as well, the base and Macan T do the job perfectly (if not better because it handles amazingly and has endless customisation options over those rivals).","May 17, 2023"

Anybody else that has made a transition from a Touareg size car to a Macan with a family?Cheers.","December 05, 2021"
Wing Commander,"I think the Touareg is basically similar underneath (platform etc) to the Cayenne, in the same way the Macan was based on the Q5 platform.  So you are essentially downsizing from a Cayenne-sized car to its little brother.  Others on here have gone from Macan to Cayenne with a growing family.  I would at least check out a Cayenne...","December 05, 2021"

Col Lamb,"When our Grandkids were still in their car seats we did have them in our SD and with everything we needed the boot was full.Even now going on holiday to Scotland with just the two of us and our dog, the boot plus half the rear seat was full.So yes with two kids it will be cramped and if you are going to the airport to fly away on holiday then you will probably not have enough space to take all the luggage you want to take.So include roof bars, and a large roof box at minimum on a Macan or look at a Cayenne but even then you may need a roof box.","December 05, 2021"

Paul1970,"Ran a Macan for 3 years with 3 kids, 13,11 and 9 at the time I got it. Obviously it’s one extra kid than the OP but it was too small as the main family car, the boot was always stuffed full, leg room limited and they didn’t like going in it.Just took delivery of a Cayenne and now the kids feel like it’s sitting in first class, the leg room and width is enough for adults let alone kids and it has loads of boot space.If you’re using car seats and pushchairs it is going to be cramped as a main car in my opinion. And if you ever want an extra passenger in the back it isn’t going to be fun for them. However, the Cayenne is a much bigger car, the width in particular takes some getting used to. But I absolutely love it.","December 05, 2021"
davlewis,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, as I don’t have the Macan yet I can’t really comment, however they both fit in the back of my Wife’s mini with me driving (6ft) so they will be fine in the Macan, though I did have a few wobbles as the Macan in the rear is quite a bit smaller the my X3. But thought sod it I want a PorscheOn the other side I rarely keep a car for more than 18 months so if it doesn’t work I would probably either look at a Cayenne / Macan EV (maybe bigger inside) or back to an X3 but an X3M this time!","December 05, 2021"

Old Chimer,,"December 06, 2021"
BanZ,"In my opinion you will be absolutely fine with the Macan. I have a 2.5yr old and another one on the way and we will be using the Macan when we have both of them. It will be smaller than the VW Towrag as it’s based on the Q7 platform and Macan is Q5 platform so you’ve moved from suv class to medium/compact suv.We have a front facing car seat currently and there is plenty of space, we have had two large adults in the back along side it and for that it’s probably not ideal more than an hours drive. In terms of boot a buggy goes in easily we are using a stroller now so width wise it goes in and sits behind the seats in the boot, we have put our proper buggy in to test(iCandy) which is in two pieces and we can stack them or have the frame standing up if we wanted.It may come down to what you are used to though, we came from an Astra and as such we think there is loads of room and we feel comfortable if you are used to a much bigger car then you might be used to never filling the boot up. As with all these things it’s personal choice but the Macan will definitely work if you want it.","December 06, 2021"
MikeM,"Okay, I agree it all depends on what your used to. The worst aspect I have found is when the children are really small the rearward facing seats need to have the front seats too far forward, plus the I-Candy buggy and a few extra essentials plus bags are just a pain. Although, yes liveable and as soon as they are past that stage it’s fine. Still use my wife’s Land Rover for the task, it’s just easier. Not allowed to speed around with grandkids and dogs on boardtoo risky","December 06, 2021"
Pivot,"@azmj, you should be fine, depending how much stuff you want to carry around.Many young families fit into Golf-size vehicle.

ryderbridge,"I totally get your concerns about car space with two kiddos. I'm actually in a similar situation, contemplating a switch from a larger car to a Macan. It's always helpful to hear from other parents who've been through it.I recently came acrosshttps://fosterplus.org/circle-of-support, which has some great insights on raising kids. It might be worth checking out for some helpful tips.Regarding the Macan, I've heard that the rear space is pretty good, especially with front-facing seats. As for luggage space, it might be a bit tight, but hey, we're parents. We learn to pack light, right?By the way, air and comfort mode sounds like a game-changer for those nap times! Gotta love it when the little ones fall asleep peacefully.If anyone else has made the switch from a larger car to a Macan, I'd love to hear your experiences too.","May 17, 2023"
pstrat,"Perspective is key I think.I have 1 kid (now 2yrs old) so granted its not 2 kids but still.We had only a A3/Golf size car for the first 2 years of having her. Pram took up most of the boot, so we had to put shopping ontop and on the spare passenger seat. That did feel like a squeeze, specially going on holiday.Now we have the Macan it feels like a space ship in comparison and my thinking being if we have too much 'stuff' that it wont fit in the Macan boot then we've brought too much with us. Plus I also got a very small folding pram for those travel situations which saves a lot of room. Very worst case scenario I could get a roof box.Overall, I think the Macan is fine size wise. Just cut your cloth (luggage) accordingly","May 17, 2023"
azmj,"Just had our GTS over 6 months now.The boot actually is not an issue for us which was my initial concern.However the rear space is, with two car seats the middle seat space is non existent you are essentially buying a 2+2 if you have two child seats.Finally the legroom is limited at the back for the kids and can see this getting worse as they get older.A friend of mine once said the Macan is like a Golf on stilts and I am afraid purely size wise I have to agree.","May 17, 2023"
Paul1970,"I got a Macan GTS when my kids were 8, 12 and 15. They hated it and so we had to use a 7-seater Kia for family trips. Now I have a Cayenne they love it. The space is akin to a first class airplane cabin and the boot is sizeable as well. However it is a big jump up sizewise.

Nuclear Nick,"Not defending the costs Simon, but there is a potential route for water to enter the car from the windscreen scuttle. The ventilation plenum chamber inlet is there and if that fills with water and the pollen filter seals aren’t perfect water can get into the passenger footwell.

Local indy didn't want to know, and Porsche Belfast wouldn't even take a look for 4 weeks.

LetHimCook,"I can totally relate to your frustration with the green mould issue. It's a real pain to deal with, especially when it starts appearing in unexpected places like within the headlamp-sealed units. I recently noticed something similar in my own car, and it's definitely not a pleasant sight.I actually reached out to OPC and sent them a picture to get their input on the matter. While I'm waiting for their response, I've been doing some research on solutions to tackle mould. That's when I stumbled upon this company called Aiden's Property athttps://aidens.property. They specialize in mould removal and have received some positive reviews.I'm curious if anyone here has any experience with Aiden's Property or any other companies that deal with mould removal. I'd love to hear your feedback and recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.","May 15, 2023"
RGS,"Having discovered that what appeared to be algae inside the sealed headlight units was in fact on the outside rubber seal and able to be scraped off quite easily (interdental tooth brushes or plastic toothpicks are good) I found more at the rear on the light bar. For a while during the wet weather I had some water droplets at one end of the lightbar that refused to go. I showed it to the OPC and decided to monitor it for a while until the weather warmed up, but ready to order a new one under warranty if necessary. But on really close inspection I found some algae forming on the rubber seal at the end of the light bar where the droplets were. Same procedure by opening the boot lid I could scrape the stuff off quite easily from the rubber seal at the end of the bar, and bingo the droplets disappeared. They are formed by condensation inside the light bar and I guess the wet algae was blocking the vent and preventing the condensation to evaporate. The light bar still attracts a little condensation under certain weather conditions but that evaporates quite quickly. The car living outside on the drive does present some problems I guess and the proximity of trees and bushes doesn't help.","May 15, 2023"

At 13.30 after a fantastic Lunch all the drivers attended a short briefing for H&S instructions, this took about 15 mins and involved a slide show.We then teamed up with our instructor, my Gentian Blue S loan car was outside. Slightly different spec to mine, 20"" alloys, 18 way seats, sports exhaust, 72 plate.We started with a couple of siter laps on both circuits with myself driving. Then as he expertly taught me the quickest line through the corners/straights we got quicker and quicker. After this we tried the emergency stop a few times followed by 4 goes at Launch Control. Absolutely unbelievable performance, couldn't believe how quick the car was. Then we did the skid pan and then several attempts on the kicker plate wet track. He encouraged me to keep the car in a straight line even with  PCM turned off! Very enjoyable. We then did a few more quick laps and back to base for refreshments including afternoon tea!15 mins later we were in a Cayenne on the off road track with my Grandson in the back, Liam driving and me up front. Gob smacked at the Cayennes capability!Then he we were all back in the Macan S and my Grandson was up front, me in the back, Liam driving. Did all the things I had done including Launch Control and skid pan. Grandson was awestruck to say the lease. Finally Liam drove some hot laps and by God was he quick.

There was 7 large ring bound books that came in a box.But just as a cautionary note, these type of manuals are for the serious tech' guys, as they refer to procedures which are well beyond the DIY driver.

On-Track,In your original post you said the car was still under an extended warranty. If that is a Porsche warranty then going to an independent will be terminal. The effect on resale value with an eight year old car in no longer having a continuous Porsche service history is less easy to define but will not be positive. If you plan to keep the car until at least the end of the warranty then IMHO you should bite the bullet and pay up.If the climate control is working OK then you can skip the Air Con service but the brake fluid change is a must as it slowly deteriorates even if the car does not turn a wheel.,"May 04, 2023"

She said yes and brought it down - and then while I was waiting for the car I bought a fun coffee mug, and on mentioning my PCGB card, York gave me a further 10% on parts.

Also no AdBlue costs with petrol.  And as everyone will say ""it's a Porsche, so forget about mpg"".Like for like the petrol engine Macan will have a better future residual value as well.

What is the ""important option"" that is in the boot Col. Lamb ?

jean458,The diesel has a big torque and power is really good in stage 1.I think if you want to upgrade you should look for a GTS or Turbo.The £4000 bill should not make you want another car because it can happen on any Macan.It is very expensive indeed. I don't know what wire you're talking about but if you learn to do it by yourself it would cost only £400 for front brakes/pad + speed sensor.The diesel engine is very robust.

RGS,"Main difference between a Gen 2 Turbo and GTS is buttons on the centre console instead of black plastic, alcantara headlining is standard as is comfort entry and electric steering adjustment on the steering wheel. 18 way seats are standard with the 14 way a no cost option and with the 2.9 engine, performance is identical to the GTS.

RGS,"I was relating to a review on the ""New Turbo"" by Romans the international car dealer who remarked that it was possible to spec the car over £100 K, but in their opinion around 12K would be the sweet spot. When I mentioned poverty spec, I had in mind a Gen 2 Turbo in my local OPC that had barely nothing added and was priced accordingly. As you said, options are very subjective and entirely under control of the first purchaser, so if you are buying used it's a good idea to have a knowledge of the various specs you would want on the vehicle.","May 01, 2023"
Col Lamb,Depends upon what you want!The Turbo is more powerful and delivers its get up and go more like a GT tourer whereas the GTS engines delivery are more akin to Boy Racers.GTS more bling and sweet handling.Turbo more refined with more options as standard hence very little is needed to be added.GTS more likely to hold its value.Good luck making your choice,"May 01, 2023"
pmg,"I disagree with Col's comment about GTS v Turbo refinement. I agree his comments are correct for Gen 1 cars for which the turbo has greater capacity. However, the question was asked about Gen 2 cars for which the GTS and Turbo engines are the same block with the extra power being obtained by the state of tune with the turbo's power and torque curves spreading slightly higher up the rev range with little refinement difference if any.I would say go for a Gen 2 turbo over GTS if you regularly like using the top of the rev range and are happy with fuel bills that generates.

Are you sure you've not (or that another person hasn't) left/dropped any items in places around the car and forgotten about them? That could be one cause.

Voodoo Blue,"I’m not going to offer an opinion on spec as this is pretty subjective but would suggest you try to see and drive a few different cars to form an idea of what you want. The salesperson will almost certainly suggest some “essential “ options to help with the sale of the car once you’re done with it but it is up to you if you really want or need them.As far as discounts go, they’re not unheard of but being new to the brand and the shortage of new car availability I’d suggest that getting one would be very unlikely. But no harm trying even if it means getting a few freebie’s. I’m told the current waiting time is around 9 months for a new order so be prepared for that as well.Porsche finance isn’t the most competitive and there are other providers that will do a better deal so definitely worth shopping around to see what’s available.Other that that you might want to pop over to https://www.macanforums.co.uk.

notsomadmick,"I've had 6 Macans. 2 DS and 4 GTS. I've owned a lot of cars over the years. 15 of them Porsches. I drive fast when it is safe to do so. The Macan GTS - with PASM, PTV+, 20 inch Spyder wheels and 18-way seats is the most complete vehicle you can ever buy. It does more things in one package than any other car can. It's almost a sports car, it can take the dogs, the kids, and goes round corners in a way that defies belief - certainly for an SUV anyway. Don't bother with the sunroof - unless you need it. Full leather is nice to have if you can. Don't bother with air suspension, you loose feel. Don't waste your money on Bose. It's no better than the standard set up - and steals useful floor space in the boot. LEDs are nice to have, but not a deal breaker. The 3.0 DS in similar spec is still a great car. You don't really need a turbo version unless cash is of no concern. Dip you bread it's a buyers market at the moment. ","January 08, 2019"

If he really needs a versatile 4/5 seater, then he won't be disappointed - but its not a 911 or a Cayman.I've driven several variants, but not the latest 'facelift' model, and they are all good in different ways.

The DS also sounds pretty good with the sports exhaust, very good mid-range power delivery and will do a genuine 40 mpg.Nicest options are the sports seats (18 way), Air Suspension and PASM for the best ride/handling, I wouldn't go above 20"" wheels, panoramic roof is popular.

Tried everything from a Jag F-Type to an Evoque to a mix of Kia's, a couple of Audi's and Mercs and even a Tesla. She drove the Macan and didnt really say much.... didnt think too much about it.Next working day, sent me the details on the offer, package and dealer incentives etc... yep, she made her mind up on the spot and it matched with mine! While they get criticism for the array of buttons, which I thought she would hate, she ended up loving it. Not necessarily helped by test driving the new Evoque just beforehand, which had 100% touchscreens that just didnt work well. Pretty simple and easy to use, but in the sun the reflection was awful and you ended up not being able to see them! Buttons all the way (though I know its changing for the 2022 Macan).Had a Cayenne before which was really good, if expensive car to run. But the Macan really is a bigger hot hatch! Fast, nimble, easy to drive and suspiciously quick! Oh, and the ride is fantastic. We dont have the air suspension, but even without it, the ride is very good and its super quiet too. As mentioned by others, its a really good all-rounder. If you want to cruise quietly, it can do that. If you want to tackle a nice mountain road, it can do that too.... and practicality is good too.Criticisms? The updated infotainment is good and works well, BUT it can take a little longer to hook up for wireless CarPlay and doesnt like switching between phones, but thats small. Rear space isnt great either, so dont expect some roomy cavern on the inside. The seats are excellent, but you will want the 14 way ones, which are usually extra. If you have the tow accessory, the rear hatch hands-free opening doesnt work at all and for the US market, you dont get full open / close for the windows on the remote - its disabled for some damn reason! Even my low spec i3 has that!!! And its not an option that a Porsche dealer can turn on either. They arent allowed, even though its in the PIWIS system! Biggest criticism? Extras.... you will pay a lot for them, many of which are simply not worth the money... just take a look at the configurator at some of the personalization options, you can spend thousands on stuff you dont need!Cars sold in the US come with a 3 year warranty, 1 years servicing (get a second for free from my dealer), free Lo-Jack and I even managed to get a small discount before the car market went bonkers! Fully intend to keep the car for at least 3 years as it is fantastic. Unless I win some sort of lottery or have a windfall, this one is a keeper!Oh, and its currently at a bodyshop having a small dent / paint chip fixed - these things happen and I was prepared to just let it roll.

lornemalvo,"I test drove a base Macan last year and it was nice to drive, without a shadow of a doubt ( although I didn't like the protruding centre bulkhead that pushed my left foot into an unnatural position). I read a great deal about them and came to the conclusion that from an engineering point of view, the Macan is both brilliant and appalling. The interior quality is stunning. It just shouts quality and makes my (otherwise nice) Audi A4 interior look like a Lada. The feel of the drive is really nice, although the base engine was not that impressive, although probably fine in daily use.On the down side, I'm staggered that people accept the almost inevitable and extremely expensive mechanical issues that these cars seem to come with, at relatively low mileages. The Macan is not a new car, so why the engines and transfer boxes persist with these faults is beyond me. Either Porsche are unable or are unwilling to develop their product properly. So ownership, in my view, can only be for me while the car has an OPC warranty, which is a major expense on top of an expensive car to run. The final straw is the way prices of used cars have gone. Macans seem disproportionately affected so people are obviously buying into Porsche's schtick. Image driven? Perhaps they are helped by the fact that the competition is so damned mediocre?

I can just about get 30-32mpg from the GTS which has a de-tuned RS4 engine. I'd be curious to know if I got it mapped whether I'd get better fuel economy. However a Diesel Macan wasn't hugely better, which is why I made the swap.Curiously a Diesel Macan I had about 7 years ago (with the same engine as the Macan) used to do 42mpg+ with no issues.If you're really doing 17,000 in a single car though, for me good economy is mainly important for range - I couldn't be bothered with refilling every few days.

When I started thinking about a Macan GTS last year I was offered a test drive, only to turn up and be told they didn't have the GTS on site but I could have a go in the 2.0 model instead.Honestly, 20 mins in it very nearly made me forget the Macan entirely. Very quiet, gutless and didn't feel hugely different to my mum's Q3. It also seemed like it would be poor on fuel, but I didn't spend enough time in it to confirm.I've now had my GTS for a few months and in reality isn't quite as much of a sports car as the marketing would have you think, even with all the right options ticked. It definitely doesn't feel as fast as the 0-60 would have you believe either - I guess launch control is to blame for that. As a daily driver that I can fit a drum kit/guitar rig/camping stuff in the back of it's a decent package, but I certainly wouldn't be in a rush to sell a sports car for it!

A_K,"I’ve said this since the day I bought a Macan GTS - an absolute cracker of a car which I wish I could afford to have as the school run/family runaround alongside a 911.As it is I can’t afford to run such an expensive car (over £60k) in that guise. But, purchase price aside, there are very few other cars that are as all round wonderful as the Macan GTS as daily family car.And for what it’s worth I think the Macan absolutely trumps the ubiquitous RR Sport which in my opinion - and I’m sure this will ruffle feathers - is today almost exclusively driven by ‘new money’ types more keen to appear as if they are part of some exclusive set than they are about the car’s actual performance vs other similarly priced marques.The Macan is better in every way other than space.

The other factor that did it for me was that we drive to Croatia at least twice a year and the RRS is just spot on for that sort of thing, almost perfect frankly.

off_again,"Oso said:A clever argument, but even the most myopically badge-obsessed buyer now knows that the Macan is built on a platform Audi ditched years ago, that Porsche is nursing along until it’s allowed to rebadge the Q4.Ouch, but a little incorrect. Yes, the Macan and Q5 were built on the MLB platform, there differences are pretty dramatic. Only around 20% of the base chassis shares common parts and Porsche made significant changes from the engines (not so much now) to gearbox to 4WD system. And that’s before you get to the suspension setup, pickup points and additional structural parts that Porsche added. So yeah, it’s the same platform if that works for you.Audi did make a change and shifted to the MLB evo platform for later models, while Porsche stuck with the success that they had and further refined it. Yes, there are some “Porscheness” stuff they claim to have done - like the changed brake mechanism to “add more feel”, but they are very different cars, just happen to have some of the body pickup points that are very similar.But hey, don’t let details get in the way of a story.Now, if we want to dig in on some of weird stuff that Porsche did, that was bizarre and went wrong, that’s fine. The early V6 engines (absolutely NOT Audi engines) have oil leak issues that need an engine out to fix. Then there are the transfer box issues that can cost thousands to fix. Oh and there are reports of some engines going pop! Not the type of quality that you would expect for that price. Oddly the VW sourced 2.0T engine is the most reliable one, especially from the early models. Now they have switched to a derivative of the Audi 2.9 V6 in different states of tune which seems to be significantly more reliable and stout. Oh and they take to tuning very well. The very latest models have the 3.0 V6, but not sure if that’s a Porsche or Audi engine now. But still that 2.0T is still there. From what I am aware of, a small remap and it gets a lot peppier and removes hesitancy from it. But the question still remains, is there enough of a price difference or saving on MPG to justify not going to the V6? That is the tough question to answer. Oso said: ","November 13, 2021"
Cheib,Driven quite a few 2.0 Macan's as loan cars...we have a previous gen Macan Turbo PP and have also driven the old Macan Diesel. If your Macan is purely a means of transport then the 2.0 is fine but if you want to have any kind of fun or excitement then it is not for you...the old Diesel was a better drive because of the torque but the V6 engined cars are much nicer to drive and also sound better too.

No ta, not for me at least.Totally agree but it is a product of our time. With so many governments around the world forcing fuel economy and emissions regulations on cars, they really had to do something that got close to what the market was being forced to be. Is it ideal? Nah, but when you are still a niche manufacturer, you have to consider the wider market and have something that can sell in decent numbers. And that’s what it is all about - they have to sell cars, and with that they can continue to develop and manufacture interesting ones.And I did read in one of the most recent PCA magazines about the 2.0T sales numbers. Seems that most of them are sold in China! That’s the big market for them and hence will likely continue down this path for a while at least. That market is very brand aware and yes, a fair percentage of buyers there are getting it because of the badge. But it’s their choice and it is still only a niche product in such a vast market.Is it worth 50k? Probably not. You can easily spec one above a base S and at that point I absolutely would be going for the bigger engine. And it’s worth noting that the 2.0T isn’t that much more economical in real world situations. So a lot of the cost savings will be down to local tax and emissions regulations, and we are back to the global market conditions issue again. TyrannosauRoss Lex said: ","November 14, 2021"

I don't know why that is so hard to understand.Ah, but the internet has spoken - they arent allowed to sell anything other than very specific types of car that look a particular way.

If you want a speedy one, there are other options in the range. Not everyone wants or needs ballsout performance. For most users and applications, anything BUT the 2.0 is probably overkill.I don't think anyone looks at a Macan and thinks performance car, its really a designer handbag amongst small SUVs. And there is nothing wrong with that (if its your bag).Some may see Porsche doing this as sacrilege, but our relationship with cars is changing.Its not purely about performance, its about everything else..... Sound, feel etc.... That a 4 pot just can't give you in a big heavy ""supposed"" luxury car...Surely for city bound drivers the EV will feel a lot better than the four pot?

I wouldn't want one with this engine though. I was happy to pay £5k more new for the Mercedes GLC I have, because I wanted a 6 cylinder engine instead of a 4 cylinder. I'd do exactly the same if I was buying a Macan too.PH...engines matter!In reality it does not even cost you £5k more as i bet the 6 cyl model has a resale value at least several k higher than the 4 pot model, I'd guess you would make at least half of that 5k back if not more.I think these 2 litre models are not so much aimed for the UK market, like the 2 litre F Type it's pointed out in some countries there are large extra costs, mostly tax, for running bigger engines, some of the figures shocked me, and so in these markets the 2 litre makes much better sense. cerb4.5lee said: ","November 15, 2021"

If you really need that much extra space, get a Discovery! Funnily enough all the people I know who’ve had a new RRS have actually been some of the smallest people I know :-)ps: look for just-above average sized houses in the suburbs that have had gaudy, oversized, ‘mansion style’ gates installed.

I don’t think it’s a coincidence that both the gates and car are too big for purpose :-)Edited by A_K on Saturday 13th November 08:58Lol at the multiple stereotypes, top marks! FWIW and the sake of balance without the hackneyed cliches, I bought an RRS after testing three variants of the Macan; the diesel, the S and the GTS as well as an X3 M40i. In the end it simply came down to space, the RRS has more of it and was the one we chose and at no point do I feel as if I've lost out on anything. Of all three (or four) the GTS was the one for me and whilst it was more dynamic drive than the RRS - no real surprise there - the compromise on space was too much. Is the Macan a 'better' car? Of course it isn't, it's what it is to the driver and the RRS is no better or worse either.Oh, and I'm of average height, live in a small village, have no gates to my driveway and my RRS is nearly five years old. I also had a Discovery as a loaner and that was too big for our needs.

My 911 has to go as the kids are getting too big, and it's now painful to go anywhere with the family as all they do is bh and fight.Consequently we go everywhere in the wifes golf R.So I've ordered a macan turbo, and after driving different macans fairly extensively at the PEC and on road, I'd say the performance macans drive like slightly taller, slightly heavier hot hatches.They will never be like a sports car, but they're not wallowy old barges either. I tried most premium SUV's whilst deciding on what to drive between now and the kids buggering off, and I found RR's to be big, cumbersome trucks, the new Jag f pace to be competent but zero character, with a downmarket interior, and all the BM, Audis to be as disappointing as I expected.I found the Macan to be a hoot, as I could chuck it down an a road at bonkers speeds, and still do motorway cruises in quiet comfort. It'll never be a sports car, but in the same way that the wifes R is the best compromise of fun and practicality in the medium hatch segment, I find the macan turbo (or gts) to be the best growing family car compromise.

NAS90,"I'm surprised by all the negativity about the Macan; when I first saw it/ heard about it I was somewhat sceptical, but having driven all the petrol models on road and track, I'm very impressed with it. I think one issue is what you choose to compare it to, Porsche define all of their 4 door concepts as the first sports cars in their segment, critical part of that being 'in their segment'.The Macan is a mid size premium SUV and the competition in that segment is Q5, Evoque, Tiguan R, X3 and now the new Jaguar F Pace. Drive it in a comparative test against its competition and you will agree with Porsche's marketing speak. Whilst I have yet to drive the Jaguar, the Macan's gearbox, chassis, engine response, etc. leaves the rest miles behind in terms of sporty feel and driving precision, take it on track and you'll surprise several drivers of so called 'sports cars', the Macan S in Sports mode, using the manual paddles is a quick motor, the GTS and Turbo even more so.Someone earlier on said the Macan was rubbish off road, I'm afraid I'm going to disagree with that also, i've driven it in the desert, on the beach, in the mountains and on dedicated off road testing courses and whilst it is no Land Rover Defender, the offload mode makes it very capable in most offload situations, over rocks the way the PSM moves traction to the wheels that have grip is really clever. Offload you always have to remember that you have road tyres and vulnerable bumpers but driven properly the Macan will go most places 99.9% of owners will ever need it to.If however you compare it to a Cayman/ Boxster/ 911 on the road then of course it feels disappointing, it is a sporty mid sized SUV, not a sports car. If however you see the Macan as a practical car that covers most requirements of family and outdoor life with the ability to be driven hard on road when you are in the mood, then you'll not be disappointed, as someone else previously said i think, the GTS is the pick of the range.

EricE,"Orangecurry said:I was being semi-serious - is it just ground clearance?Lots of reasons. The extra height gives you better overview over the road and traffic. People generally feel safer in SUVs because they sit above most the ""regular traffic"". I'd like to note that most lethal accidents involve a rollover and SUVs have a much higher center of gravity but whatever.Longer suspension travel, larger tyres and higher car weight give you greater comfort over potholes and save you slowing down for speed bumps. Unless you opt for low profile tyres with big rims.Many people look down on estates. I never understood that but assume that is because so many company cars are estates. SUVs are estates minus the whole ""sensible""/""practical"" image that people seem to hate so much.The higher entry position makes them easier to get in and out of. That's a major point for older or obese people. Both demographics are growing rapidly.Many people in my area want AWD for winter. Normal cars/estates often only offer AWD in combination larger engine which bumps the price up to where a normal AWD car isn't much cheaper than the corresponding SUV variant. At that point they just go with the SUV because of the aforementioned reasons. Orangecurry said: ","July 09, 2016"

First impressions are much better in all of the areas of deficit of the Macan. If anyone asked me what porsche sub to buy, I could only recommend the cayenne which was great.This speaks volumes .

There are lots of features of cars that only become apparent on ownership - a decent example being how long it takes for the macan to engage reverse. That 1 or 2 second opause might not sound a lot, but, it is when you are in a busy road trying to reverse park. Re the macan / fpace few vs thousands. Nonsense. The F pace is only just hitting UK roads. Certainly though, the cost of ownership of the macan over 2 years was very reasonable with residuals quite strong. I think the fpace interior quality perceptions are quite spec specific. I thought that too when I saw a few at events. Pleased with how ours has turned out however. No quality issues at all.By the way we made a deliberate choice to revert to petrol, as the diesel / emmissions backlash continues to roll and it wont be long til we get the introduction of penalty charges for London's CC zone for diesel cars. langlord said: ","September 28, 2016"

The dealer told me to go out and screw the st out of the Macan. (US dealers have a different attitude to UK). As I joined the highway there was a new 911 Turbo and an older M3. We all went for it. The 911 was clearly the fastest by a long way. But, the Macan did surprise me.The thing is, I love my car for how it drives at normal speeds and not at the limit.

IJB1959,"Reading through the posts here I really cannot understand some of the Macan GTS criticisms. If you don't like something or think it's too expensive, option it out or go for a lesser model instead. Porsche offer something for nearly everybody, so if it's too small buy a Cayenne, hate the GTS grill buy a S, hate the coloured vents? then don't option it. You are after all buying into a driver/owner focused brand rather than an all round practical family SUV. I have test driven the F-Pace, Stelvio, RSQ5, X3M, and other comparables and NOTHING comes even close to the V6 S & GTS when all is considered. The residuals are fantastic, and if you are lucky enough to purchase one (the wait is <>12 months) the car is generally worth more than you paid for it when delivered. A friend purchased a reasonably specked 2021 Macan Turbo and was offered 10k more than he paid for it by the dealership on collection day......he refused it BTW. If you do any research or online reviews on the Macan model you would be very hard pressed to find anything particularly negative whichever model you choose, although most say the Macan S is the 'sweet spot' model to purchase.

Macan downsides are the interior materials (you need to option it up) and space which both a class below what the Cayenne offers (and the electric steering wich has a strange feel as all of these systems). It is the only SUV I'd ever consider.ETA: This is all based on driving a Macan Turbo and a Cayenne SEdited by Dr S on Tuesday 15th March 10:56 Edited by Dr S on Tuesday 15th March 10:56 ","March 15, 2016"

Geneve,"I have had a Cayenne 3.0d for 5 years - family duties and long-haul trips - and it's been superb.Currently have a high spec Macan Diesel 'S' on loan, so it's an interesting comparison.I wouldn't say it's that much smaller. Yes, the Cayenne looks and feels bigger next to it, but the Macan is still a practical size for most purposes.My first impressions are that it is much more car-like and sportier to drive, with superior performance, handling and economy. Ride feels very good, but this one has 21"" wheels on Pirelli P-Zeros and, despite Air & PASM, feels a touch fidgety on some UK roads. From Cayenne experience, I think 20"" on 'all seasons' would give a more relaxed ride.Inevitably, the big consideration is the options list. You can create a mighty impressive vehicle, but £20ks of options is easily consumed.One point; spoke to a chap at the OPC and he said the 'petrol' and 'diesel' Macans do feel like very different cars. My preference for this type of vehicle would normally be 'diesel', but anyone compared both? ","March 15, 2016"

Malo,My wife had a Macan DS which she thought was a nice car - She now has an X5 M40d which she likes much more than the Macan. (I do also - Tech in the X5 is years ahead of the Macan). ,"March 15, 2016"
Bernardino,"I was loaned a nicely specced 2ltr version by my local OPC for a few days while my 997 was having some work done and I was very impressed. Managed to fit 2 adults in the back and 2 dogs in the boot easily. Even though I wouldn't buy this version the 2 ltr engine coped very well for the size of the car, only a tiny bit of lag but was comfortable on a long motorway run.Have also driven the turbo version which would be the one to go for if I was choosing, it's comfortable and quiet when it needs to be but for that type of the car the engine is something else.Have had the latest Cayenne on loan too, believe it was the 3.0d v6, was suprised at how nimble it felt given the size of it. It does feel so much more bigger than the Macan and I actually prefered the interior of the Macan, maybe because it felt more enclosed ","March 15, 2016"

bompey,"I have a petrol Turbo which will be 2 years old in July and I love it. I will be getting Macan 2 in July which is a GTS.It depends on your needs but as I only have 1 teenager so it makes sense for me. The cayenne is too big, 911 or cayman too small so this does the job perfectly. We recently tried a Cayenne and my wife didn't like it compared to the macan. The DSG gearbox is superb and makes it a great all round car. Try one! ","March 15, 2016"
