Gumpclipper,"Good morning all,I am looking at buying my first Porsche.Is there any advice you would give for essential Macan S options?I am also looking to potentially use Porsche finance, reading some of the older posts there seems to be limited to zero negotiation on rates and discounts. Has anyone any recent experience? Will probably be using Porsche Stockport.Any advice is appreciated.Thanks! ","October 10, 2021"
Voodoo Blue,"I’m not going to offer an opinion on spec as this is pretty subjective but would suggest you try to see and drive a few different cars to form an idea of what you want. The salesperson will almost certainly suggest some “essential “ options to help with the sale of the car once you’re done with it but it is up to you if you really want or need them.As far as discounts go, they’re not unheard of but being new to the brand and the shortage of new car availability I’d suggest that getting one would be very unlikely. But no harm trying even if it means getting a few freebie’s. I’m told the current waiting time is around 9 months for a new order so be prepared for that as well.Porsche finance isn’t the most competitive and there are other providers that will do a better deal so definitely worth shopping around to see what’s available.Other that that you might want to pop over to https://www.macanforums.co.uk. They are a very knowledgeable and friendly bunch who discuss this very topic on a regular basis so will probably prove quite helpful in your quest. ","October 10, 2021"

neilf,"My tip would be to get your name on the deposit list at an OPC ASAP. That way you’ll be in the queue while you make a decision.My Dad put a deposit on a Macan S in June, still hasn’t had an allocation. Current guesstimate for delivery is Q1 2022. Chatting with same OPC this week, said they are telling all new order requests (all Porsche models, not just Macan) that earliest delivery will be Q4 2022 or most likely Q1 2023.

Cheib,Link appears to be broken!If he’s looking at a Diesel read up on DPF issues...apparently not suitable for frequent short journeys because filter doesn’t get up to temp.I’ve got a Turbo PP which I love.

notsomadmick,"I've had 6 Macans. 2 DS and 4 GTS. I've owned a lot of cars over the years. 15 of them Porsches. I drive fast when it is safe to do so. The Macan GTS - with PASM, PTV+, 20 inch Spyder wheels and 18-way seats is the most complete vehicle you can ever buy. It does more things in one package than any other car can. It's almost a sports car, it can take the dogs, the kids, and goes round corners in a way that defies belief - certainly for an SUV anyway. Don't bother with the sunroof - unless you need it. Full leather is nice to have if you can. Don't bother with air suspension, you loose feel. Don't waste your money on Bose. It's no better than the standard set up - and steals useful floor space in the boot. LEDs are nice to have, but not a deal breaker. The 3.0 DS in similar spec is still a great car. You don't really need a turbo version unless cash is of no concern. Dip you bread it's a buyers market at the moment. ","January 08, 2019"

Koln-RS,"Whilst the Macan is not a true Porsche sports car, it is hard to fault as luxury, sporting SUV. If he really needs a versatile 4/5 seater, then he won't be disappointed - but its not a 911 or a Cayman.I've driven several variants, but not the latest 'facelift' model, and they are all good in different ways. The GTS sounds lovely, but quite thirsty. The DS also sounds pretty good with the sports exhaust, very good mid-range power delivery and will do a genuine 40 mpg.Nicest options are the sports seats (18 way), Air Suspension and PASM for the best ride/handling, I wouldn't go above 20"" wheels, panoramic roof is popular.

HM-2,"A GTS or Turbo on 19"" wheels is a pretty perfect single car all rounder in the UK but as a potential buyer (as I've considered the Macan as a replacement for my 140i) the residuals are hard to stomach. £40k for a 5 year old GTS with 70k on the clock puts you in a lot of equally competent newer performance cars of similar utility, or a range of similarly aged but somewhat more bonkers options that are still daily usable.

off_again,"Bought a 2021 Macan S in March! I knew what I was looking for and it was on the shortlist but allowed my wife to test drive a whole bunch of cars to see what she wanted. Tried everything from a Jag F-Type to an Evoque to a mix of Kia's, a couple of Audi's and Mercs and even a Tesla. She drove the Macan and didnt really say much.... didnt think too much about it.Next working day, sent me the details on the offer, package and dealer incentives etc... yep, she made her mind up on the spot and it matched with mine! While they get criticism for the array of buttons, which I thought she would hate, she ended up loving it. Not necessarily helped by test driving the new Evoque just beforehand, which had 100% touchscreens that just didnt work well. Pretty simple and easy to use, but in the sun the reflection was awful and you ended up not being able to see them! Buttons all the way (though I know its changing for the 2022 Macan).Had a Cayenne before which was really good, if expensive car to run. But the Macan really is a bigger hot hatch! Fast, nimble, easy to drive and suspiciously quick! Oh, and the ride is fantastic. We dont have the air suspension, but even without it, the ride is very good and its super quiet too. As mentioned by others, its a really good all-rounder. If you want to cruise quietly, it can do that. If you want to tackle a nice mountain road, it can do that too.... and practicality is good too.Criticisms? The updated infotainment is good and works well, BUT it can take a little longer to hook up for wireless CarPlay and doesnt like switching between phones, but thats small. Rear space isnt great either, so dont expect some roomy cavern on the inside. The seats are excellent, but you will want the 14 way ones, which are usually extra. If you have the tow accessory, the rear hatch hands-free opening doesnt work at all and for the US market, you dont get full open / close for the windows on the remote - its disabled for some damn reason! Even my low spec i3 has that!!! And its not an option that a Porsche dealer can turn on either. They arent allowed, even though its in the PIWIS system! Biggest criticism? Extras.... you will pay a lot for them, many of which are simply not worth the money... just take a look at the configurator at some of the personalization options, you can spend thousands on stuff you dont need!Cars sold in the US come with a 3 year warranty, 1 years servicing (get a second for free from my dealer), free Lo-Jack and I even managed to get a small discount before the car market went bonkers! Fully intend to keep the car for at least 3 years as it is fantastic. Unless I win some sort of lottery or have a windfall, this one is a keeper!Oh, and its currently at a bodyshop having a small dent / paint chip fixed - these things happen and I was prepared to just let it roll. But no, the wife wanted it perfect - I think she has fallen for it! ","July 28, 2021"

lornemalvo,"I test drove a base Macan last year and it was nice to drive, without a shadow of a doubt ( although I didn't like the protruding centre bulkhead that pushed my left foot into an unnatural position). I read a great deal about them and came to the conclusion that from an engineering point of view, the Macan is both brilliant and appalling. The interior quality is stunning. It just shouts quality and makes my (otherwise nice) Audi A4 interior look like a Lada. The feel of the drive is really nice, although the base engine was not that impressive, although probably fine in daily use.On the down side, I'm staggered that people accept the almost inevitable and extremely expensive mechanical issues that these cars seem to come with, at relatively low mileages. The Macan is not a new car, so why the engines and transfer boxes persist with these faults is beyond me. Either Porsche are unable or are unwilling to develop their product properly. So ownership, in my view, can only be for me while the car has an OPC warranty, which is a major expense on top of an expensive car to run. The final straw is the way prices of used cars have gone. Macans seem disproportionately affected so people are obviously buying into Porsche's schtick. Image driven? Perhaps they are helped by the fact that the competition is so damned mediocre?

When I started thinking about a Macan GTS last year I was offered a test drive, only to turn up and be told they didn't have the GTS on site but I could have a go in the 2.0 model instead.Honestly, 20 mins in it very nearly made me forget the Macan entirely. Very quiet, gutless and didn't feel hugely different to my mum's Q3. It also seemed like it would be poor on fuel, but I didn't spend enough time in it to confirm.I've now had my GTS for a few months and in reality isn't quite as much of a sports car as the marketing would have you think, even with all the right options ticked. It definitely doesn't feel as fast as the 0-60 would have you believe either - I guess launch control is to blame for that. As a daily driver that I can fit a drum kit/guitar rig/camping stuff in the back of it's a decent package, but I certainly wouldn't be in a rush to sell a sports car for it!

It's been very well set up to allow anyone of any ability to have a go in the cars and to do things they might not have experienced previously - launch control, emergency stop, skid pan etc.Their handling circuits are marked out like normal roads, so if, say, you bring your partner that's never done any sort of track driving before they can pootle round as if it was a twisty country road whilst if you're confident you can go a bit quicker and take the lines through the corners. The circuits are also fairly tight so you're never getting to huge speeds and certainly not round the corners.It's super useful if you're not sure how to spec your car yet, I did it in a manual GT4 which made me realise the PDK would be the better option for when I eventually get to spec mine.

But, purchase price aside, there are very few other cars that are as all round wonderful as the Macan GTS as daily family car.And for what it’s worth I think the Macan absolutely trumps the ubiquitous RR Sport which in my opinion - and I’m sure this will ruffle feathers - is today almost exclusively driven by ‘new money’ types more keen to appear as if they are part of some exclusive set than they are about the car’s actual performance vs other similarly priced marques.The Macan is better in every way other than space.

We had a Porsche driving day last week as a ‘gift’ from Porsche, this was great fun but the instructor spent some time showing her how to operate the reversing camera etc, the high speed manoeuvres were lost on her……I personally think it is a superb car, and realistically priced.In summary, would be an utter waste of icebergs to provide her with a V6 and I suspect that is much the same for 75% of 2.0 sales.Wow.

off_again,"Oso said:A clever argument, but even the most myopically badge-obsessed buyer now knows that the Macan is built on a platform Audi ditched years ago, that Porsche is nursing along until it’s allowed to rebadge the Q4.Ouch, but a little incorrect. Yes, the Macan and Q5 were built on the MLB platform, there differences are pretty dramatic. Only around 20% of the base chassis shares common parts and Porsche made significant changes from the engines (not so much now) to gearbox to 4WD system. And that’s before you get to the suspension setup, pickup points and additional structural parts that Porsche added. So yeah, it’s the same platform if that works for you.Audi did make a change and shifted to the MLB evo platform for later models, while Porsche stuck with the success that they had and further refined it. Yes, there are some “Porscheness” stuff they claim to have done - like the changed brake mechanism to “add more feel”, but they are very different cars, just happen to have some of the body pickup points that are very similar.But hey, don’t let details get in the way of a story.Now, if we want to dig in on some of weird stuff that Porsche did, that was bizarre and went wrong, that’s fine. The early V6 engines (absolutely NOT Audi engines) have oil leak issues that need an engine out to fix. Then there are the transfer box issues that can cost thousands to fix. Oh and there are reports of some engines going pop! Not the type of quality that you would expect for that price. Oddly the VW sourced 2.0T engine is the most reliable one, especially from the early models. Now they have switched to a derivative of the Audi 2.9 V6 in different states of tune which seems to be significantly more reliable and stout. Oh and they take to tuning very well. The very latest models have the 3.0 V6, but not sure if that’s a Porsche or Audi engine now. But still that 2.0T is still there. From what I am aware of, a small remap and it gets a lot peppier and removes hesitancy from it. But the question still remains, is there enough of a price difference or saving on MPG to justify not going to the V6? That is the tough question to answer. Oso said: ","November 13, 2021"

If your Macan is purely a means of transport then the 2.0 is fine but if you want to have any kind of fun or excitement then it is not for you...the old Diesel was a better drive because of the torque but the V6 engined cars are much nicer to drive and also sound better too.

No ta, not for me at least.Totally agree but it is a product of our time. With so many governments around the world forcing fuel economy and emissions regulations on cars, they really had to do something that got close to what the market was being forced to be. Is it ideal? Nah, but when you are still a niche manufacturer, you have to consider the wider market and have something that can sell in decent numbers. And that’s what it is all about - they have to sell cars, and with that they can continue to develop and manufacture interesting ones.And I did read in one of the most recent PCA magazines about the 2.0T sales numbers. Seems that most of them are sold in China! That’s the big market for them and hence will likely continue down this path for a while at least. That market is very brand aware and yes, a fair percentage of buyers there are getting it because of the badge. But it’s their choice and it is still only a niche product in such a vast market.Is it worth 50k? Probably not. You can easily spec one above a base S and at that point I absolutely would be going for the bigger engine. And it’s worth noting that the 2.0T isn’t that much more economical in real world situations.

I'd do exactly the same if I was buying a Macan too.PH...engines matter!In reality it does not even cost you £5k more as i bet the 6 cyl model has a resale value at least several k higher than the 4 pot model, I'd guess you would make at least half of that 5k back if not more.I think these 2 litre models are not so much aimed for the UK market, like the 2 litre F Type it's pointed out in some countries there are large extra costs, mostly tax, for running bigger engines, some of the figures shocked me, and so in these markets the 2 litre makes much better sense. cerb4.5lee said: ","November 15, 2021"

If you really need that much extra space, get a Discovery! Funnily enough all the people I know who’ve had a new RRS have actually been some of the smallest people I know :-)ps: look for just-above average sized houses in the suburbs that have had gaudy, oversized, ‘mansion style’ gates installed. There’s almost always a newish RR sport parked in the driveway. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that both the gates and car are too big for purpose :-)Edited by A_K on Saturday 13th November 08:58Lol at the multiple stereotypes, top marks! FWIW and the sake of balance without the hackneyed cliches, I bought an RRS after testing three variants of the Macan; the diesel, the S and the GTS as well as an X3 M40i. In the end it simply came down to space, the RRS has more of it and was the one we chose and at no point do I feel as if I've lost out on anything. Of all three (or four) the GTS was the one for me and whilst it was more dynamic drive than the RRS - no real surprise there - the compromise on space was too much. Is the Macan a 'better' car? Of course it isn't, it's what it is to the driver and the RRS is no better or worse either.Oh, and I'm of average height, live in a small village, have no gates to my driveway and my RRS is nearly five years old. I also had a Discovery as a loaner and that was too big for our needs.

Avalyn,"I had my Boxster S 987.2 in for it's annual MOT yesterday. I requested a Macan for a courtesy car as it's on my (OK, very long and ever changing) list of replacements as my next car. My wife wants to downsize (she has a Q5) after her smelly mutt heads off to the park in the sky (hopefully not too long) and this may mean I require a car that will seat 4 adults and occasionally luggage too. I'm not 100% sold of SUV's but the Macan was one I was considering.When I arrived at the dealership I can see the Macan parked up and waiting for me. I'm delighted that it's a petrol S. It looks the nuts. White, black 21"" Sport classic alloys, and once I'm inside I see it's pretty much optioned out. Not a single blank button. I am looking forward to a day with this.Ok, lets start her up. Oh, where's the exhaust note? A few revs maybe, errrm no, very quiet. Ah, lets hit the PSE button. Nope. Check I've pressed the right button, hmmm, let's try putting it in Sport+, looks like the PSE is on - what a disappointment. Maybe it'll sound better on the move.Ok, into D and off we go. Awe man, what's going on with the steering. It's light and a bit gloopy. Head onto the dual carriageway and give it some beans. Yes we go faster, but there's no drama, and it doesn't feel as quick as I had hoped. On to some B-roads, excellent handling, PDK in Sport+ is always in the correct gear, and we make some really quick progress. It does go where I point it, but I don't like the steering feel, and the engine is a bit anodyne. More a propulsion device really. It takes me a while to get used to the brakes around town, they bite with such a small pressure on the pedal and I don't make smooth progress.So where does that leave me. I'm impressed by the looks inside and out. It's beautifully finished (although the gear lever seems much less solid in it's motion than mine) but it's lacking character. Of course I was expecting a different drive than my Boxster, but I was still expecting a Porsche-ness to it. No complaints about how it handles for such a big car, also no complaints about the drivetrain, efficient, whip crack shifts and it does go well.In my opinion it's gone a bit Audi and if that's the case I need to go try an SQ5 and see how it compares. Maybe I'm just not an SUV person and will stick to my other ideas of getting a big saloon/estate.

POORCARDEALER,"Avalyn said:I had my Boxster S 987.2 in for it's annual MOT yesterday. I requested a Macan for a courtesy car as it's on my (OK, very long and ever changing) list of replacements as my next car. My wife wants to downsize (she has a Q5) after her smelly mutt heads off to the park in the sky (hopefully not too long) and this may mean I require a car that will seat 4 adults and occasionally luggage too. I'm not 100% sold of SUV's but the Macan was one I was considering.When I arrived at the dealership I can see the Macan parked up and waiting for me. I'm delighted that it's a petrol S. It looks the nuts. White, black 21"" Sport classic alloys, and once I'm inside I see it's pretty much optioned out. Not a single blank button. I am looking forward to a day with this.Ok, lets start her up. Oh, where's the exhaust note? A few revs maybe, errrm no, very quiet. Ah, lets hit the PSE button. Nope. Check I've pressed the right button, hmmm, let's try putting it in Sport+, looks like the PSE is on - what a disappointment. Maybe it'll sound better on the move.Ok, into D and off we go. Awe man, what's going on with the steering. It's light and a bit gloopy. Head onto the dual carriageway and give it some beans. Yes we go faster, but there's no drama, and it doesn't feel as quick as I had hoped. On to some B-roads, excellent handling, PDK in Sport+ is always in the correct gear, and we make some really quick progress. It does go where I point it, but I don't like the steering feel, and the engine is a bit anodyne. More a propulsion device really. It takes me a while to get used to the brakes around town, they bite with such a small pressure on the pedal and I don't make smooth progress.So where does that leave me. I'm impressed by the looks inside and out. It's beautifully finished (although the gear lever seems much less solid in it's motion than mine) but it's lacking character. Of course I was expecting a different drive than my Boxster, but I was still expecting a Porsche-ness to it. No complaints about how it handles for such a big car, also no complaints about the drivetrain, efficient, whip crack shifts and it does go well.In my opinion it's gone a bit Audi and if that's the case I need to go try an SQ5 and see how it compares. Maybe I'm just not an SUV person and will stick to my other ideas of getting a big saloon/estate. I'd be interested to see if the Panamera drives like the Macan.At the start of the day, I had expected to be asking the dealer how much it would cost me to change my car, at the end of the day I was glad to be back in my 5 year old Boxster ..Bought wifey a Cayenne diesel recently as a daily, she has had many Porsches over the years...she echos your thoughts reference it could be a Merc/Audi/whatever and in fact wants to go back to a Range Rover vogue as the Porsche lacks ""specialness""....from my point of view its quiet, stable, goes well and will be reliable.Panamera is well worth a drive.

My 911 has to go as the kids are getting too big, and it's now painful to go anywhere with the family as all they do is bh and fight.Consequently we go everywhere in the wifes golf R.So I've ordered a macan turbo, and after driving different macans fairly extensively at the PEC and on road, I'd say the performance macans drive like slightly taller, slightly heavier hot hatches.They will never be like a sports car, but they're not wallowy old barges either. I tried most premium SUV's whilst deciding on what to drive between now and the kids buggering off, and I found RR's to be big, cumbersome trucks, the new Jag f pace to be competent but zero character, with a downmarket interior, and all the BM, Audis to be as disappointing as I expected.I found the Macan to be a hoot, as I could chuck it down an a road at bonkers speeds, and still do motorway cruises in quiet comfort. It'll never be a sports car, but in the same way that the wifes R is the best compromise of fun and practicality in the medium hatch segment, I find the macan turbo (or gts) to be the best growing family car compromise.

NAS90,"I'm surprised by all the negativity about the Macan; when I first saw it/ heard about it I was somewhat sceptical, but having driven all the petrol models on road and track, I'm very impressed with it. I think one issue is what you choose to compare it to, Porsche define all of their 4 door concepts as the first sports cars in their segment, critical part of that being 'in their segment'.The Macan is a mid size premium SUV and the competition in that segment is Q5, Evoque, Tiguan R, X3 and now the new Jaguar F Pace. Drive it in a comparative test against its competition and you will agree with Porsche's marketing speak. Whilst I have yet to drive the Jaguar, the Macan's gearbox, chassis, engine response, etc. leaves the rest miles behind in terms of sporty feel and driving precision, take it on track and you'll surprise several drivers of so called 'sports cars', the Macan S in Sports mode, using the manual paddles is a quick motor, the GTS and Turbo even more so.Someone earlier on said the Macan was rubbish off road, I'm afraid I'm going to disagree with that also, i've driven it in the desert, on the beach, in the mountains and on dedicated off road testing courses and whilst it is no Land Rover Defender, the offload mode makes it very capable in most offload situations, over rocks the way the PSM moves traction to the wheels that have grip is really clever. Offload you always have to remember that you have road tyres and vulnerable bumpers but driven properly the Macan will go most places 99.9% of owners will ever need it to.If however you compare it to a Cayman/ Boxster/ 911 on the road then of course it feels disappointing, it is a sporty mid sized SUV, not a sports car. If however you see the Macan as a practical car that covers most requirements of family and outdoor life with the ability to be driven hard on road when you are in the mood, then you'll not be disappointed, as someone else previously said i think, the GTS is the pick of the range.

EricE,"Orangecurry said:I was being semi-serious - is it just ground clearance?Lots of reasons. The extra height gives you better overview over the road and traffic. People generally feel safer in SUVs because they sit above most the ""regular traffic"". I'd like to note that most lethal accidents involve a rollover and SUVs have a much higher center of gravity but whatever.Longer suspension travel, larger tyres and higher car weight give you greater comfort over potholes and save you slowing down for speed bumps. Unless you opt for low profile tyres with big rims.Many people look down on estates. I never understood that but assume that is because so many company cars are estates. SUVs are estates minus the whole ""sensible""/""practical"" image that people seem to hate so much.The higher entry position makes them easier to get in and out of. That's a major point for older or obese people. Both demographics are growing rapidly.Many people in my area want AWD for winter. Normal cars/estates often only offer AWD in combination larger engine which bumps the price up to where a normal AWD car isn't much cheaper than the corresponding SUV variant. At that point they just go with the SUV because of the aforementioned reasons. Orangecurry said: ","July 09, 2016"

What is it for?Its like its compromised on everything and doesnt do anything well.I wouldnt pay £18k for one.It is compromised.In comparison: the Cayenne (too big and truck like), the X5 (too cold/utilitarian, vertical at the windscreen, too big for central London), GLE (rubbish to drive and like looking through a letterbox), GLC (quite nice and a cheaper alternative), Audi (no thanks), XC60 (rubbish drivetrain), RR (expensive, dubious reliability beyond the basic warranty period, and depreciates fast)...The Macan, however, in comparison to other SUVs: amazing to drive, fast, superlative build quality, very comfortable interior at the front, enough room in the rear for our needs, quiet, good visibility through the front and past A-pillars, and exceptional residuals. And the Macan feels like a quality/premium product which it is- even though it is compact. So all round, it feels the best product for us. Second place goes to the Merc GLC - a very nice product, at a commensurate lower price point.The Macan isn't for everyone. Like most other SUVs aren't either. mollytherocker said: ","September 20, 2016"
langlord,"Bernardino - have you actually spec'd up you diesel S against the GTS.Personally I found the cost very similar especially when residuals come into play as effectively the GTS comes as standard with quite a bit more over the Diesel S, obviously one of the more costly items being the sport design kit, which if you don't spec will make the diesel S cheaper.For me though the small difference in cost when you get the following on top that cant be specified:Brakes from the turbo.Improved suspension.The engine! which also has a big impact on the PES.Potential to have the GTS interior - although costly, for effectively contrast stitching, different seat belts and dials.I think there are some GTS build slots available as well from what I have heard in the not to distant future.

There are lots of features of cars that only become apparent on ownership - a decent example being how long it takes for the macan to engage reverse. That 1 or 2 second opause might not sound a lot, but, it is when you are in a busy road trying to reverse park. Re the macan / fpace few vs thousands. Nonsense. The F pace is only just hitting UK roads. Certainly though, the cost of ownership of the macan over 2 years was very reasonable with residuals quite strong. I think the fpace interior quality perceptions are quite spec specific. I thought that too when I saw a few at events. Pleased with how ours has turned out however. No quality issues at all.By the way we made a deliberate choice to revert to petrol, as the diesel / emmissions backlash continues to roll and it wont be long til we get the introduction of penalty charges for London's CC zone for diesel cars. langlord said: ","September 28, 2016"

Rectangular shapes should not be allowed on cars. They’ve done it to the 992 and the Cayenne as well. It’s this stupid drive to homogenise the looks of all the models.

At 1-3k rpm it feels like a small engine in a big car.I had a 2016 macan GTS for 2 weeks while some warranty work was taken care of on my Cayenne GTS. When I checked in with the dealer, my car wasn’t ready. They asked how I liked the Macan. I said I preferred the Cayenne because of the engine characteristics. Lots of power all the time. The dealer told me to go out and screw the st out of the Macan. (US dealers have a different attitude to UK). As I joined the highway there was a new 911 Turbo and an older M3. We all went for it. The 911 was clearly the fastest by a long way. But, the Macan did surprise me.The thing is, I love my car for how it drives at normal speeds and not at the limit.

I have test driven the F-Pace, Stelvio, RSQ5, X3M, and other comparables and NOTHING comes even close to the V6 S & GTS when all is considered. The residuals are fantastic, and if you are lucky enough to purchase one (the wait is <>12 months) the car is generally worth more than you paid for it when delivered. A friend purchased a reasonably specked 2021 Macan Turbo and was offered 10k more than he paid for it by the dealership on collection day......he refused it BTW. If you do any research or online reviews on the Macan model you would be very hard pressed to find anything particularly negative whichever model you choose, although most say the Macan S is the 'sweet spot' model to purchase.

Koln-RS,"Don't know much about the Macan. Always resented Porsche deviating from pure sports cars, and never liked the original Cayenne, although do have very positive experiences of the subsequent 'new' model Cayenne.I realise these are luxury SUVs, for practical family transport, but, a year or more after launch, I'd be interested to know how owners rate them.What's the difference between the Diesel and Petrol models? And how does it compare with the Cayenne? Playing with the configurator, you can get the prices pretty close. ","March 13, 2016"
tree7777,"The residuals are league above Cayenne. I have had 2 with one on order. Down sides have Been sat Nav dated (new models from this year have new system so much, much better) boot space. angle on bootlid means boot smaller than you would think but still ok. Indicator and cruse control controls a bit plastic looking. Upside is everything else engines great, drive great. Just a lovey car. I have DS model which is as fast as you need on UK roads but have the GTS on order just to be sure!!! ","March 13, 2016"
atom111,"I've a Petrol turbo covered over 32000 miles now, it's been a joy think my only complaint might be the rear wiper switch is a bit rubbish, everything else has been great it's had a few warranty items but the dealer has been excellent.I had Cayenne prior, the Macan is more fun and for what it is more nimble always nice to get back in the Macan after driving other cars.It's been great for long runs get out feeling refreshed, and agree with the other post that the boot is s little smaller than expected.Great car and it will be two years old in July the longest time I've kept a car, it's quite hard to think what would replace it other than the same again. ","March 13, 2016"
ZeroH,"If you actually want a family car then imo its not a patch on the Cayenne.... by comparison its cramped in the back, has none of the rear seat flexibility, small boot, cramped drivers footwell, has much stodgier gloopy steering feel, interior feels much cheaper, and when I was given one as a loaner for a few days in place of my Cayenne Turbo I really missed the height adjustable suspension and overall feeling of well-being. It felt like a jacked up hatchback frankly. My wife also thought it was pointless.So personally I cant see what all the fuss is about but it seems like owners of them like them well enough. ","March 13, 2016"
ORD,I intended to test drive one recently but decided against it after just sitting in it. Tiny interior compared to its external dimensions. I cannot see why you would ever buy one above the Cayenne. ,"March 15, 2016"
EricE,"Relatively speaking the Macan is Porsche's ""hot hatch"".Feels surprisingly nimble on the road, is fun to drive, goes like stink and has very little usable space inside but usually enough to get by if you don't have children.I agree with ZeroH's comments, the Cayenne is far better value for money if you're looking for a family car with 4 full seats + luggage. I find that even the Cayenne is not exactly spacious inside compared to an A4 Avant or A6/Skoda Superb. ","March 15, 2016"
Dr S,"I can only recommend a test drive. The Macan is a joy to drive when compared to its peers. It has a very supple ride and offers an impressively agile handling compared to its peers. Where the Cayenne feels like a truck compared to it - in terms of ride, handling and gearbox. Macan downsides are the interior materials (you need to option it up) and space which both a class below what the Cayenne offers (and the electric steering wich has a strange feel as all of these systems). It is the only SUV I'd ever consider.ETA: This is all based on driving a Macan Turbo and a Cayenne SEdited by Dr S on Tuesday 15th March 10:56 Edited by Dr S on Tuesday 15th March 10:56 ","March 15, 2016"

Geneve,"I have had a Cayenne 3.0d for 5 years - family duties and long-haul trips - and it's been superb.Currently have a high spec Macan Diesel 'S' on loan, so it's an interesting comparison.I wouldn't say it's that much smaller. Yes, the Cayenne looks and feels bigger next to it, but the Macan is still a practical size for most purposes.My first impressions are that it is much more car-like and sportier to drive, with superior performance, handling and economy. Ride feels very good, but this one has 21"" wheels on Pirelli P-Zeros and, despite Air & PASM, feels a touch fidgety on some UK roads. From Cayenne experience, I think 20"" on 'all seasons' would give a more relaxed ride.Inevitably, the big consideration is the options list. You can create a mighty impressive vehicle, but £20ks of options is easily consumed.One point; spoke to a chap at the OPC and he said the 'petrol' and 'diesel' Macans do feel like very different cars. My preference for this type of vehicle would normally be 'diesel', but anyone compared both? ","March 15, 2016"
ORD,Diesel Porsche. Jesus wept. ,"March 15, 2016"
Malo,My wife had a Macan DS which she thought was a nice car - She now has an X5 M40d which she likes much more than the Macan. (I do also - Tech in the X5 is years ahead of the Macan). ,"March 15, 2016"
Bernardino,"I was loaned a nicely specced 2ltr version by my local OPC for a few days while my 997 was having some work done and I was very impressed. Managed to fit 2 adults in the back and 2 dogs in the boot easily. Even though I wouldn't buy this version the 2 ltr engine coped very well for the size of the car, only a tiny bit of lag but was comfortable on a long motorway run.Have also driven the turbo version which would be the one to go for if I was choosing, it's comfortable and quiet when it needs to be but for that type of the car the engine is something else.Have had the latest Cayenne on loan too, believe it was the 3.0d v6, was suprised at how nimble it felt given the size of it. It does feel so much more bigger than the Macan and I actually prefered the interior of the Macan, maybe because it felt more enclosed ","March 15, 2016"

bompey,"I have a petrol Turbo which will be 2 years old in July and I love it. I will be getting Macan 2 in July which is a GTS.It depends on your needs but as I only have 1 teenager so it makes sense for me. The cayenne is too big, 911 or cayman too small so this does the job perfectly. We recently tried a Cayenne and my wife didn't like it compared to the macan. The DSG gearbox is superb and makes it a great all round car. Try one! ","March 15, 2016"
